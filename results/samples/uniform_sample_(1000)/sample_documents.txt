Will helminth co-infection modulate COVID-19 severity in endemic regions?

As COVID-19 spreads through the world, most cases to date are in middle- and high-income nations. The impact on resource-poor nations remains unknown. Amongst many factors likely to affect the impact of COVID-19 in these areas, co-infections need to be considered. Here, we discuss whether the immunomodulatory effects of helminth infections may affect COVID-19 severity.

Chapter 2 Virus Replication

Abstract The replication processes used by individual viruses is highly variable. However, all viruses must attach to a susceptible host cell, enter the cell, disassemble the virus particle (uncoating), replicate its own genetic material and express the associated proteins, assemble new virus particles, and escape from the infected cell (release). This chapter will outline the general processes involved in each of these steps.

Viral and Prion Infections

Many human diseases are due to viruses. These agents consist of genomes of either DNA or RNA inside a protein shell. Despite this deceptive simplicity, virus infections are less well understood than bacterial diseases, largely because viruses cannot be grown alone in culture but depend on a host cell. Until recently, protection against virus diseases relied on public health measures and vaccination. Only since the late 1980s have a significant number of specific antiviral agents become available.

The relationship between respiratory virus infection and asthma has long been recognized, though remains incompletely understood. In this article, we will address key issues around this relationship. These will include the crucial role virus infection plays in early life, as a potential risk factor for the development of asthma and lung disease. We will assess the impact that virus infection has on those with established asthma as a trigger for acute disease and how this may influence asthma throughout life. Finally, we will explore the complex interaction that occurs between the airway and the immune responses that make those with asthma so susceptible to the effects of virus infection.

Calcineurin inhibitors revisited: A new paradigm for COVID-19?

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause mild, moderate or severe disease (COVID-19). In severe disease, there is hyperinflammation causing severe symptoms. Severe COVID-19 is an immunological phenomenon, rather than a direct viral damage disease. Therapies for COVID-19 are all investigational therapies. In case of severe disease, treatment with a calcineurin inhibitor could be promising. In this article we explain the mechanisms of calcineurin inhibitor treatment for COVID-19, based on experiences seen in solid organ transplant recipients who suffered from COVID-19.

New pharmacological strategies to fight enveloped viruses

Enveloped viruses pose an important health threat because most of the persistent and many emerging viruses are enveloped. In particular, newly emerging viruses create a need to develop broad-spectrum antivirals, which usually are obtained by targeting host cell factors. Persistent viruses have developed efficient strategies to escape host immune control, and treatment options are limited. Targeting host cell factors essential for virus persistence, or immune-based therapies provide alternative approaches. In this review, we therefore focus on recent developments to generate antivirals targeting host cell factors or immune-based therapeutic approaches to fight infections with enveloped viruses.

Why were Turks unwilling to accept the A/H1N1 influenza-pandemic vaccination? People's beliefs and perceptions about the swine flu outbreak and vaccine in the later stage of the epidemic.

This study investigated the acceptability of the A/H1N1 influenza vaccination and related factors among 1137 adults in the later stage of the A/H1N1 outbreak in Turkey. Having already been vaccinated or intending to get vaccinated were related to trust in the vaccine effectiveness, perceived risk of the side effects, and benefits of getting vaccinated. Perceived long term consequences of the A/H1N1 infection, perceptions of the A/H1N1 information in media, and barriers for getting vaccinated were related to intention whereas anticipated epidemic situation in Turkey, being chronically ill, and being not married were related to having already been vaccinated.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus protein 6 is required for optimal replication.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encodes several accessory proteins of unknown function. One of these proteins, protein 6 (p6), which is encoded by ORF6, enhances virus replication when introduced into a heterologous murine coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus [MHV]) but is not essential for optimal SARS-CoV replication after infection at a relatively high multiplicity of infection (MOI). Here, we reconcile these apparently conflicting results by showing that p6 enhances SARS-CoV replication to nearly the same extent as when expressed in the context of MHV if cells are infected at a low MOI and accelerates disease in mice transgenic for the human SARS-CoV receptor.

Vaccinia Virus-Based Reverse Genetics for Feline Coronaviruses

For decades, the genetic modification of coronavirus genomes and the generation of recombinant coronaviruses have been hampered mostly due to the extraordinary large size of the coronaviral genome. The very first reverse genetic system for feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) was established in the early 2000s; the respective approach exclusively enabled the manipulation of the 3′-third of the viral genome. Later on, vaccinia virus- and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based systems have been developed. Both systems have the advantage that the entire FCoV genome is amenable for mutagenesis. The main focus of this chapter is the vaccinia virus-based reverse genetic system for FCoVs. Here we present protocols for (1) the generation of a full-length cDNA clone, (2) the manipulation of the FCoV genome, and (3) the rescue of recombinant FCoVs.

Metabolische Störungen

Bei fortgeschrittenem Organversagen von Niere, Herz, Leber oder Lunge stellt eine Organtransplantation meist das einzige kurative Therapieverfahren dar. Auch eine Knochenmarktransplantation wird bei sonst unheilbaren Leukämien oder Lymphomen eingesetzt. Nach Organtransplantation treten bei 30–60% der Patienten neurologische Komplikationen auf. Differenzialdiagnostisch müssen vorbestehende, durch die Grunderkrankung bedingte, Störungen von intraoperativen Komplikationen, von metabolisch bedingten neurologischen Störungen und von Nebenwirkungen der notwendigen immunsuppressiven Medikation abgegrenzt werden. Immunsuppressiva können dabei sowohl eine direkte Neurotoxizität als auch indirekt vermehrt Infektionen des Zentralnervensystems (ZNS) und sekundäre ZNS-Malignome verursachen. Während metabolische Enzephalopathien oder opportunistische ZNS-Infektionen bei allen Patienten nach Transplantation etwa gleich häufig auftreten können, sind andere neurologische Syndrome für bestimmte Organtransplantationen typisch.

Clinical and Epidemiological Features of a Family Cluster of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection

This report describes the clinical and virological characteristics of three children in a family cluster experiencing infection with SARS-CoV2. While the youngest child was not infected, both parents and the two 2- and 5 years-old children became infected. The children were only briefly symptomatic with predominant gastrointestinal symptoms. They initially shed infectious virus from the upper respiratory tract, but cleared the virus after five to six days in the nasopharynx. However, SARS-CoV2 RNA was continuously detected in the stools of the children for more than 4 weeks indicating a predominant replication within the gastrointestinal tract.

RNAi, a new therapeutic strategy against viral infection

RNA interference (RNAi) is an adaptive defense mechanism triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). It is a powerful reverse genetic tool that has been widely employed to silence gene expression in mammalian and human cells. RNAi-based gene therapies, especially in viral diseases have become more and more interesting and promising. Recently, small interfering RNA (siRNA) can be used to protect host from viral infection, inhibit the expression of viral antigen and accessory genes, control the transcription and replication of viral genome, hinder the assembly of viral particles, and display influences in virus-host interactions. In this review, we attempt to present recent progresses of this breakthrough technology in the above fields and summarize the possibilities of siRNA-based drugs.

Effects of Social Grooming on Incivility in COVID-19.

This study implements a computer-assisted content analysis to identify which social grooming factors reduce social media users' incivility when commenting or posting about the COVID-19 situation in South Korea. In addition, this study conducts semantic network analysis to interpret qualitatively how people express their thoughts. The findings suggest that social network size is a negative predictor of incivility. Moreover, Twitter users who have built larger networks and gained positive responses from others are less likely to use uncivil language. Lastly, linguistic choice among users is different depending on the size of their social network.

Detention for tuberculosis: public health and the law.

Non-compliance with treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) by an individual can put the community at risk of transmission of TB. Public health (detention) orders can be issued to detain non-compliant individuals, but this is a last resort and rarely used. Two recent cases in New South Wales illustrate the process of issuing a public health order in NSW, and some of the issues that may arise. The NSW law can also be applied to patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or HIV/AIDS. The other states and territories have similar laws, which often apply to a broader range of diseases and have fewer limits on issuing and extending orders.

Epidemiological Features of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak in China.

The fast-growing outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which originated from Wuhan locating in central China at the end of 2019, spread to multiple cities in merely a month. Although the mortality of this disease was lower than that of SARS, the incredible contagiousness was much higher than SRAS-CoV. Because of the tremendous clout of 2019-nCoV, it is essential to hold more details about it and monitor its future evolution. This mini review consequently summarizes the key elements of epidemiology features, providing updated relevant findings and novel insights related to 2019-nCoV.

An emergent clade of SARS-CoV-2 linked to returned travellers from Iran

The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has rapidly spread outside China with major outbreaks occurring in Italy, South Korea, and Iran. Phylogenetic analyses of whole-genome sequencing data identified a distinct SARS-CoV-2 clade linked to travellers returning from Iran to Australia and New Zealand. This study highlights potential viral diversity driving the epidemic in Iran, and underscores the power of rapid genome sequencing and public data sharing to improve the detection and management of emerging infectious diseases.

Nosocomial Tuberculosis in India

Most high-income countries implement tuberculosis (TB) infection control programs to reduce the risk for nosocomial transmission. However, such control programs are not routinely implemented in India, the country that accounts for the largest number of TB cases in the world. Despite the high prevalence of TB in India and the expected high probability of nosocomial transmission, little is known about nosocomial and occupational TB there. The few available studies suggest that nosocomial TB may be a problem. We review the available data on this topic, describe factors that may facilitate nosocomial transmission in Indian healthcare settings, and consider the feasibility and applicability of various recommended infection control interventions in these settings. Finally, we outline the critical information needed to effectively address the problem of nosocomial transmission of TB in India.

What did we learn from the previous coronavirus epidemics and what can we do better: a neuroinfectiological point of view

We are learning gradually about the neurologic manifestations during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID)‐19 pandemic, a respiratory disease related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). As the clinical evidence is still limited, it makes a sense to critically analyze the spectrum of neurologic involvement caused by SARS‐CoV‐1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV), which were causal for epidemics in 2003 and 2012, respectively.

Tools for Model Building and Optimization into Near-Atomic Resolution Electron Cryo-Microscopy Density Maps

Electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) has advanced dramatically to become a viable tool for high-resolution structural biology research. The ultimate outcome of a cryoEM study is an atomic model of a macromolecule or its complex with interacting partners. This chapter describes a variety of algorithms and software to build a de novo model based on the cryoEM 3D density map, to optimize the model with the best stereochemistry restraints and finally to validate the model with proper protocols. The full process of atomic structure determination from a cryoEM map is described. The tools outlined in this chapter should prove extremely valuable in revealing atomic interactions guided by cryoEM data.

Community-acquired pneumonia in pregnancy.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a common disease worldwide, with considerable morbidity and mortality. In the United States, pneumonia complicates 0.5 to 1.5 per 1,000 pregnancies. Physiologic adaptations in the respiratory and immunologic systems may increase susceptibility to pulmonary infections as well as alter their clinical course. Bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens all cause pneumonia in pregnancy, although the causative agent is identified in only 40-60% of cases. The most common single pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is identified in 15-20% of community-acquired pneumonia cases in pregnancy. Recent recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society on the management of community-acquired pneumonia address diagnostic techniques and management schemes for bacterial and viral pneumonias. These guidelines are discussed in the setting of the pregnant woman with community-acquired pneumonia.

Ultrastructural Pathology of Oligodendroglial Cells in Traumatic and Hydrocephalic Human Brain Edema: A Review.

Oligodendroglial cell changes in human traumatic brain injuries and hydrocephalus have been reviewed and compared with experimental brain edema. Resting unreactive oligodendrocytes, reactive oligodendrocytes, anoxic-ischemic oligodendrocytes, hyperthrophic phagocytic oligodendrocytes, and apoptotic oligodendrocytes are found. Anoxic-ischemic oligodendrocytes exhibit enlargement of endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, and enlargement and disassembly of nuclear envelope. They appear in contact with degenerated myelinated axons. Hypertrophic phagocytic oligodendrocytes engulf degenerated myelinated axons exerting myelinolytic effects. A continuum oncotic and apoptotic cell death type leading to necrosis is observed. The vasogenic and cytotoxic components of brain edema are discussed in relation to oligodendroglial cell changes and reactivity.

Association of Increased Prenatal Estrogen With Risk Factors for Schizophrenia

The author previously described a theoretical cause of schizophrenia based on the effects of estrogenic endocrine disruption. In the current review, the author describes how increased estrogen during pregnancy increases susceptibility to certain viral infections associated with increased risk for schizophrenia. The review further discusses how prenatal estrogen exposure could explain associations of schizophrenia with autoimmune diseases, urban environments, and stress. Based on the association of increased estrogen with schizophrenia risk factors, the author proposes increased prenatal estrogen as a unifying factor, perhaps the primary event, in the etiology of schizophrenia.

Epidemic spreading model of COVID-19

We study Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic-Infectious-Recovered (SEAIR) epidemic spreading model inspired by two characteristics of the infectiousness of COVID-19: delayed start and its appearance before onset of symptoms, or even with total absence of them. The model is theoretically analyzed in continuous-time compartmental version and discrete-time version on random regular graphs and complex networks. We show analytically that there are relationships between the epidemic thresholds and the equations for the susceptible populations at the endemic equilibrium in all three versions, which hold when the epidemic is weak. We provide theoretical arguments that eigenvector centrality of a node approximately determines its risk to become infected.

Immunologie

Die Mechanismen der Immunabwehr, mit denen ein Organismus Virusinfektionen bekämpft, können in zwei Gruppen eingeteilt werden. Zum einen gibt es die unspezifischen, nichtadaptativen Immunreaktionen, die eindringende Erreger als fremd erkennen und eliminieren. Diese sogenannte natürliche oder angeborene Immunabwehr wird als erste aktiv, nachdem ein Virus die äußeren physikalischen Schutzschranken des Körpers (Haut, Schleimhaut) überwunden hat. Sie besteht aus bestimmten Zellen, nämlich aus den dendritischen Zellen, den Granulocyten, den Monocyten und Makrophagen sowie den natürlichen Killerzellen. Diese verfügen über Proteine, die als Rezeptoren (beispielsweise toll-like-Rezeptoren, Komplementrezeptoren) für bestimmte Erregerstrukturen und für die löslichen Produkte des unspezifischen Immunsystems (Akutphaseproteine, die Faktoren des Komplementsystems, Cytokine, Chemokine und Interferone) dienen. Auf die Wirkung und Funktion der Cytokine, Chemokine und Interferone wird in ▸ Kapitel 8 gesondert eingegangen.

Commentary on “Health Spending Under Single-Payer Approaches”

One of the most controversial areas in discussions of single-payer approaches for the United States, such as “Medicare for All,” concerns its implications for costs. Confusion over differences between federal and total spending and effects of lower patient cost sharing gets in the way of “apples-to-apples” comparisons. Key areas with potential to lower costs are lower administrative costs and lower provider prices. But cost reduction would likely be smaller than some envision, especially in the price area because of the need for a long process to gradually allow providers to adjust to lower prices and Americans' unique attitudes toward regulation.

Double-stranded RNA stimulates the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells.

BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells were treated with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly IC), a synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) analog, and the expressions of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA and protein were analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Poly IC enhanced the expression of MCP-1 and release of mononuclear cell chemotactic activity, which were inhibited by dexamethasone pre-treatment. The poly IC-induced up-regulation of MCP-1 was blocked by 2-aminopurine, a specific inhibitor of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase, but not by nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB inhibitor SN50.

Retrocyclins and their activity against HIV-1

Primate theta-defensins are physically distinguished as the only known fully-cyclic peptides of animal origin. Humans do not produce theta-defensin peptides due to a premature stop codon present in the signal sequence of all six theta-defensin pseudogenes. Instead, since the putative coding regions of human theta-defensin pseudogenes have remained remarkably intact, their corresponding peptides, called “retrocyclins”, have been recreated using solid-phase synthetic approaches. Retrocyclins exhibit an exceptional therapeutic index both as inhibitors of HIV-1 entry and as bactericidal agents, which makes retrocyclins promising candidates for further development as topical microbicides to prevent sexually transmitted diseases. This review presents the evolution, antiretroviral mechanism of action, and potential clinical applications of retrocyclins to prevent sexual transmission of HIV-1.

The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak from a one health perspective

Abstract The SARS-CoV-2 is a new human coronavirus candidate recently detected in China that is now reported in people on inhabited continents. The virus shares a high level of identity with some bat coronaviruses and is recognised as a potentially zoonotic virus. We are utilizing the One Health concept to understand the emergence of the virus, as well as to point to some possible control strategies that might reduce the spread of the virus across the globe; thus, containment of such virus would be possible.

Low prevalence of subclinical severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infection among hospital healthcare workers in Hong Kong.

We recruited 688 hospital healthcare workers who cared for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and did not develop the disease in the Hong Kong outbreak in 2003. A questionnaire survey was conducted and serum samples were collected for SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) antibody. The high-risk procedures performed and the types of unprotected exposures were recorded for analysis. Only 1 asymptomatic nurse had positive serological test. The result demonstrates the low rate of subclinical SARS-CoV infection in hospital healthcare workers and that the infection control practice against SARS in Hong Kong's hospitals during the outbreak was highly effective.

Foal Diarrhea Established and Postulated Causes, Prevention, Diagnostics, and Treatments

Diarrhea is one of the most important diseases in young foals and may occur in more than half of foals until weaning age. Several infectious and noninfectious underlying causes have been implicated but scientific evidence of pathogenesis is evolving. It is important to investigate all known potential causes and identify infectious agents to avoid outbreaks, evaluate the level of systemic compromise, and establish adequate therapy. It is crucial to differentiate foals that can be managed in field conditions from those that should be sent to a referral center. This article reviews these aspects and recent developments in the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

Whatever Happened to Evidence-Based Practice During COVID-19?

Contemporary medical practice is grounded in rigorous scientific evidence in concert with best clinical practices and informed shared decision making with patients. During these times of uncertainty, disruption, and even anxiety, it becomes critical that we engage with our patients and communities in thoughtful dialogue and realistic expectations regarding treatments surrounding COVID-19. The hope for a "miracle" cure and urgency to return back to normal times can stimulate irrational thought and behavior and even desperate measures by individuals or groups. It becomes especially important that we continue to use reasonable, informed clinical judgment in discussing the various options with patients.

IFITM proteins inhibit HIV-1 protein synthesis

Interferon induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) inhibit the cellular entry of a broad range of viruses, but it has been suspected that for HIV-1 IFITMs may also inhibit a post-integration replicative step. We show that IFITM expression reduces HIV-1 viral protein synthesis by preferentially excluding viral mRNA transcripts from translation and thereby restricts viral production. Codon-optimization of proviral DNA rescues viral translation, implying that IFITM-mediated restriction requires recognition of viral RNA elements. In addition, we find that expression of the viral accessory protein Nef can help overcome the IFITM-mediated inhibition of virus production. Our studies identify a novel role for IFITMs in inhibiting HIV replication at the level of translation, but show that the effects can be overcome by the lentiviral protein Nef.

The non-structural protein Nsp10 of mouse hepatitis virus binds zinc ions and nucleic acids

The non-structural protein Nsp10 of coronaviruses is a small cleavage product of the viral replicase polyprotein that has been implicated in RNA synthesis. Nsp10 of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) displays an apparent molecular mass of 13–16 kDa in reducing SDS–PAGE and analytical gel filtration, while dynamic light scattering suggests the existence of oligomeric forms. Atomic absorption spectroscopy reveals two metal ions per Nsp10 monomer, with a preference for Zn(2+) over Fe(2+/3+) and Co(2+). These are probably bound by two Zn-finger-like motifs. Moreover, MHV Nsp10 interacts with tRNA, single-stranded RNA, double-stranded DNA and, to a lesser extent, single-stranded DNA as shown by gel-shift experiments. The K(d) for tRNA is 2.1 ± 0.2 μM.

Heavier Group‐2‐Element Catalyzed Hydroamination of Carbodiimides

The heteroleptic calcium amide [{ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr}Ca{N(SiMe(3))(2)}(THF)] (Ar = 2,6‐diisopropylphenyl) and the homoleptic heavier alkaline earth amides, [M{N(SiMe(3))(2)}(2)(THF)(2)] (M = Ca, Sr and Ba) are reported as competent pre‐catalysts for the hydroamination of 1,3‐carbodiimides. Whilst the reaction scope is currently limited to reactions of aromatic amines with 1,3‐dialkylcarbodiimides, in most cases preparations in hydrocarbon solvents proceed rapidly at room temperature with catalyst loadings as low as 0.2 mol‐% and the guanidine reaction products crystallize directly from the reaction mixture. Initial studies are consistent with the intermediacy of heavier group‐2 guanidinate complexes.(© Wiley‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 69451 Weinheim, Germany, 2008)

Urticarial eruption in coronavirus disease 2019 infection: a case report in Tangerang, Indonesia

We have read with great interest the articles regarding cutaneous manifestations in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Studies showed 20.4% of COVID-19 patients developed cutaneous manifestations and might be the only presenting symptom.(1) To date, previous cases reported urticaria as one of the cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19.(2)(1)(3)(4) This atypical symptom might lead to misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis, and virus transmission, especially in countries where cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 has not been reported widely such as in Indonesia. We would like to report a case of urticaria in COVID-19-positive non-ICU hospitalized patient from Indonesia to bring awareness to its cutaneous manifestations.

Severity and risk of COVID-19 in cancer patients: An evidence-based learning

The immune system of cancer patient gets compromised because of cancer therapy, surgery, and malignancy and thus the probability of infection are increased than the general patients. Immunosuppression can expose cancer patients to serious complications which can lead to delay in diagnosis and unnecessary hospitalizations that may adversely affect the prognosis of the disease. Patients who received chemotherapy or surgery within the 30 days before novel coronavirus disease pandemic have more risk of infection than the patients who had not undergone chemotherapy or surgery.

Structural basis for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 main protease by antineoplastic drug Carmofur

The antineoplastic drug Carmofur was shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Here the X-ray crystal structure of Mpro in complex with Carmofur reveals that the carbonyl reactive group of Carmofur is covalently bound to catalytic Cys145, whereas its fatty acid tail occupies the hydrophobic S2 subsite. Carmofur inhibits viral replication in cells (EC50 = 24.30 μM) and it is a promising lead compound to develop new antiviral treatment for COVID-19.

Advances in interventional pulmonology.

Interventional pulmonology (IP) remains a rapidly expanding and evolving subspecialty focused on the diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases of the thorax. As the field continues to push the leading edge of medical technology, new procedures allow for novel minimally invasive approaches to old diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and metastatic or primary lung malignancy. In addition to technologic advances, IP has matured into a defined subspecialty, requiring formal training necessary to perform the advanced procedures. This need for advanced training has led to the need for standardization of training and the institution of a subspecialty board examination. In this review, we will discuss the dynamic field of IP as well as novel technologies being investigated or employed in the treatment of thoracic disease.

Comment on “Cutaneous manifestations in COVID‐19: a first perspective ” by Recalcati S

Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) outbreak was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan on December 31, 2019, it has stricken more than 1,000,000 persons worldwide, of whom over 50,000 have died (1). Having been infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐COV‐2), patients with COVID‐19 mainly present with fever and respiratory symptoms (2). Isolated sudden onset anosmia has also frequently been reported (3). Less frequently, rhinorrhea, diarrhoea and dysgeusia may be associated. While only a few reports have evoked cutaneous manifestations (4), we read with interest an initial study on the topic entitled “Cutaneous manifestations in COVID‐19: a first perspective ” by Recalcati S.

Lessons Learned After 15 Years of Circumferential Bodylift Surgery.

Circumferential bodylift is a powerful procedure for achieving dramatic and natural body contouring changes in the massive weight loss patient. The care of these patients has raised our awareness of several important issues including safety, nutritional status, skin quality, recurrent laxity, surgical steps, and postoperative scars. Integration of this knowledge with various technical modifications over the last 15 years has improved our care for this cohort. We have not only seen a rise in the number of surgeries performed, but also the development of principles, techniques, and details that the authors feel necessary to share to achieve improved contour and more predictable outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 4: Therapeutic.

Antiserum to the gp116 glycoprotein of yellow head virus neutralizes infectivity in primary lymphoid organ cells of Penaeus monodon.

Yellow head virus (YHV) is an invertebrate nidovirus that has caused mass mortality of cultured Penaeus monodon in Asia. In this study, we investigated whether mouse polyclonal antiserum raised against the YHV gp116 or gp64 structural glycoproteins could neutralize YHV infectivity as determined using an in vitro quantal assay in primary cultures of lymphoid organ cells. Anti-gp116 antiserum showed virus-neutralizing activity whereas anti-gp64 antiserum failed to inhibit infection. The results suggest that gpl16 antiserum blocks binding of virions to cellular receptors to facilitate YHV entry into lymphoid organ cells.

Chemical linkage of erythrocytes and viral antigen in the hemolysis-in-gel (HIG) test for viral antibodies

The sensitivity of the hemolysis-in-gel (HIG) test with rubella antigen is not improved by chemical linkage of the virus to the erythrocytes, and after such modification, IgM specific antibodies are not detectable. In the influenza HIG test with tetraazotized o-dianisidine (TOD), chromic chloride and potassium periodate as coupling reagents, increased sensitivity was observed with allantoic fluid of infected eggs as antigen. If Tween-ether treated hemagglutinin is used in the HIG test, zones of hemolysis are detectable only after treatment of the erythrocytes with TOD, chromic chloride and potassium periodate.

Recombinant poxvirus vaccines in biomedical research

In biomedical research recombinant poxviruses are investigated as important candidate medicines to derive advanced options for prevention and/or treatment of infectious diseases or cancer. Genetically engineered viruses can readily synthesize biologically active heterologous proteins, serve to determine relevant targets of cell-mediated and humoral immunity, and identify types of immune responses needed for protection against a multitude of different specific diseases. Substantial progress in vaccine development is based on the availability of exceptionally safe but efficient carrier viruses, on increasingly versatile vector technologies and on the feasibility of large scale manufacturing. Moreover, advances in deciphering the molecular pathways regulating poxvirus-host interactions will provide additional means to potently activate innate immune stimulation upon vaccination and to derive vectors with specifically targeted replicative capacity for experimental tumor therapy.

Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic, Meaningful Communication between Family Caregivers and Residents of Long-Term Care Facilities is Imperative

Older adults residing in long-term care facilities are especially vulnerable for severe illness or death from COVID-19. To contain the transmission of the virus in long-term care facilities, federal health officials have issued strict visitation guidelines, restricting most visits between residents and all visitors, including family members. Yet, many older adults rely on family care for social support and to maintain their health, well-being, and safety in long-term care facilities, and therefore need to stay connected to their families. The federal government, state and local leaders, and long-term care facilities should take further actions to enable the relationship between residents of long-term care facilities and families during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We herein report three ischemic stroke patients who underwent emergency carotid artery stenting after receiving intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) treatment. All patients received antiplatelet medications immediately before stent placement for loading as well as dual antiplatelet therapy after stenting. Under high-dose and dual antiplatelet therapy, none of the three patients showed symptomatic intracranial hemorrhaging. However, one case showed reocclusion of the placed stent after acute thrombosis. As a result, new treatment strategies for the use of antiplatelet agents during emergency stent placement must be developed, particularly for patients who have received intravenous t-PA therapy.

Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma: a minimally invasive means to nephron preservation.

With the advent of cross-sectional imaging, the incidence of asymptomatic detected small renal masses, 'incidentalomas', has increased in the past 20 years. Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with renal masses have worse renal function at baseline and have more comorbidities than the general population. Nephron-sparing surgery allows for maximal preservation of functioning nephrons with comparable oncologic outcomes. Recently, laparoscopic partial nephrectomy has emerged as a minimally invasive nephron-sparing surgical option for treating the appropriately selected renal mass. While open-partial nephrectomy has undisputedly become standard of care for the management of the small renal mass (<4 cm), laparoscopic partial nephrectomy is becoming the preferred option for select patients in institutions in which advanced laparoscopic experience is available.

Framing consumer food demand responses in a viral pandemic

In this paper I explore several issues related to how the COVID‐19 pandemic might impact consumer demand for food. These impacts relate to the structure of preferences in the context of a pandemic, income and time constraints, and price effects. Discussion includes accounting for differential impacts of COVID‐19 on demand for food across sociodemographic characteristics, and several high‐level issues and observations related to where and how consumers shop and what they buy. My own thinking leads me to conclude that demand‐side factors will account for most of the changes we see in retail food market. These demand‐side effects will be dominated by income effects, the opportunity cost of time, and longer planning horizons on the part of consumers.

Concurrent cryptosporidium and coronavirus infections in an Arabian foal with combined immunodeficiency syndrome.

Combined immunodeficiency syndrome is an inherited disorder of the Arabian breed of horses. Affected foals usually die of infectious disease within the first few months of life, and the respiratory tract is the commonest site of infection. This report describes the clinical and pathological features of a case which showed signs of alimentary and respiratory infections. Intestinal infection by coronavirus (not previously recorded in cases of the syndrome) and cryptosporidia was identified. Histopathological evidence also suggested the presence of an adenovirus infection.

Vaccines for the prevention of respiratory viral infections: problems and current status.

Acute respiratory virus infections cause the majority of lower respiratory tract illnesses and hospitalisations of infants and the elderly. The emergence of new respiratory viruses and a high probability that influenza will cause further pandemics highlights the necessity for developing better preventative strategies. Although there is a clear and pressing need for vaccines to prevent respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, parainfluenza and human metapneumovirus, progress has been extremely slow. This review presents the current status of vaccine development for respiratory viral diseases and outlines novel approaches for the future.

Increasing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio: COVID-19 Clinical Synopsis for Outpatient Providers

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which is the cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19 formally 2019-nCoV), has received widespread attention from the medical community. Despite the rapid publication of research on the virus and the disease it causes, there is a lack of concise and relevant material to help busy medical providers navigate recognition and management of the disease in the ambulatory setting. This review article aims to bridge this gap by briefly reviewing the key points of the evaluation and treatment of patients with COVID-19 in the ambulatory clinic environment.

Inference for discretely observed stochastic kinetic networks with applications to epidemic modeling.

We present a new method for Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based inference in certain types of stochastic models, suitable for modeling noisy epidemic data. We apply the so-called uniformization representation of a Markov process, in order to efficiently generate appropriate conditional distributions in the Gibbs sampler algorithm. The approach is shown to work well in various data-poor settings, that is, when only partial information about the epidemic process is available, as illustrated on the synthetic data from SIR-type epidemics and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention data from the onset of the H1N1 pandemic in the United States.

Human Bocavirus: Lessons Learned to Date

Human bocavirus (HBoV) was identified as the second human parvovirus with pathogenic potential in 2005 in respiratory samples from children suffering from viral respiratory infections of unknown etiology. Since its first description, a large number of clinical studies have been performed that address the clinical significance of HBoV detection and the molecular biology of the virus. This review summarizes the most important steps taken in HBoV research to date and addresses open questions that need to be answered in the future to provide a better understanding of the role of a virus that is difficult to grow in cell culture and is suspected to be a pathogen, although it has not yet fulfilled Koch’s postulates.

Inferring super-spreading from transmission clusters of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore

Super-spreading events in an outbreak can change the nature of an epidemic. Therefore, it is useful for public health teams to determine if an ongoing outbreak has any contribution from such events, which may be amenable to interventions. We estimated the basic reproductive number (R0) and the dispersion factor (k) from empirical data on clusters of epidemiologically-linked COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore. This allowed us to infer the presence or absence of super-spreading events during the early phase of these outbreaks. The relatively large values of k implied that large cluster sizes, compatible with super-spreading, were unlikely.

Continuous evolution of avian infectious bronchitis virus resulting in different variants co-circulating in Southern China.

Sixty field strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were isolated from chicken flocks in different regions of Guangxi from 1985 to 2012. Phylogenetic analysis of S1 subunit glycoprotein genes revealed that field isolates from 2009-2011 mostly belonged to the LX4 type, while those from 1985-2008 belonged to the HN08 type, and a few others belonged to the 4/91 type, the TW type and the Mass type. In addition, it is noteworthy that no obvious regional differences were found among these 60 strains isolated from six regions in Guangxi, while there was a high degree of sequence identity among the isolates in the same period of time.

A simple and safe technique for performing single-port laparoscopic resection of appendiceal mucocele.

We report a new method of performing single-port laparoscopic surgery for appendiceal mucocele. The key points of our technique are placing a 3/4 circumferential skin incision with multiple radial splits on the confine of the umbilicus, use of a "home-made" multichannel port system, and trimming the skin incision straight through the confine of the umbilicus at the time of wound closure. A 65-year-old woman with appendiceal mucocele, 80 mm in diameter, successfully underwent ileocecal resection by this procedure. She remains in good health without any wound complications 8 months postoperatively.

Oncology Informatics: Status Quo and Outlook

Oncology has undergone rapid progress, with emerging developments in areas including cancer stem cells, molecularly targeted therapies, genomic analyses, and individually tailored immunotherapy. These advances have expanded the tools available in the fight against cancer. Some of these have seen broad media coverage resulting in justified public attention. However, these achievements have only been possible due to rapid developments in the expanding field of biomedical informatics and information technology (IT). Artificial intelligence, radiomics, electronic health records, and electronic patient-reported outcome measures (ePROMS) are only a few of the developments enabling further progress in oncology. The promising impact of IT in oncology will only become reality through a multidisciplinary approach to the complex challenges ahead.

Inhibiting the deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs).

The diverse roles of deubiquitinating enzymes, or DUBs, in determining the fate of specific proteins continue to unfold. Concurrent with the revelation of DUBs as potential therapeutic targets are publications of small molecule inhibitors of these enzymes. In this review, we summarize these molecules and their associated data and suggest additional experiments to further validate and characterize these compounds. We believe the field of drug discovery against DUBs is still in its infancy, but advances in assay development, biophysical techniques, and screening libraries hold promise for identifying suitable agents that could advance into the clinic.

Veterinary vaccines

Vaccination of animals for the prevention of infectious diseases has been practised for a number of years with little change in product composition. Recent advances in molecular biology, pathogenesis and immunology have laid the groundwork for the development of a new generation of veterinary vaccines based on pure subunits as well as live vectored bacteria and viruses. Along with novel methods of antigen preparation, the use of new adjuvants and delivery systems will permit targeting of the appropriate immune response as well as offering flexibility in terms of vaccination protocols. These new technologies are also being applied to the development of vaccines to enhance animal productivity and to control reproduction.

RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase of SARS-CoV-2 as a Therapeutic Target.

The global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected more than 8.9 million people worldwide. This calls for urgent effective therapeutic measures. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity in viral transcription and replication has been recognized as an attractive target to design novel antiviral strategies. Although SARS-CoV-2 shares less genetic similarity with SARS-CoV (~79%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV (~50%), the respective RdRps of the three coronaviruses are highly conserved, suggesting that RdRp is a good broad-spectrum antiviral target for CoVs. In this review, we discuss the antiviral potential of RdRp inhibitors (mainly nucleoside analogues) with an aim to provide a comprehensive account of drug discovery on SARS-CoV-2.

Coccidioidomycosis in adolescents with lupus nephritis

Coccidioidomycosis, a fungal infection endemic in the southwestern United States, can cause life-threatening infections in immunosuppressed patients. We report the contrasting cases of two adolescents with lupus nephritis, treated with intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide and daily oral corticosteroids, who developed pulmonary coccidioidomycosis. One patient developed a fatal form of fulminant disseminated coccidioidomycosis, while the other patient developed a solitary pulmonary Coccidioides immitis abscess which was responsive to intravenous liposomal amphotericin and fluconazole therapy. Because serologies and initial X-ray studies can be negative, definitive diagnostic studies including bronchioaveolar lavage and needle aspiration should be performed when there is clinical suspicion of coccidioidomycosis in an immunocompromised patient. Immunosuppressed patients with coccidioidomycosis should receive early intravenous amphotericin therapy and may benefit from long-term suppressive antifungal therapy to prevent relapse.

Preliminary estimating the reproduction number of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Republic of Korea and Italy by 5 March 2020

Abstract The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and Italy has caused 6088 cases and 41 deaths in Republic of Korea and 3144 cases and 107 death in Italy by 5 March 2020. We modeled the transmission process in Republic of Korea and Italy with a stochastic model and estimated the basic reproduction number R 0 as 2.6 (95% CI: 2.3-2.9) or 3.2 (95% CI: 2.9-3.5) in Republic of Korea, under the assumption that the exponential growth starting on 31 January or 5 February 2020, and 2.6 (95% CI: 2.3-2.9) or 3.3 (95% CI: 3.0-3.6) in Italy, under the assumption that the exponential growth starting on 5 February or 10 February 2020.

Role for nonstructural protein 1 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in chemokine dysregulation.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus. Since its associated morbidity and mortality have been postulated to be due to immune dysregulation, we investigated which of the viral proteins is responsible for chemokine overexpression. To delineate the viral and cellular factor interactions, the role of four SARS coronavirus proteins, including nonstructural protein 1 (nsp-1), nsp-5, envelope, and membrane, were examined in terms of cytokine induction. Our results showed that the SARS coronavirus nsp-1 plays an important role in CCL5, CXCL10, and CCL3 expression in human lung epithelial cells via the activation of NF-kappaB.

Introductions and early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the New York City area

New York City (NYC) has emerged as one of the epicenters of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To identify the early transmission events underlying the rapid spread of the virus in the NYC metropolitan area, we sequenced the virus causing COVID-19 in patients seeking care at the Mount Sinai Health System. Phylogenetic analysis of 84 distinct SARS-CoV2 genomes indicates multiple, independent but isolated introductions mainly from Europe and other parts of the United States. Moreover, we find evidence for community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as suggested by clusters of related viruses found in patients living in different neighborhoods of the city.

Severe bronchiolitis in children

Bronchiolitis is a common, acute, contagious lower respiratory tract illness of infants and young children. The majority of cases are secondary to respiratory syncytial virus. There are a number of risk factors for severe disease, including children less than six weeks of age and patients with atopy and/or asthma. The management requires vigilant monitoring and high-quality supportive care, including impressive use of fluids and nutritional support. Further research on anti-virals is essential to prevent respiratory syncytial virus induced bronchiolitis. Fortunately, the prognosis for the majority of normal infants who develop bronchiolitis is good.

The role of cardiac imaging in hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients.

COVID-19 infection is associated with several cardiac complications with high rates of adverse outcomes. Cardiac imaging has different utility in different clinical scenarios, and the importance of minimizing healthcare worker exposure should be considered. Cardiac imaging should only be ordered if its benefits outweigh its risks, with anticipated changes in acute treatment and outcomes, and no suitable alternative of sufficient adequacy is available. Indications for advanced cardiac imaging for COVID-19 patients in the acute phase are limited, although follow-up imaging in the convalescent stage may provide prognostic importance in recovered COVID-19 patients with positive troponin or decompensated heart failure.

Managing COVID-19 disease in pediatric patients

Children are less likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 than adults and often have a milder course of COVID-19 disease and a lower case fatality rate. Children account for an estimated 1% to 5% of those diagnosed with COVID-19. Even so, preschool-aged children, infants, and children with underlying health conditions may still be at risk for severe disease and complications. Unique aspects of COVID-19 presentation and disease course in children and possible vertical transmission to newborns from COVID-19-positive mothers are discussed.

Bilateral medial displacement of the biceps tendon of origin: repair using polypropylene mesh and staples.

A three-year-old male greyhound was presented with acute onset right forelimb lameness because of medial displacement of the biceps tendon of origin. Ultrasonographic examination confirmed the diagnosis, and a concomitant partial tear of the medial glenohumeral ligament was detected during arthroscopy. To stabilise the biceps tendon, polypropylene mesh was fixed across the intertubercular groove to replace the torn transverse humeral retinaculum. Recovery was uneventful and lameness resolved. Fifteen months later, the dog was presented with medial displacement of the biceps tendon of origin of the left shoulder, and was treated successfully using the same technique.

Detection of antibodies to avian infectious bronchitis virus by a recombinant nucleocapsid protein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

Abstract The recombinant antigen obtained by cloning and expressing two IBV nucleocapsid protein fragments (143-414 aa, 281-414 aa) in Escherichia coli was used for the detection of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) specific antibodies in chicken sera by the indirect ELISA (rNpIBV-ELISA). As a result of testing 1524 serum samples the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of rNpIBV-ELISA when comparing those of the routine whole IBV ELISA have been shown to be 93.81% and 87.36%, respectively. The agreement value was 91.5%.

Low prevalence and disease severity of COVID‐19 in post‐liver transplant recipients—A single centre experience

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) is driving a present day global pandemic. Immunosuppressed patients are regarded as a high‐risk cohort. The following is a short report on COVID‐19 in liver transplant recipients (n = 5) from a high volume UK liver transplant unit with a large follow‐up cohort (n = 4500). Based on this limited data, liver transplant recipients appear to have a low incidence of COVID‐19, with less severe symptoms than expected, when compared with the general population and other solid organ recipients. This possibly could be related to self‐isolation adherence and/or the ‘ideal’ level of immunosuppression that favourably modulates the immune response to COVID‐19.

Pandemic influenza: implications for preparation and delivery of critical care services.

In a 5-week span during the 1918 influenza A pandemic, more than 2000 patients were admitted to Cook County Hospital in Chicago, with a diagnosis of either influenza or pneumonia; 642 patients, approximately 31% of those admitted, died, with deaths occurring predominantly in patients of age 25 to 30 years. This review summarizes basic information on the biology, epidemiology, control, treatment and prevention of influenza overall, and then addresses the potential impact of pandemic influenza in an intensive care unit setting. Issues that require consideration include workforce staffing and safety, resource management, alternate sites of care surge of patients, altered standards of care, and crisis communication.

Virus entry: old viruses, new receptors

The long-sought entry receptors for rubella, sindbis and respiratory syncytial viruses (RV, SV and RSV), together with the missing measles virus (MV) receptor for infection of epithelial cells, were identified in 2011. These have been major developments in the field of virus entry. In addition, 2011 was rich in new information about the interactions of MV, RSV and phleboviruses with DC-SIGN during infection of dendritic cells, a crucial step allowing the virus to breach the epithelial barrier and gain access to the lymph nodes. This faciliates dissemination to susceptible tissues where it can develop a vigorous and sustained replication, to eventually target specific organs from which it can propagate into the environment and efficiently infect new hosts, closing the merry-go-round of the virus cycle.

Increased viral titers and enhanced reactivity of antibodies to the spike glycoprotein of murine coronavirus produced by infection at pH 6

Abstract Infection of cell monolayers by murine coronavirus A59 at pH 6 rather than 7 yielded a ten-fold increase in the infectious titer and a remarkable enhancement of the reactivities of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against the spike glycoprotein in immunoblotting, immuno-precipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. These observations are very useful for detecting antibodies against the S glycoprotein of coronaviruses and enhancing infectious titers.

Challenges in identifying antibiotic resistance targets for point-of-care diagnostics in general practice

General practitioners stand at the front line of healthcare provision and have a pivotal role in the fight against increasing antibiotic resistance. In this respect, targeted antibiotic prescribing by general practitioners would help reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics, leading to reduced treatment failures, fewer side-effects for patients and a reduction in the (global) spread of antibiotic resistances. Current ‘gold standard’ antibiotic resistance detection strategies tend to be slow, taking up to 48 h to obtain a result, although the implementation of point-of-care testing by general practitioners could help achieve the goal of targeted antibiotic prescribing practices. However, deciding on which antibiotic resistances to include in a point-of-care diagnostic is not a trivial task, as outlined in this publication.

Chapter 12 Biology and Diseases of Dogs

Historically, the dog played an important role as a laboratory animal in biomedical research. Although numbers are declining, the use of dogs continues to be common in pharmacokinetics and cardiovascular studies. The normal biology of the dog as both a laboratory and a companion animal has been well studied and reference values are presented here as a clinical and experimental resource. This provides the necessary background to discuss the spontaneous diseases, including infectious and neoplastic conditions, prevalent in purpose bred as well as random source dogs used in biomedical research. In addition, diseases and conditions that arise secondary to the housing and experimental manipulation of dogs is discussed with emphasis on treatment and prevention.

Ablative techniques for the treatment of benign and malignant breast tumours.

Minimally invasive techniques like high intensity focused ultrasound, radiofrequency ablation, cryo-ablation, laser ablation and microwave ablation have been used to treat both breast fibroadenomata and breast cancer as an alternative to surgical excision, potentially reducing the complications, improving cosmesis and reducing hospital stay. This review describes the most common minimally invasive techniques available, their history and some of the studies performed with these techniques in both benign and malignant lesions. In addition we described some of the difficulties of using these minimally invasive techniques such as optimization of anaesthesia, imaging and immobilisation in order to increase the complete histopathological ablation rates.

New Vaccine Design and Delivery Technologies

Technological advances in immunology, protein design, and genetic delivery have unlocked new possibilities for vaccine concepts and delivery technologies that were previously inaccessible. These next-generation vaccine design efforts are particularly promising in their potential to provide solutions to challenging targets for which conventional approaches have proven ineffective—for example, a universal influenza vaccine. In this perspective, we discuss emerging approaches to vaccine design and engineering based on recent insights into immunology, structural biology, computational biology, and immunoengineering. We anticipate that these cutting-edge, interdisciplinary approaches will lead to breakthrough vaccine concepts for ever-evolving and (re)emerging influenza viruses, with important ramifications for global public health.

Single Particle Tracking Assay to Study Coronavirus Membrane Fusion

Single particle tracking (SPT) of individual virion fusion with host cell membranes using total internal reflection microscopy (TIRFM) is a powerful technique for quantitatively characterizing virus–host interactions. One significant limitation of this assay to its wider use across many types of enveloped viruses, such as coronavirus, has been incorporating non-lipid receptors (proteins) into the supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) used to monitor membrane fusion. Here, we describe a method for incorporating a proteinaceous viral receptor, feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN), into SLBs using cell blebbing of mammalian cells expressing fAPN in the plasma membrane. This receptor binds feline coronavirus (FECV 1683). We describe how to carry out single particle tracking of FECV fusion in this SLB platform to obtain fusion kinetics.

A near-fatal infection with oseltamivir-resistant seasonal influenza A in a previously healthy child: Case report.

A case of near-fatal oseltamivir-resistant seasonal influenza A infection in a previously healthy four-year-old boy is reported. This case highlights three important points for physicians: oseltamivir-resistant influenza A (H1N1) has recently emerged in North America; contrary to previously held beliefs, such strains are capable of causing severe disease in healthy children; and given this change in epidemiology, clinicians caring for children with severe seasonal influenza A infection should consider empiric dual therapy with oseltamivir and amantadine.

Zukunftsszenarien für die Logistikdienstleistung im Jahr 2025

Die Logistik hat die Zukunftsforschung und ihre Möglichkeiten für sich noch nicht entdeckt. Die Logistikdienstleistungsbranche liegt im Bereich der Zukunftsforschung deutlich hinter der Pharma-, Automobil- und Telekommunikationsbranche, die die langfristige Zukunft ihrer Branchen schon seit vielen Jahren sehr systematisch analysieren, um Veränderungen zu antizipieren und Wettbewerbsvorteile zu erzielen (Darkow, von der Gracht, 2006). Warum sollte dies nicht auch in der Logistikdienstleistung möglich sein? Das Supply Management Institute (SMI) und die FutureManagementGroup AG haben aus diesem Anlass eine Studie zur Zukunft der Logistikdienstleistungsbranche in Deutschland 2025 durchgeführt, die im Februar 2008 gemeinsam mit der Bundesvereinigung Logistik (BVL) veröffentlicht wurde (Von der Gracht et al., 2008). Mit diesem Projekt sollen die Bedeutung und Möglichkeiten der Zukunftsforschung in der Logistik herausgestellt und ein weiter Blick in die Zukunft geworfen werden.(1)

Cxcl16 interact with SARS-CoV N protein in and out cell

Our study investigated the host cell protein which can interact with SARS-CoV N protein, and explored the functional connections. The eukaryotic expression vectors pEGFP-N1/SARS-CoVN and pdsRed2-N1/CXCL16 were constructed and used to co-transfect HEK293FT cells by the calcium phosphate method. The HIS-tagged fusion protein SARS-CoVN-GFP was then built and purified for the binding assay in vitro. The co-localization of SARS-CoVN and CXCL16 in the cytoplasm of HEK293FT cells was also shown using confocal laser scanning microscopy. It is suggested that their interaction might be through direct combination. Under a fluorescence microscope, it was observed that the purified fusion protein SARS-CoVN-GFP was attached to the cell membrane of CXCL16-transfected cells, indicating that SARS-CoVN and CXCL16 can be mutually combined.

Diffuse Lung Disease

Diffuse lung disease (DLD) comprises a diverse group of disorders characterized by widespread pulmonary parenchymal pathology and impaired gas exchange. While many of these disorders are categorized under the rubric of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of these disorders involve the airspaces or peripheral airways in addition to, or rather than, the interstitium. Some of these disorders are present primarily in infancy or early childhood, while others that are prevalent in adulthood rarely occur in childhood. This chapter will review the classification of pediatric DLD and the characteristic imaging findings of specific disorders to facilitate accurate diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment of children with these disorders.

Impact of Regulatory Changes on Pharmacist Delivered Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic

Summary: The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has created a dramatic need for the rapid implementation of telehealth services in areas of the country where telehealth is limited in scope.1 This implementation would not be possible without significant changes in how the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provide reimbursement for these services. In this brief review we intend to evaluate what regulatory changes have occurred, the impact of these changes, and additional opportunities for outpatient pharmacists to receive compensation while providing distant healthcare.

Mouse Hepatitis Virus Receptor as a Determinant of the Mouse Susceptibility to MHV Infection

In this review, we report that the receptor of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), is an important determinant of mouse susceptibility to MHV infection. This finding was revealed by using mouse strains with two different allelic forms of the MHV receptor, Ceacam1a and Ceacam1b. Although previous studies indicated that susceptibility is determined by a single gene, Ceacam1, our recent work in gene-replaced mice with chimeric Ceacam1 pointed toward the involvement of other host factors (genes) in the susceptibility. Studies on mouse susceptibility to MHV, as well as the factors involved in their susceptibility, are overviewed.

Review on the global epidemiological situation and the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19

Covid-19 disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a virus belonging to the coronavirus family. Covid-19 is so new that there is currently no specific vaccine or treatment. Clinical trials are currently underway. In vitro tests are also being conducted to assess the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of this epidemic, which is considered a pandemic by the WHO. We note that the content of this review is dated. The information it contains is subject to change and modification as the epidemic progresses.

Two Rare Cases of Posttraumatic Peripheral Artery Pseudoaneurysm.

Posttraumatic pseudoaneurysms of the lower limb are increasingly recognized due to the development of cross-sectional imaging. Two cases of anterior tibial artery pseudoaneurysm after blunt trauma are presented. The diagnostic technique of choice is Doppler ultrasound (US). In some cases, computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is needed to identify the feeding vessel. The treatment of choice is not yet determined. Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection is widely used as first-line treatment, but some cases are refractory to this treatment. Further investigation and optimization of therapeutic technique to definitely exclude the pseudoaneurysm from the circulation may result in faster and more cost-effective treatment than US-guided thrombin injection.

Faecal viruses of dogs — an electron microscope study

Abstract Faecal samples from 112 dogs both with and without diarrhoea were screened for parvovirus by a haemagglutination titration test and then examined by electron microscopy for the presence of viruses and virus-like particles. On the basis of morphology eight distinct viruses or virus-like particles were identified. Particles identified were coronaviruses, coronavirus-like particles, rotavirus-like particles, papovavirus-like particles, torovirus-like particles, picornavirus-like particles, 27 nm virus-like particles with projections and parvovirus-like particles which did not cause haemagglutination.

Parametric Learning of Associative Functional Networks Through a Modified Memetic Self-adaptive Firefly Algorithm

Functional networks are a powerful extension of neural networks where the scalar weights are replaced by neural functions. This paper concerns the problem of parametric learning of the associative model, a functional network that represents the associativity operator. This problem can be formulated as a nonlinear continuous least-squares minimization problem, solved by applying a swarm intelligence approach based on a modified memetic self-adaptive version of the firefly algorithm. The performance of our approach is discussed through an illustrative example. It shows that our method can be successfully applied to solve the parametric learning of functional networks with unknown functions.

QA-NIZK Arguments of Same Opening for Bilateral Commitments

Zero-knowledge proofs of satisfiability of linear equations over a group are often used as a building block of more complex protocols. In particular, in an asymmetric bilinear group we often have two commitments in different sides of the pairing, and we want to prove that they open to the same value. This problem was tackled by González, Hevia and Ràfols (ASIACRYPT 2015), who presented an aggregated proof, in the QA-NIZK setting, consisting of only four group elements. In this work, we present a more efficient proof, which is based on the same assumptions and consists of three group elements. We argue that our construction is optimal in terms of proof size.

On the Fine Grained Complexity of Finite Automata Non-emptiness of Intersection

We study the fine grained complexity of the DFA non-emptiness of intersection problem parameterized by the number k of input automata (k -DFA-NEI). More specifically, we are given a list [Formula: see text] of DFA’s over a common alphabet [Formula: see text], and the goal is to determine whether [Formula: see text]. This problem can be solved in time [Formula: see text] by applying the classic Rabin-Scott product construction. In this work, we show that the existence of algorithms solving k -DFA-NEI in time slightly faster than [Formula: see text] would imply the existence of deterministic sub-exponential time algorithms for the simulation of nondeterministic linear space bounded computations. This consequence strengthens the existing conditional lower bounds for k-DFA-NEI and implies new non-uniform circuit lower bounds.

Treating femoropopliteal disease: established and emerging technologies.

The femoropopliteal artery is the most common site of disease in patients with peripheral arterial disease and presents some of the greatest challenges for interventional radiology. Many patients can be managed with medical treatment combined with supervised exercise alone. However, a significant proportion, especially those suffering from severe intermittent claudication or critical limb ischemia, will require some form of endovascular or surgical revascularization procedure. During the past few years an endovascular-first approach has gained support from all vascular specialties. Today, even complex lesions can be treated successfully with an endovascular approach. Unfortunately, the unique bio-mechanical properties of this vascular segment have limited long-term patency rates and clinical value of the endovascular options. In this review, the authors discuss the methods and techniques for treatment of femoropopliteal lesions and review the current evidence for commercially available devices on patency outcomes following successful recanalization.

[Exploration of fire needling therapy on coronavirus disease 2019]

Combined with previous clinical experience in anti-epidemic and acupuncture, the prevention program of fire needling therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was drawn out. Fire needling therapy has the effects of clearing heat, removing dampness, replenishing for the deficiency, removing stasis and detoxifying, which is mainly aimed at preventing populations, light and common types cases, and cases in the recovery period. Acupoints of governor vessel, lung meridian, bladder meridian and stomach meridian are mainly used in this program. For the special groups, such as children, elderly and weak, and pregnant women, Shenzhu (GV 12), Danshu (BL 19), Geshu (BL 17), Zhigou (TE 6), etc. are added. It is hoped that fire needling therapy will be applied in the community and square cabin hospitals as an effective supplement to anti-epidemic of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).

Letter to the Editor "COVID-19 and Neurosurgical Education in Africa: Making Lemonade from Lemons"

Never in history has the fabric of African neurosurgery been challenged as it is today with the advent of the novel coronavirus identified in 2019 (COVID-19). Even the most robust and resilient neurosurgical educational systems in the continent have been brought to their knees with neurosurgical trainees and young neurosurgeons bearing the brunt. In the face of this new reality, and in order to limit the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, multiple programs have implemented physical distancing to reduce in-person interactions. In some cases, residents have been asked to stay home at least until they are instructed otherwise. This unfortunate event presents an innovative opportunity for neurosurgical education in Africa. Herein, we detail the framework of an online neurosurgical education initiative to advance the education of African residents and young neurosurgeons during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recomendaciones sobre el tratamiento antitrombótico durante la pandemia COVID-19. Posicionamiento del Grupo de Trabajo de Trombosis Cardiovascular de la Sociedad Española de Cardiología

Abstract The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which gives rise to the highly contagious COVID-19 disease, has caused a pandemic that is overwhelming health care systems worldwide. Affected patients have been reported to have a heightened inflammatory state that increases their thrombotic risk. However, there is very scarce information on the management of thrombotic risk, coagulation disorders, and anticoagulant therapy. In addition, the situation has also greatly influenced usual care in patients not infected with COVID-19. This article by the Working Group on Cardiovascular Thrombosis of the Spanish Society of Cardiology aims to summarize the available information and to provide a practical approach to the management of antithrombotic therapy.

Susceptibility of ferrets, cats, dogs, and other domesticated animals to SARS-coronavirus 2

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the infectious disease COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), which was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Despite extensive efforts to control the disease, COVID-19 has now spread to more than 100 countries and caused a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in bats; however, the intermediate animal sources of the virus are unknown. In this study, we investigated the susceptibility of ferrets and animals in close contact with humans to SARS-CoV-2. We found that SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks, but ferrets and cats are permissive to infection. Additionally, cats are susceptible to airborne transmission. Our study provides insights into the animal models for SARS-CoV-2 and animal management for COVID-19 control.

Encouraging rational antibiotic use in childhood pneumonia: a focus on Vietnam and the Western Pacific Region

Globally, pneumonia is considered to be the biggest killer of infants and young children (aged <5 years) outside the neonatal period, with the greatest disease burden in low- and middle-income countries. Optimal management of childhood pneumonia is challenging in settings where clinicians have limited information regarding the local pathogen and drug resistance profiles. This frequently results in unnecessary and poorly targeted antibiotic use. Restricting antibiotic use is a global priority, particularly in Asia and the Western Pacific Region where excessive use is driving high rates of antimicrobial resistance. The authors conducted a comprehensive literature review to explore the antibiotic resistance profile of bacteria associated with pneumonia in the Western Pacific Region, with a focus on Vietnam. Current management practices were also considered, along with the diagnostic dilemmas faced by doctors and other factors that increase unnecessary antibiotic use. This review offers some suggestions on how these issues may be addressed.

The Perfect Moral Storm: Diverse Ethical Considerations in the COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has both exposed and created deep rifts in society. It has thrust us into deep ethical thinking to help justify the difficult decisions many will be called upon to make and to protect from decisions that lack ethical underpinnings. This paper aims to highlight ethical issues in six different areas of life highlighting the enormity of the task we are faced with globally. In the context of COVID-19, we consider health inequity, dilemmas in triage and allocation of scarce resources, ethical issues associated with research, ethical considerations relating to tracing apps, and exit strategies such as immunity passports and COVID-19 vaccines. Finally, we consider environmental issues in light of COVID-19. The paper also offers some ethical reflection on these areas as many parts of the world contemplate the recovery phase.

Canine and Feline Blood Donor Screening for Infectious Disease

Consensus Statements of the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) provide veterinarians with guidelines regarding the pathophysiology, diagnosis, or treatment of animal diseases. The foundation of the Consensus Statement is evidence‐based medicine, but if such evidence is conflicting or lacking, the panel provides interpretive recommendations on the basis of their collective expertise. The Consensus Statement is intended to be a guide for veterinarians, but it is not a statement of standard of care or a substitute for clinical judgment. Topics of statements and panel members to draft the statements are selected by the Board of Regents with input from the general membership. A draft prepared and input from Diplomates is solicited at the Forum and via the ACVIM Web site and incorporated in a final version. This Consensus Statement was approved by the Board of Regents of the ACVIM before publication.

Adapted protocol for pulse oximetry screening for congenital heart defects in a country with homebirths.

UNLABELLED Pulse oximetry has been recommended for neonatal screening for critical congenital heart defects (CCHD) and is now performed in several countries where most births take place in hospital. However, there is a wide variation in perinatal care in European countries, and studies are now recommended to determine the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of CCHD screening in individual countries. In the Netherlands, a large part of births are supervised by a community-based midwife, at home or at policlinics. A screening protocol has been developed to fit into the Dutch perinatal setting, and also has the potential to increase safety in homebirths. CONCLUSION the provided protocol might be useful for other countries that are planning to implement CCHD screening after homebirths or early discharge from hospital.

Coronavirus: Where Has All the Health Economics Gone?

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to unfold there is an untold number of trade-offs being made in every country around the globe. The experience in the United Kingdom and Canada to date has not seen much uptake of health economics methods. We provide some thoughts on how this could take place, specifically in three areas. Firstly, this can involve understanding the impact of lockdown policies on national productivity. Secondly, there is great importance in studying trade-offs with respect to enhancing health system capacity and the impact of the mix of private-public financing. Finally, there are key trade-offs that will continue to be made both in terms of access to testing and ventilators which would benefit greatly from economic appraisal. In short, health economics could - and we would argue most certainly should - play a much more prominent role in policy-making as it relates to the current as well as future pandemics.

[A Case of Aortitis Caused by a Granulocyte-Colony-Stimulating Factor during Chemotherapy for Pancreatic Cancer].

BACKGROUND Pegfilgrastim, a long-acting granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor(G-CSF), has been used as prophylaxis for severe hematotoxicity induced by chemotherapy. We report a case of aortitis induced by pegfilgrastim administration during modified FOLFIRINOX(mFOLFIRINOX)chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer. CASE REPORT A 65-year-old woman underwent a distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic tail cancer. Liver metastases appeared 2 years after the surgery. mFOLFIRINOX chemotherapy was started with prophylactic administration of pegfilgrastim. Eight days after the first administration and 6 days after administration of the 8th course, the patient developed a fever. The blood test results indicated severe inflammation. Computed tomography revealed a thickened aorta indicating aortitis. The symptoms rapidly improved with antibiotic therapy. We diagnosed aortitis induced by pegfilgrastim administration. CONCLUSION Aortitis should be considered when a patient has unidentified inflammatory findings after receiving pegfilgrastim.

An intelligent system for predicting and preventing MERS-CoV infection outbreak

MERS-CoV is an airborne disease which spreads easily and has high death rate. To predict and prevent MERS-CoV, real-time analysis of user’s health data and his/her geographic location are fundamental. Development of healthcare systems using cloud computing is emerging as an effective solution having benefits of better quality of service, reduced cost, scalability, and flexibility. In this paper, an effective cloud computing system is proposed which predicts MERS-CoV-infected patients using Bayesian belief network and provides geographic-based risk assessment to control its outbreak. The proposed system is tested on synthetic data generated for 0.2 million users. System provided high accuracy for classification and appropriate geographic-based risk assessment. The key point of this paper is the use of geographic positioning system to represent each MERS-CoV users on Google maps so that possibly infected users can be quarantined as early as possible. It will help uninfected citizens to avoid regional exposure and the government agencies to manage the problem more effectively.

Characterization of influenza A virus pseudotyped with the spike protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus

The coronavirus spike protein and the influenza virus hemagglutinin are class I viral membrane fusion proteins. While the two proteins display strong structural conservation and the mechanisms underlying membrane fusion are similar, they share no sequence similarity. Whether they are functionally interchangeable is currently unknown. In this study, we constructed scIAV-S, a single-cycle influenza A virus pseudotyped with the spike protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and demonstrated that this virus could infect cultured cells and trigger massive syncytium formation. Treatment with endocytosis inhibitors did not affect syncytium formation by infected cells. Moreover, the infectivity of scIAV-S was associated with the degree of cell adaptation of PEDV-S. Intriguingly, scIAV-S lacking functional neuraminidase (NA) exhibited substantially higher infectivity, suggesting a pivotal role of the sialic acid in the binding/entry of PEDV. Together, scIAV-S offers a robust platform for the investigation of the entry mechanism of PEDV or, possibly, of other coronaviruses.

Global health surveillance.

Awareness of the importance of global health surveillance increased in the latter part of the 20th century with the global emergence of human immunodeficiency virus and novel strains of influenza. In the first decade of the 21st century, several events further highlighted global shared interests in and vulnerability to infectious diseases. Bioterrorist use of anthrax spores in 2001 raised awareness of the value of public health surveillance for national security. The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, re-emergence of a panzootic of avian influenza A H5N1 in 2005, and the sudden emergence of pandemic H1N1 in North America in 2009 all highlighted the importance of shared global responsibility for surveillance and disease control. In particular, in 2003, SARS precipitated changes in awareness of the world's collective economic vulnerability to epidemic shocks.

Disposable DNA Amplification Chips with Integrated Low-Cost Heaters †

Fast point-of-use detection of, for example, early-stage zoonoses, e.g., Q-fever, bovine tuberculosis, or the Covid-19 coronavirus, is beneficial for both humans and animal husbandry as it can save lives and livestock. The latter prevents farmers from going bankrupt after a zoonoses outbreak. This paper describes the development of a fabrication process and the proof-of-principle of a disposable DNA amplification chip with an integrated heater. Based on the analysis of the milling process, metal adhesion studies, and COMSOL MultiPhysics heat transfer simulations, the first batch of chips has been fabricated and successful multiple displacement amplification reactions are performed inside these chips. This research is the first step towards the development of an early-stage zoonoses detection device. Tests with real zoonoses and DNA specific amplification reactions still need to be done.

Smell and taste disorders during COVID‐19 outbreak: A cross‐sectional study on 355 patients

BACKGROUND: As reported by increasing literature, a significant number of patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection developed smell/taste disorders. Aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and severity of these symptoms among laboratory‐confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 patients. Secondary objective is to determine their onset/recovery time. METHODS: This cross‐sectional study was conducted from March 10 to 30, 2020 at Novara University Hospital during the COVID‐19 Italian outbreak. The 355 enrolled patients answered a questionnaire at 14th (or more) days after proven infection. RESULTS: The overall population prevalence of both smell/taste or one of the two disorders was 70%. They were first symptoms in 31 (8,7%) patients. Most patients reported a complete loss that in half of the cases (49.5%) was fully recovered after 14 days, with a median recovery time of 10 days. CONCLUSION: This study confirms a high prevalence of smell/taste disorders in COVID‐19 infection with self‐recovery for half cases after about 2 weeks.

Sequence and organization of barley yellow dwarf virus genomic RNA.

The nucleotide sequence of the genomic RNA of barley yellow dwarf virus, PAV serotype was determined, except for the 5'-terminal base, and its genome organization deduced. The 5,677 nucleotide genome contains five large open reading frames (ORFs). The genes for the coat protein (1) and the putative viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were identified. The latter shows a striking degree of similarity to that of carnation mottle virus (CarMV). By comparison with corona- and retrovirus RNAs, it is proposed that a translational frameshift is involved in expression of the polymerase. An ORF encoding an Mr 49,797 protein (50K ORF) may be translated by in-frame readthrough of the coat protein stop codon. The coat protein, an overlapping 17K ORF, and a 3'6.7K ORF are likely to be expressed via subgenomic mRNAs.

The influence of selenium and selenoproteins on immune responses of poultry and pigs

Abstract Selenium is an essential nutrient for poultry and pigs, and is important for a number of physiological processes including regulation and function of the immune system. Through its incorporation into selenoproteins, Se is involved in the regulation of oxidative stress, redox mechanisms, and other crucial cellular processes involved in innate and adaptive immune response. This review provides current knowledge on the mechanisms by which selenium can modulate the resilience to infectious diseases, and how this micronutrient can influence the capacity of the bird or the pig to maintain its productivity during an infectious challenge. In relation to the most frequent and economically important infectious diseases in poultry and pig production, the present paper considers the influence of different selenium sources (organic vs. inorganic Se) as well as dietary concentrations on the immune responses of poultry and pigs with major emphasis on the potential beneficial impact on animal resilience to common infectious diseases.

A critical review on serine protease: Key immune manipulator and pathology mediator

Proteolytic activity is fundamental to survival, so it is not surprising that all living organisms have proteases, especially seine protease. This enzyme in its numerous isoforms and homologues, constitutes the quintessential offence and defence factors, in the form of surface proteins, secreted molecules, gut digestive enzymes, venom in specialised glands or plant latex, among other manifestations. Occurring as trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, collagenase, thrombin, subtilisin etc., it mediates a diverse array of functions, including pathological roles as inflammatory, coagulatory to haemorrhagic. This review emphasizes that despite the superficial differences in mechanisms, most health issues, be they infectious, allergic, metabolic, or neural have a common conduit. This enzyme, in its various glycosylated forms leads to signal misinterpretations, wreaking havoc. However, organisms are endowed with serine protease inhibitors which might restrain this ubiquitous yet deleterious enzyme. Hence, serine proteases-driven pathogenesis and antagonising role of inhibitors is the focal point of this critical review.

Sources and mechanisms of bioaerosol generation in occupational environments.

The primary purpose of this study was to critically review published data related to the sources and mechanisms of aerosolization of microorganisms, their fragments and metabolites in a variety of occupational environments. The processes and mechanisms considered in the review include bursting bubbles; liquid dispersion as the result of irrigation, separation, high pressure cleaning and technological water recycling; manual and automated handling of contaminated material in agriculture, waste processing and industrial processes; as well as high temperature industrial processes. The review identifies the gaps in the existing knowledge regarding the sources of bioaerosol, aerosolization mechanisms, bioaerosol distribution and potential risks for the workers and residents. The study also reviews the existing laboratory methods of bioaerosol generation with particular focus on the advantages and shortcomings of each method.

Bedeutung der Hornhautorgankultur bei Spendern mit möglicher SARS-CoV-2-Infektion./ [Importance of corneal organ culture in donors with possible SARS-CoV-2 infections]

The appearance of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV­2) poses challenges in ophthalmology particularly for eye banks. A valid risk assessment for the removal and processing of donor corneas is difficult due to the lack of data. The risk to infect transplant recipients with SARS-CoV­2 still appears very unlikely due to the experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome -coronavirus(­1) (SARS-CoV(­1)) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV); however, due to the occurrence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the cornea an infection of this tissue with SARS-CoV­2 cannot be completely excluded. Therefore, routine testing of the organ culture medium used for donor corneas for SARS-CoV­2 prior to transplantation during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID­19) pandemic should be considered.

Risk factors for pandemic H1N1 2009 infection in healthcare personnel of four general hospitals

Summary To characterize an outbreak of pandemic H1N1 2009 among healthcare personnel (HCP), we conducted a cross-sectional survey of HCP who had worked in four general hospitals during the outbreak. More than one-quarter of responding HCP (27.6%) had influenza-like illness (ILI) during the outbreak. The estimated infection rate of pandemic H1N1 2009 was 9.1% in the study of HCP. Independent risk factors for ILI were female gender, <40 years of age, the presence of chronic diseases associated with influenza complications, having family members with ILI or pandemic H1N1 2009, and working in influenza outpatient, influenza inpatient, non-influenza outpatient or emergency departments. During the outbreak of pandemic H1N1 2009, HCP frequently had ILI or the influenza infection. The development of the influenza infection in HCP was associated with some of their baseline characteristics, occupational risk factors, and non-occupational ones during the outbreak.

Severe COVID-19 in a renal transplant recipient: A focus on pharmacokinetics

The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires extra attention for immunocompromised patients, including solid organ transplant recipients. We report on a case of a 35-year-old renal transplant recipient who suffered from a severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The clinical course was complicated by extreme overexposure to the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus, following coadministration of chloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir therapy. The case is illustrative for dilemmas that transplant professionals may face in the absence of evidence-based COVID-19 therapy and concurrent pressure for exploration of experimental pharmacological treatment options. However, the risk-benefit balance of experimental or off-label therapy may be weighed differently in organ transplant recipients than in otherwise healthy COVID-19 patients, owing to their immunocompromised status and potential drug interactions with immunosuppressive therapy. With this case report, we aimed to achieve increased awareness and improved management of drug-drug interactions associated with the various treatment options for COVID-19 in renal transplant patients.

Proteogenomics analysis unveils a TFG-RET gene fusion and druggable targets in papillary thyroid carcinomas

Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most common type of endocrine malignancy. By RNA-seq analysis, we identify a RET rearrangement in the tumour material of a patient who does not harbour any known RAS or BRAF mutations. This new gene fusion involves exons 1-4 from the 5' end of the Trk fused Gene (TFG) fused to the 3' end of RET tyrosine kinase leading to a TFG-RET fusion which transforms immortalized human thyroid cells in a kinase-dependent manner. TFG-RET oligomerises in a PB1 domain-dependent manner and oligomerisation of TFG-RET is required for oncogenic transformation. Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals the upregulation of E3 Ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 and DUBs like USP9X and UBP7 in both tumor and metastatic lesions, which is further confirmed in additional patients. Expression of TFG-RET leads to the upregulation of HUWE1 and inhibition of HUWE1 significantly reduces RET-mediated oncogenesis.

Neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19 presenting with an acute manic episode

A 41-year-old man with no significant medical history presented with acute behavioural disruption on the background of a 1-day history of severe headache and a 10-day history of dry cough and fever. He was sexually disinhibited with pressured speech and grandiose ideas. His behaviour worsened, necessitating heavy sedation and transfer to intensive care for mechanical ventilation despite no respiratory indication. Investigations confirmed that he was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Neuroimaging and a lumbar puncture were normal. Initial screening for SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid was negative although no validated assay was available. The patient’s mental state remained abnormal following stepdown from intensive care. Psychiatric assessment found features consistent with acute mania, and he was detained under the Mental Health Act. This case indicates the need to consider COVID-19 in a wider series of clinical presentations and to develop a validated assay for SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid.

The suture retention test, revisited and revised.

A systematic investigation of the factors affecting the suture retention test is performed. The specimen width w and the distance a of the suture bite from the specimen free edge emerge as the most influential geometrical parameters. A conservative approach for the quantification of suture retention strength is identified, based on the use of a camera to monitor the incipient failure and detect the instant of earliest crack propagation. The corresponding critical force, called break starting strength, is extremely robust against test parameter variations and its dependence on the specimen geometry becomes negligible when a≥ 2mm and w≥ 10mm. Comparison of suture retention and mode I crack opening tests reveals a linear correlation between break starting strength and tearing energy. This suggests that the defect created by the needle and the load applied by the suture thread lead to a fracture mechanics problem, which dominates the initiation of failure.

Drug targets for COVID-19 therapeutics: Ongoing global efforts

The current global pandemic COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has already inflicted insurmountable damage both to the human lives and global economy. There is an immediate need for identification of effective drugs to contain the disastrous virus outbreak. Global efforts are already underway at a war footing to identify the best drug combination to address the disease. In this review, an attempt has been made to understand the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, and based on this information potential druggable targets against SARS-CoV-2 are summarized. Also, the strategies for ongoing and future drug discovery against the SARS-CoV-2 virus are outlined. Given the urgency to find a definitive cure, ongoing drug repurposing efforts being carried out by various organizations are also described. The unprecedented crisis requires extraordinary efforts from the scientific community to effectively address the issue and prevent further loss of human lives and health.

Strongly Stable and Maximum Weakly Stable Noncrossing Matchings

In IWOCA 2019, Ruangwises and Itoh introduced stable noncrossing matchings, where participants of each side are aligned on each of two parallel lines, and no two matching edges are allowed to cross each other. They defined two stability notions, strongly stable noncrossing matching (SSNM) and weakly stable noncrossing matching (WSNM), depending on the strength of blocking pairs. They proved that a WSNM always exists and presented an [Formula: see text]-time algorithm to find one for an instance with n men and n women. They also posed open questions of the complexities of determining existence of an SSNM and finding a largest WSNM. In this paper, we show that both problems are solvable in polynomial time. Our algorithms are applicable to extensions where preference lists may include ties, except for one case which we show to be NP-complete.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus replication and quasispecies evolution in pigs that lack adaptive immunity.

The replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was studied in a line of pigs possessing a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Real-time RT-PCR revealed a unique course of infection for the SCID group. During the course of infection, viremia was initially significantly lower than normal littermates, but by 21 days was significantly elevated. Deep sequencing of the viral structural genes at days 11 and 21 identified seven amino acid substitutions in both normal and SCID pigs. The most significant change was a W99R substitution in GP2, which was present in the inoculum at a frequency of 35%, but eventually disappeared from all pigs regardless of immune status. Therefore, amino acid substitutions that appear during acute infection are likely the result of the adaptation of the virus to replication in pigs and not immune selection.

LGP2 binds to PACT to regulate RIG-I- and MDA5-mediated antiviral responses.

The retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2 stimulate inflammatory and antiviral responses by sensing nonself RNA molecules produced during viral replication. Here, we investigated how LGP2 regulates the RIG-I- and MDA5-dependent induction of type I interferon (IFN) signaling and showed that LGP2 interacted with different components of the RNA-silencing machinery. We identified a direct protein-protein interaction between LGP2 and the IFN-inducible, double-stranded RNA binding protein PACT. The LGP2-PACT interaction was mediated by the regulatory C-terminal domain of LGP2 and was necessary for inhibiting RIG-I-dependent responses and for amplifying MDA5-dependent responses. We described a point mutation within LGP2 that disrupted the LGP2-PACT interaction and led to the loss of LGP2-mediated regulation of RIG-I and MDA5 signaling. These results suggest a model in which the LGP2-PACT interaction regulates the inflammatory responses mediated by RIG-I and MDA5 and enables the cellular RNA-silencing machinery to coordinate with the innate immune response.

Ebola in West Africa.

Ebola viral disease (EVD) is a severe and life-threatening disease. The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa entered its second year and is unprecedented because it is the largest one in history, involved urban centers and affected a large number of health care workers. It quickly escalated from medical into a humanitarian, social, economic, and security crisis. The primary pillars to prevent EVD are: early diagnosis, isolation of patients, contact tracing and monitoring, safe burials, infection prevention and control and social mobilization. The implementation of all these components was challenged in the field. Key lessons from this Ebola outbreak are that countries with weak health care systems can't withstand the major outbreaks; preparedness to treat the first confirmed cases is a national emergency; all control measures must be coordinated together and community engagement is the great factor to combat this disease.

Development of Animal Models Against Emerging Coronaviruses: From SARS to MERS coronavirus

Two novel coronaviruses have emerged to cause severe disease in humans. While bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) likely crossed into humans from civets in China, and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East. Unlike SARS-CoV that resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going public health threat. Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures against emerging viruses. With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive to infection. In contrast, most laboratory animals are refractory or only semi-permissive to infection with MERS-CoV. This host-range restriction is largely determined by sequence heterogeneity in the MERS-CoV receptor. We describe animal models developed to study coronaviruses, with a focus on host-range restriction at the level of the viral receptor and discuss approaches to consider in developing a model to evaluate countermeasures against MERS-CoV.

Interventional therapy for hypertension: Back on track again?

Treatment-resistant hypertension, or resistant hypertension, is defined as blood pressure that remains above target despite concurrent use of at least three antihypertensive agents from different classes at optimal doses, one of which should be a diuretic. Important considerations in the diagnosis of treatment-resistant hypertension include the exclusion of pseudoresistance and the evaluation of potential secondary causes of hypertension and of concomitant conditions that maintain high blood pressure. The ability to diagnose true treatment-resistant hypertension is important for selection of patients who may be appropriately treated with an invasive therapy. Currently, there are three interventional approaches to treat resistant hypertension, namely: (1) reduction of the activity of the sympathetic nervous system by renal nerve ablation, (2) stimulation of baroreceptors and (3) creation of a peripheral arterial venous anastomosis. This review focuses on the rationale behind these invasive approaches and the clinical results.

Infections with Viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae during Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis

The association of viral and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis was studied by serologic or isolation techniques in 46 adult men during the five years from 1964 through 1968. Serologic evidence of viral or M. pneumoniae infection was detected in 25% of 166 episodes of exacerbation and 14% of 138 remission periods (P = 0.02). Influenza A virus, parainfluenza virus type 3, and coronavirus OC43 predominated; infections with other viruses were infrequent. Infection with M. pneumoniae was detected serologically in four patients, but this organism was never isolated from sputum specimens. Rhinoviruses were isolated from frozen-stored sputum specimens in 2.7% of the episodes of exacerbation and from 0.55% of the remission intervals (P not significant). These data suggest that although exacerbations of chronic bronchitis may be accompanied by viral and M. pneumoniae infections, patients with chronic bronchitis also acquire such infections without a worsening of their respiratory status.

Successful tracheal intubation using fiberoptic bronchoscope via an I-gel™ supraglottic airway in a pediatric patient with Goldenhar syndrome -A case report-.

The I-gel™ is a single-use supraglottic airway device introduced in 2007 which features a non-inflatable cuff and allows passage of a tracheal tube owing to its large diameter and short length of the airway tube. In this case, the authors experienced a difficult airway management on a 4-year-old boy with underlying Goldenhar syndrome who underwent a tonsillectomy. Intubation using a laryngoscope was unsuccessful at the first attempt. In the following attempt, we used the I-gel™ supraglottic airway for ventilation and were able to achieve successful intubation with a cuffed tube by using fiberoptic bronchoscope through the I-gel™ supraglottic airway. The authors suggest that I-gel™ is a useful device for ventilation and it has many advantages for tracheal intubation in pediatric patients with difficult airway.

History of Disaster Epidemiology: 1960–2015

Disaster epidemiology is not a new field, and the methods utilized to conduct disaster epidemiology studies are no different than the methods used in everyday applied public health research and investigations. The only difference is the circumstances under which the methods are employed. The challenges of conducting epidemiologic studies during a disaster are many—limited access to study sites and populations; access to reliable electricity, connectivity, and communication systems; and typically a short time frame in which to gather, analyze, and report data to decision-makers so that it can be utilized to prevent morbidity and mortality. However, many innovations have been developed by disaster epidemiologists to meet these challenges. Rapid needs assessments, innovative surveillance and tracking systems, and adapted epidemiologic study designs are some of the innovations that will be discussed in this chapter.

Collateral damage of COVID-19 pandemic: Delayed medical care

During the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency room visits have drastically decreased for non-COVID conditions such as appendicitis, heart attack, and stroke. Patients may be avoiding seeking medical attention for fear of catching the deadly condition or as an unintended consequence of stay-at-home orders. This delay in seeking care can lead to increased morbidity and mortality, which has not been figured in the assessment of the extent of damage caused by this pandemic. This case illustrates an example of "collateral damage" caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. What would have been a standard ST-elevation myocardial infarction treated with timely and successful stenting of a dominant right coronary artery occlusion, became a much more dangerous postinfarction ventricular septal defect; all because of a 2-day delay in seeking medical attention by an unsuspecting patient.

Translational recoding signals: Expanding the synthetic biology toolbox.

Innovation follows discovery. If the 20th century was a golden age of discovery in the biomolecular biosciences, the current century may be remembered by the explosion of beneficial devices and therapies conceived by the bioengineers of the era. Much as the development of solid-state electronic components made possible the information revolution, the rational combining of millions of basic molecular control modules will enable the development of highly sophisticated biomachines that will make today's smartphones appear rudimentary. The molecular toolbox is already well-stocked, particularly in our ability to manipulate DNA, control transcription, generate functionally novel hybrid proteins, and expand the genetic code to include unnatural amino acids. This review focuses on how RNA-based regulatory modules that direct alternative readings of the genetic code can be employed as basic circuit components to expand our ability to control gene expression.

Towards a solution to MERS: protective human monoclonal antibodies targeting different domains and functions of the MERS-coronavirus spike glycoprotein

The Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus that causes severe and often fatal respiratory disease in humans. Efforts to develop antibody-based therapies have focused on neutralizing antibodies that target the receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein thereby blocking receptor binding. Here, we developed a set of human monoclonal antibodies that target functionally distinct domains of the MERS-CoV spike protein. These antibodies belong to six distinct epitope groups and interfere with the three critical entry functions of the MERS-CoV spike protein: sialic acid binding, receptor binding and membrane fusion. Passive immunization with potently as well as with poorly neutralizing antibodies protected mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge. Collectively, these antibodies offer new ways to gain humoral protection in humans against the emerging MERS-CoV by targeting different spike protein epitopes and functions.

The “Intubox”: Enhancing Frontline Healthcare Worker Safety During Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)

There has been a substantial burden of healthcare worker infection during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, likely due to a lack of adequate preparedness, suboptimal institutional infection control measures, atypical patient presentation, poor compliance with personal protective equipment (PPE) and exposure to high-risk aerosol generating procedures, such as endotracheal intubation. There is significant concern that developing countries will face heightened levels of staff exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate this exposure risk during procedures, such as endotracheal intubation, various “aerosol boxes” have been designed by frontline healthcare workers. However, in practice these boxes were found to hamper endotracheal intubation and other procedures due to the limited space and manoeuvrability they allow. To further reduce particle dispersion and to improve on the practicality and ergonomic design of the prototype “aerosol box”, the Intubox was developed by staff at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital after instituting several changes to the prototype design.

Group A Rotavirus Veterinary Vaccines

Group A rotaviruses cause diarrhea in young livestock and poultry; consequently, vaccination strategies have focused on induction of active or passive immunity. Gnotobiotic pigs and calves serve as useful models to evaluate induction of active immunity by candidate animal or human rotavirus vaccines. However, live attenuated rotavirus vaccines lacked efficacy when administered orally to calves and pigs in the field, presumably because colostral antibodies inhibited vaccine virus replication. The widespread occurrence of rotavirus antibodies in colostrum led to strategies for maternal rotavirus vaccination to boost lactogenic immunity and transfer passive antibodies to the neonate via colostrum and milk. The variable success of maternal rotavirus vaccines in the field is influenced by vaccine dose, strain, inactivating agent, adjuvant, route of administration, and environmental rotavirus exposure levels. The use of genetically engineered rotavirus-like particle vaccines in cows to boost antibodies in mammary secretions shows promise. Such subunit vaccines possess potential advantages over existing vaccines.

Next-Generation Sequencing and Its Application: Empowering in Public Health Beyond Reality

Next-generation sequencing has the ability to revolutionize almost all fields of biological science. It has drastically reduced the cost of sequencing. This allows us to study the whole genome or part of the genome to understand how the cellular functions are governed by the genetic code. The data obtained in huge quantity from sequencing upon analysis gives an insight to understand the mechanism of pathogen biology, virulence, and phenomenon of bacterial resistance, which helps in investigating the outbreak. This ultimately helps in the development of therapies for public health welfare against human pathogen and diagnostic reagents for the screening. This chapter includes the basic of Sanger’s method of DNA sequencing and next-generation sequencing, different available platforms for sequencing with their advantages, and limitations and their chemistry with an overview of downstream data analysis. Furthermore, the breadth of applications of high-throughput NGS technology for human health has been discussed.

Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ECs) and COVID-19: the perfect storm for young consumers

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a change in our society and put health systems in crisis worldwide. Different risk factors and comorbidities have been found that increase the risk of mortality when acquiring this infection. The use of alternative devices to the cigarette like the electronic cigarettes, the vapers have been studied widely and generators of great controversy since it has been discovered that they also produce different pulmonary affections. When developing the SARS-CoV2 infection, different theories have been generated about the greater predisposition to a worse prognosis of people who use electronic cigarettes; however, the information on this continues in discovery. A group of experts made up of oncologists, infectologists, pulmonologists, and epidemiologists met to review the literature and then generate theories about the impact of electronic cigarettes on SARS-CoV2 infection.

Heparanase, cell signaling, and viral infections

Heparanase (HPSE) is a multifunctional protein endowed with many non-enzymatic functions and a unique enzymatic activity as an endo-ß-D-glucuronidase. The latter allows it to serve as a key modulator of extracellular matrix (ECM) via a well-regulated cleavage of heparan sulfate side chains of proteoglycans at cell surfaces. The cleavage and associated changes at the ECM cause release of multiple signaling molecules with important cellular and pathological functions. New and emerging data suggest that both enzymatic as well as non-enzymatic functions of HPSE are important for health and illnesses including viral infections and virally induced cancers. This review summarizes recent findings on the roles of HPSE in activation, inhibition, or bioavailability of key signaling molecules such as AKT, VEGF, MAPK-ERK, and EGFR, which are known regulators of common viral infections in immune and non-immune cell types. Altogether, our review provides a unique overview of HPSE in cell-survival signaling pathways and how they relate to viral infections.

Can graphene take part in the fight against COVID-19?

Abstract The pneumonia outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a global issue. The bidimensional material graphene has captured much attention due to promising antimicrobial applications and has also demonstrated antiviral efficacy. In response to this global outbreak, we summarized the current state of knowledge of graphene and virus interaction as well as possible successful applications to fight COVID-19. Antibody-conjugated graphene sheets can rapidly detect targeted virus proteins and can be useful for large population screening, but also for the development of environmental sensors and filters, given the low cost of graphene materials. The functionalized graphene has demonstrated a good viral capture capacity that, combined with heat or light-mediated inactivation, could be used as a disinfectant. Graphene sensors arrays can be implemented on standard utility textiles and drug efficacy screening. Thanks to its high versatility, we foresee that graphene may have a leading role in the fight against COVID-19.

[Gymnastics-sports activities: health benefits in emergency period CoViD-19. How to organize a quick shot.]

Regular physical activity grants significant health effects and lowers the risk of premature death for all causes, in particular cardiovascular ones in asymptomatic subjects. Physical activity is useful in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular and lung diseases, metabolic diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, cancer and depression. Recent studies correlate inactivity with chronic low-grade inflammation and obesity, at the origin of chronic non-communicable diseases. The evidence must be taken seriously into consideration in this particular CoViD-19 emergency period and long-term effects of prolonged limitation of sports activity must not be overlooked. Contagion in open places is very difficult and the absolute prohibition of sports activities in open places and the closure of parks are creating discomfort and confusion. Institutions and media are generating the wrong message that active people must be looked at with disapproval. Instead, this habit should be encouraged, in order to protect citizens' and community health, lightening the welfare load for society.

Bioinformatics in Design of Antiviral Vaccines

Abstract Viral diseases and epidemics are occurring across the world with increasing frequency and with incidences of new and old viruses with renewed vigor. Traditional drugs and vaccines with their long developmental times, incidences of allergenic reactions, growth of resistant strains and other issues are proving inadequate to curb the menace. Advancements in computer science and technology, in genetics and immunology and the growth of the new science of bioinformatics are leading to a more focused approach in a new paradigm of vaccine design that challenges the traditional approach and promises to be more effective; lead times should get much shorter, preselection of peptide antivirals will be designed to preclude allergenic reactions, stability against mutational changes to viral strains will be much more assured, and coverage of immunological status will enable community-specific vaccines development. We outline in this article the basics of viruses, immune responses, and traditional vaccines and move on to describe the bioinformatics methods and development of new vaccines.

Family Life Education for Families Facing Acute Stress: Best Practices and Recommendations

Acute family stress in this article is defined as the sudden or unexpected onset of moderate to severe discomfort or disequilibrium and feeling of inadequacy among family members in light of perceived insufficient available resources. Historically, there has been some ambivalence about stress—especially acute stress—and family life education. More recently, authors have suggested that the important issue determining appropriateness is not the topic but the approach used by the professionals. Several approaches are presented here that have been used by professionals to help children and families dealing with acute stress. They include care for self, identify acute stress, support caregivers and central figures in social networks, help families understand stress and coping, help adults talk with children, connect families with the familiar, collaborate with other professionals, and advocate for families.

Microarrays and microneedle arrays for delivery of peptides, proteins, vaccines and other applications.

INTRODUCTION Peptide and protein microarray and microneedle array technology provides direct information on protein function and potential drug targets in drug discovery and delivery. Because of this unique ability, these arrays are well suited for protein profiling, drug target identification/validation and studies of protein interaction, biochemical activity, immune responses, clinical prognosis and diagnosis and for gene, protein and drug delivery. AREAS COVERED The aim of this review is to describe and summarize past and recent developments of microarrays in their construction, characterization and production and applications of microneedles in drug delivery. The scope and limitations of various technologies in this respect are discussed. EXPERT OPINION This article offers a review of microarray/microneedle technologies and possible future directions in targeting and in the delivery of pharmacologically active compounds for unmet needs in biopharmaceutical research. A better understanding of the production and use of microarrays and microneedles for delivery of peptides, proteins and vaccines is needed.

Revisiting oil-stock nexus during COVID-19 pandemic: Some preliminary results

Abstract We provide some preliminary estimates about the behaviour of oil-stock nexus during COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, we conduct distinct analyses for periods before and after the announcement of the pandemic. A panel Vector Autoregressive (pVAR) model is constructed to analyse the response of oil and stocks to shocks. A panel Logit model is also formulated to evaluate the probability of having negative oil price and stock returns between the two data samples. The pVAR analyses suggest that both oil and stock markets may experience greater initial and prolonged impacts of own and cross shocks during the pandemic than the period before it. This outcome is further corroborated by the panel Logit estimates suggesting that the probability of having negative oil and stock returns during the pandemic may be due uncertainty associated with the relevant markets.

[Antiviral activity of arbidol and its derivatives against the pathogen of severe acute respiratory syndrome in the cell cultures].

Experimental studies of arbidol and arbidol mesylate versus ribavirin suggest that insertion of these agents into the nutrient medium of the cultured cells GMK-AH-1 (D) after infection at concentrations of 50, 25, and 100 microg/ml, respectively, is effective in suppressing the reproduction of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus. Arbidol and arbidol mesylate were shown to have a direct antiviral effect in early viral replication in the cultured cells. The promising antiviral agent is arbidol mesylate that is nearly 5 times as effective as arbidol in reducing the reproduction of SARS virus in the cultured cells. Insertion of arbidol, arbidol mesylate, and ribavirin into the nutrient medium 2 hours after infection of porcine embryonic renal cells caused a reduction in the accumulation of the pathogen by 2.5, 2.1, and 2.6 Ig, respectively.

Relative Energy Expenditure Decreases during the First Year after Bariatric Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

The effect of bariatric surgery on resting energy expenditure (REE) remains unclear, particularly in terms of the REE/fat-free mass (FFM) ratio. We performed a systematic review with a meta-analysis on Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) studies to investigate the effect of bariatric surgery on the REE/FFM ratio 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Five of the 13 records of 6-month data (n = 406) showed a reduction in the REE/FFM ratio without significant summary effects. As regards 12-month data (10 records, n = 713), there was a significant relative REE mean reduction of 1.95 kcal/kg in FFM (CI: -2.82 to -1.09; I2 = 28%; p < 0.00001). These findings suggest that bariatric surgery, specifically RYGB, leads to a decrease in the REE/FFM ratio during the first postoperative year, which may compromise long-term treatment outcomes.

Labour issues and COVID‐19

The COVID‐19 pandemic has prompted Canada and several other countries to impose an economic shutdown to prevent a deadly public health crisis from becoming much deadlier. In the agriculture and food sector, several hundred thousand restaurant workers have lost their jobs. The rise in unemployment, the closing of restaurants and schools, and social distancing have triggered demand reductions for certain commodities and foods and demand increases for others, bringing along changes in demand for inputs including labour. Canadian employers of temporary foreign workers (TFWs) are facing delays and additional constraints in recruiting, but so have US and European employers of TFWs. Rising food security concerns are making protectionist trade policies popular. Domestic and foreign firms may export less and do more foreign direct investment, inducing trade in jobs.

Analysis of complement deposition and viral RNA in placentas of COVID-19 patients

Abstract COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is increasingly being recognized as a systemic thrombotic and microvascular injury syndrome that may have its roots in complement activation. We had the opportunity to study the placental pathology of five full-term births to COVID-19 patients. All five exhibited histology indicative of fetal vascular malperfusion characterized by focal avascular villi and thrombi in larger fetal vessels. Vascular complement deposition in the placentas was not abnormal, and staining for viral RNA and viral spike protein was negative. While all cases resulted in healthy, term deliveries, these findings indicate the systemic nature of COVID-19 infection. The finding of vascular thrombosis without complement deposition may reflect the systemic nature of COVID-19's procoagulant effects unrelated to systemic complement activation.

Clinical correlates of fatigue in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.

INTRODUCTION Fatigue is a recognised manifestation of immune-mediated neuropathies, but its causes and implications are unclear. This study aimed to explore the correlates of fatigue amongst a number of clinical parameters in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), in order to better understand potential contributing factors and resulting consequences. METHODS Twenty-six clinically stable CIDP patients underwent assessments of motor and sensory function, disability, quality of life and depression and anxiety. Experienced fatigue was assessed using the Rasch-built fatigue severity scale and Checklist of Individual Strength. RESULTS The two utilized fatigue scales showed significant inter-correlation. Only depression scores and grip strength predicted experienced fatigue levels in multivariate regression analyses. Fatigue scores inversely correlated with strength, sensory, disability and quality of life scores. DISCUSSION Experienced fatigue is likely multifactorial in CIDP, with both physical and neuropsychiatric components. Fatigue is associated with lower functional and quality-of-life outcomes in CIDP.

Complete Characterization of Incorrect Orthology Assignments in Best Match Graphs

Genome-scale orthology assignments are usually based on reciprocal best matches. In the absence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), every pair of orthologs forms a reciprocal best match. Incorrect orthology assignments therefore are always false positives in the Reciprocal Best Match Graph. We consider duplication/loss scenarios and characterize unambiguous false-positive (u-fp) orthology assignments, that is, edges in the Best Match Graphs (BMGs) that cannot correspond to orthologs for any gene tree that explains the BMG. We characterize u-fp edges in terms of subgraphs of the BMG and show that, given a BMG, there is a unique"augmented tree"that explains the BMG and identifies all u-fp edges in terms of overlapping sets of species in certain subtrees. The augmented tree can be constructed as a refinement of the unique least resolved tree of the BMG in polynomial time. Removal of the u-fp edges from the reciprocal best matches results in a unique orthology assignment.

Viral proteomics.

Viruses have long been studied not only for their pathology and associated disease but also as model systems for molecular processes and as tools for identifying important cellular regulatory proteins and pathways. Recent advances in mass spectrometry methods coupled with the development of proteomic approaches have greatly facilitated the detection of virion components, protein interactions in infected cells, and virally induced changes in the cellular proteome, resulting in a more comprehensive understanding of viral infection. In addition, a rapidly increasing number of high-resolution structures for viral proteins have provided valuable information on the mechanism of action of these proteins as well as aided in the design and understanding of specific inhibitors that could be used in antiviral therapies. In this paper, we discuss proteomic studies conducted on all eukaryotic viruses and bacteriophages, covering virion composition, viral protein structures, virus-virus and virus-host protein interactions, and changes in the cellular proteome upon viral infection.

In vitro susceptibility of 10 clinical isolates of SARS coronavirus to selected antiviral compounds

Abstract Effective antiviral agents are urgently needed to combat the possible return of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Commercial antiviral agents and pure chemical compounds extracted from traditional Chinese medicinal herbs were screened against 10 clinical isolates of SARS coronavirus by neutralisation tests with confirmation by plaque reduction assays. Interferon-beta-1a, leukocytic interferon-alpha, ribavirin, lopinavir, rimantadine, baicalin and glycyrrhizin showed antiviral activity. The two interferons were only active if the cell lines were pre-incubated with the drugs 16h before viral inoculation. Results were confirmed by plaque reduction assays. Antiviral activity varied with the use of different cell lines. Checkerboard assays for synergy were performed showing combinations of interferon beta-1a or leukocytic interferon-alpha with ribavirin are synergistic. Since the clinical and toxicity profiles of these agents are well known, they should be considered either singly or in combination for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS in randomised placebo controlled trials in future epidemics.

MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF HIV DISEASE IN CHILDREN

Pediatric HIV infection in the United States has evolved from a rapidly progressive, fatal disease in the early years of the epidemic to a chronic infection with prolonged survival. Many children with perinatally acquired infection survive to 8 years of age and older. The development of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), measurement of viral load, and availability of prophylactic medications to prevent certain opportunistic infections have dramatically altered the management of HIV infection. A total of 14 antiretroviral agents have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, 10 of which have been approved for use in pediatrics. Several new drugs are in various stages of development. This article discusses special issues in the medical management of children with HIV infection, including routine care, immunization, and treatment of some of the more common organ-specific manifestations, disclosure of the HIV diagnosis, pain management, palliative care, and the management of infants born to HIV-seropositive women.

Transmissible Gastroenteritis: Mucosal ion transport in acute viral enteritis

Ion transport in the jejunal mucosa of 14- to 16-day-old piglets with severe diarrhea 40hr after infection with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus was studied. In infected pigs Na(+) transport failed to. respond normally to glucose when studied either in Ussing short-circuited chambers or in suspensions of enterocytes isolated selectively from jejunal villi. Theophylline, 10 mm, added to the chambers produced the same brisk electrical responses and increments in net Cl(−) secretion in tissue from both infected and control groups. A defect in glucose-stimulated Na(+) absorption in the acute stage of a viral enteritis has been identified which probably contributes to the impaired lumen-to-extracellular fluid flux of Na(+) found previously in the jejunum of intact TGE-infected pigs. The mechanisms causing diarrhea in this invasive viral enteritis differ from those causing toxigenic diarrhea.

A first study on the impact of current and future control measures on the spread of COVID-19 in Germany

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), identified in China at the end of December 2019 and causing the disease COVID-19, has meanwhile led to outbreaks all over the globe, with about 571,700 confirmed cases and about 26,500 deaths as of March 28th, 2020. We present here the preliminary results of a mathematical study directed at informing on the possible application or lifting of control measures in Germany. The developed mathematical models allow to study the spread of COVID-19 among the population in Germany and to asses the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions. The overall goal is to suggest strategies for the mitigation of the current outbreak, slowing down the spread of the virus and thus reducing the peak in daily diagnosed cases, the demand for hospitalization or intensive care units admissions, and eventually fatalities.

The Italian coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak: recommendations from clinical practice

Novel coronavirus 2019 is a single-stranded, ribonucleic acid virus that has led to an international pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019. Clinical data from the Chinese outbreak have been reported, but experiences and recommendations from clinical practice during the Italian outbreak have not. We report the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on regional and national healthcare infrastructure. We also report on recommendations based on clinical experiences of managing patients throughout Italy. In particular, we describe key elements of clinical management, including: safe oxygen therapy; airway management; personal protective equipment; and non-technical aspects of caring for patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019. Only through planning, training and team working will clinicians and healthcare systems be best placed to deal with the many complex implications of this new pandemic.

Head and neck oncological ablation and reconstruction in the COVID-19 era - our experience to date

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption to the routine operations of healthcare services across the world. As the potential duration of the pandemic remains uncertain, the need to develop strategies to continue urgent elective services has received increasing attention. A solution adopted in the Kent, Sussex and Surrey area of England has been to create COVID-19-protected cancer hubs. The Queen Victoria Hospital is the designated hub for head and neck cancer services in the area. We report on the evolution of the head and neck cancer care pathway and standard operating protocols put in place and how these have combined both national guidelines and local problem solving. It is hoped that our experience can help guide other centres as they re-establish head and neck cancer services during the ongoing pandemic.

A telemetric study of physiologic changes in mice with induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis

Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system may be an important component of disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS), a paralytic inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Using the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse model of MS, the authors carried out a pilot study to investigate whether telemetric monitoring might be a feasible approach for detecting disturbances in the autonomic control of heart rate and blood pressure after disease induction. Telemetric monitoring devices that were implanted in mice provided useful information regarding the physiologic changes that accompanied disease induction and progression. Changes were observed in heart rate, blood pressure, heart rate variability and diurnal rhythm immediately before and after disease onset. The device implantation procedure did not seem to alter the course of disease. Further investigation may establish these methods as a system for studying the relationships between MS progression and autonomic regulation of physiological status.

COVID-19 and the food system: setback or opportunity for gender equality?

Agriculture and the food sector are critical to food and nutrition security because they not only produce food but also contribute to economic empowerment by employing a large share of female and male workers, especially in developing countries. Food systems at all levels―globally, domestically, locally, and in the home― are expected to be highly affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Women and men work as food producers, processors, and traders and will likely be impacted differently. Shocks or crises can exacerbate or reduce gender gaps, and so can policy responses to mitigate the impact of these crises or shocks. We offer some perspectives and available country examples on how the COVID-19 crisis and responses to the crisis could be a setback or offer opportunities for gender equality in the food system.

Contact pathway of coagulation and inflammation

The contact system, also named as plasma kallikrein-kinin system, consists of three serine proteinases: coagulation factors XII (FXII) and XI (FXI), and plasma prekallikrein (PK), and the nonenzymatic cofactor high molecular weight kininogen (HK). This system has been investigated actively for more than 50 years. The components of this system and their interactions have been elucidated from in vitro experiments, which indicates that this system is prothrombotic by activating intrinsic pathway, and proinflammatory by producing bioactive peptide bradykinin. Although the activation of the contact system have been implicated in various types of human disease, in only a few instances is its role clearly defined. In the last 10 years, our understanding of the contact system, particularly its biology and (patho)physiology has greatly increased through investigations using gene-modified animal models. In this review we will describe a revitalized view of the contact system as a critical (patho)physiologic mediator of coagulation and inflammation.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Can Masquerade as Acute Postoperative Periprosthetic Joint Infection

Fever etiology during the first postoperative days following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) may be challenging to solve. Early periprosthetic joint infection is the main reason; however, other equally important causes must be excluded such as thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis, and chest or urinary tract infections. We report the case of a 70-year-old Caucasian female patient presented with high fever reaching 39°C, fatigue, and myalgia lasting for a week after a fully cemented primary TKA. Symptoms were falsely attributed to the surgical procedure, leading to erroneous early management and a complicated postoperative course. In the era of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARs-CoV-2) pandemic, a high index of suspicion for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms and viral chest infection must be raised, primarily in vulnerable patients.

Large uterus: what is the limit for a laparoscopic approach?

Hysterectomy is the most common surgical gynecologic procedure, which is frequently related to the treatment of leiomyoma. The laparoscopic hysterectomy is associated with a shorter hospital stay, fewer infection rates, and a faster return to daily activities. Most gynecologists do not recommend a hysterectomy via the vagina or a laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) in the case of a uterus weighing more than 300 g. This case report presents the case of an LAVH undertaken in a 43-year-old patient with a uterus weighing 2,800 g. There are no definite guidelines concerning the procedure for a large uterus, and the literature is vague regarding the best surgical procedure for these cases. The size of the uterus does not seem to be an absolute contraindication for endoscopic surgery. This procedure relies entirely on the surgeon's ability.

Study in performance analysis of China Urban Emergency Response System based on Petri net

Abstract Urban Emergency Response System (UERS) is a modernization symbol of a city. With acceleration of urbanization process and constant expansion of city size in China, China cities must respond to various emergencies timely and effectively to satisfy urban residents’ needs for public security. In recent years, many China cities made trials and efforts in setting up and improving the UERS. At the same time, the China government began to build Emergency Response Systems (ERS) in some cities to deal with various possible emergencies. In this paper, using Petri net (PN), we study the performance of China typical UERS and establish its PN model for performance analysis. Based on the Markov chain (MC) of the model, the performance of China typical UERS is analyzed. Results from our simulation are in conformity with practical operation of China current UERS.

Sufficient Solvability Conditions for Systems of Partial Fuzzy Relational Equations

This paper focuses on searching sufficient conditions for the solvability of systems of partial fuzzy relational equations. In the case of solvable systems, we provide solutions of the systems. Two standard systems of fuzzy relational equations – namely the systems built on the basic composition and on the Bandler-Kohout subproduct – are considered under the assumption of partiality. Such an extension requires to employ partial algebras of operations for dealing with undefined values. In this investigation, we consider seven most-known algebras of undefined values in partial fuzzy set theory such as the Bochvar, Bochvar external, Sobociński, McCarthy, Nelson, Kleene, and the Łukasiewicz algebra. Conditions that are sufficient for the solvability of the systems are provided. The crucial role will be played by the so-called boundary condition.

Laparoscopic left hepatectomy with prior vascular control.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic major resections remain a challenge for liver surgeons. This video illustrates, step by step, our laparoscopic technique for left hepatectomy. METHODS The control of vascular inflow and outflow as well as the division of the left hepatic duct were carried out extraparenchymally before liver transection. Between 2002 and 2008, 11 left hepatectomies were performed by laparoscopy: 7 for liver tumor and 4 for localized Caroli's disease. RESULTS Mean duration of surgery was 248 +/- 25 min. Mean operative blood loss was 129 +/- 42 ml. Intraoperative blood transfusion or conversion to laparotomy were never required. One postoperative biliary collection occurred and was drained percutaneously. None of the patients died. Mean hospital stay was 7.6 +/- 2.2 days. CONCLUSIONS This technique has proved to be safe and easily reproducible.

Inhibition of human adenoviruses by 1-(2′-hydroxy-5′-methoxybenzylidene)amino-3-hydroxyguanidine tosylate

Antiviral activities of four Schiff bases of aminohydroxyguanidine, designated ML1, ML4, ATL14 and LK11, were tested against human adenovirus types 5 and 8 (Ad5 and Ad8) in A549 cells by plaque reduction and virus yield reduction methods. Compound ML1 1-(2′-hydroxy-5′-methoxybenzylidene)amino-3-hydroxyguanidine tosylate gave the best therapeutic indices (TC(50)/IC(50)) of 27.2 and 17.8 for Ad5 and Ad8, respectively. Pretreatment of cells with ML1 did not affect the adsorption nor the penetration of virus. Ultrastructure studies showed that only the drug treated infected cells had unidentified irregular shaped electron dense structures that might be drug altered viral macromolecules that were not assembled into complete infectious virus particles. Since these compounds have metal chelating properties, their antiviral activity may involve the early IA (EIA) gene which encodes a viral protein of 289 amino acid which has a zinc finger moiety that is required for its transactivation activity.

Expecting the unexpected: Echo laboratory preparedness in the time of COVID-19.

COVID-19 poses a unique set of challenges to the healthcare system due to its rapid spread, intensive resource utilization, and relatively high morbidity and mortality. Healthcare workers are at especially high risk of exposure given the viruses spread through close contact. Reported cardiac complications of COVID-19 include myocarditis, acute coronary syndrome, cardiomyopathy, pericardial effusion, arrhythmia, and shock. Thus, echocardiography is integral in the timely diagnosis and clinical management of COVID-19 patients. Rush University Medical Center has been at the forefront of the COVID-19 response in Illinois with high numbers of cases reported in Chicago and surrounding areas. The echocardiography laboratory at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC) proactively took numerous steps to balance the imaging needs of a busy, nearly 700-bed academic medical center while maintaining safety.

Nucleoside Phosphate and Phosphonate Prodrug Clinical Candidates.

Nucleoside monophosphates and monophosphonates have been known for a long time to exert favorable pharmacological effects upon intracellular delivery. However, their development as drug molecules has been hindered by the inherent poor druglike properties of the monophosphate and monophosphonate groups. These include inefficient cellular uptake and poor in vivo stability, with this latter drawback being most relevant to monophosphates than monophosphonates. To address these limitations, numerous monophosphate and monophosphonate prodrug strategies have been developed and applied in the discovery of nucleoside monophosphate and monophosphonate prodrugs that can treat viral infections and cancer. The approval of sofosbuvir, a nucleoside monophosphate prodrug, highlighted the success to be had by employing these prodrug technologies in the discovery of nucleotide therapeutics. In this Miniperspective, we discuss the different key monophosphate and monophosphonate nucleoside prodrugs that entered clinical development, some of which may in the future be approved to treat various human diseases.

CORONAVIRUS E PROTEIN FORMS ION CHANNELS WITH FUNCTIONALLY AND STRUCTURALLY-INVOLVED MEMBRANE LIPIDS

Coronavirus (CoV) envelope (E) protein ion channel activity was determined in channels formed in planar lipid bilayers by peptides representing either the transmembrane domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) E protein, or the full-length E protein. Both of them formed a voltage independent ion conductive pore with symmetric ion transport properties. Mutations N15A and V25F located in the transmembrane domain, prevented the ion conductivity. E protein derived channels showed no cation preference in non-charged lipid membranes, whereas they behaved as pores with mild cation selectivity in negatively-charged lipid membranes. The ion conductance was also controlled by the lipid composition of the membrane. Lipid charge also regulated the selectivity of a HCoV-229E E protein derived peptide. These results suggested that the lipids are functionally involved in E protein ion channel activity, forming a protein-lipid pore, a novel concept for CoV E protein ion channel entity.

Phagocytic cells contribute to the antibody-mediated elimination of pulmonary-infected SARS coronavirus

Abstract While the 2002–2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resulted in 774 deaths, patients who were affected with mild pulmonary symptoms successfully recovered. The objective of the present work was to identify, using SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse infection models, immune factors responsible for clearing of the virus. The elimination of pulmonary SARS-CoV infection required the activation of B cells by CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, passive immunization (post-infection) with homologous (murine) anti-SARS-CoV antiserum showed greater elimination efficacy against SARS-CoV than that with heterologous (rabbit) antiserum, despite the use of equivalent titers of neutralizing antibodies. This distinction was mediated by mouse phagocytic cells (monocyte-derived infiltrating macrophages and partially alveolar macrophages, but not neutrophils), as demonstrated both by adoptive transfer from donors and by immunological depletion of selected cell types. These results indicate that the cooperation of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and phagocytic cells plays an important role in the elimination of SARS-CoV.

Modeling and Simulation of a Fully-glycosylated Full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein in a Viral Membrane

This technical study describes all-atom modeling and simulation of a fully-glycosylated full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in a viral membrane. First, starting from PDB:6VSB and 6VXX, full-length S protein structures were modeled using template-based modeling, de-novo protein structure prediction, and loop modeling techniques in GALAXY modeling suite. Then, using the recently-determined most occupied glycoforms, 22 N-glycans and 1 O-glycan of each monomer were modeled using Glycan Reader & Modeler in CHARMM-GUI. These fully-glycosylated full-length S protein model structures were assessed and further refined against the low-resolution data in their respective experimental maps using ISOLDE. We then used CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder to place the S proteins in a viral membrane and performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. All structures are available in CHARMM-GUI COVID-19 Archive (http://www.charmm-gui.org/docs/archive/covid19), so researchers can use these models to carry out innovative and novel modeling and simulation research for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

Chronic Kidney Disease-Associated Immune Dysfunctions: Impact of Protein-Bound Uremic Retention Solutes on Immune Cells

Regardless of the primary disease responsible for kidney failure, patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) have in common multiple impairments of both the innate and adaptive immune systems, the pathophysiology of which has long remained enigmatic. CKD-associated immune dysfunction includes chronic low-grade activation of monocytes and neutrophils, which induces endothelial damage and increases cardiovascular risk. Although innate immune effectors are activated during CKD, their anti-bacterial capacity is impaired, leading to increased susceptibility to extracellular bacterial infections. Finally, CKD patients are also characterized by profound alterations of cellular and humoral adaptive immune responses, which account for an increased risk for malignancies and viral infections. This review summarizes the recent emerging data that link the pathophysiology of CKD-associated immune dysfunctions with the accumulation of microbiota-derived metabolites, including indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate, the two best characterized protein-bound uremic retention solutes.

Two-photon microscopy as a tool to study blood flow and neurovascular coupling in the rodent brain.

The cerebral vascular system services the constant demand for energy during neuronal activity in the brain. Attempts to delineate the logic of neurovascular coupling have been greatly aided by the advent of two-photon laser scanning microscopy to image both blood flow and the activity of individual cells below the surface of the brain. Here we provide a technical guide to imaging cerebral blood flow in rodents. We describe in detail the surgical procedures required to generate cranial windows for optical access to the cortex of both rats and mice and the use of two-photon microscopy to accurately measure blood flow in individual cortical vessels concurrent with local cellular activity. We further provide examples on how these techniques can be applied to the study of local blood flow regulation and vascular pathologies such as small-scale stroke.

Hyper-phosphorylation of nsp2-related proteins of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus

Abstract Viruses exploit phosphorylation of both viral and host proteins to support viral replication. In this study, we demonstrate that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus replicase nsp2, and two nsp2-related −2/−1 frameshifting products, nsp2TF and nsp2N, are hyper-phosphorylated. By mapping phosphorylation sites, we subdivide an extended, previously uncharacterized region, located between the papain-like protease-2 (PLP2) domain and frameshifting site, into three distinct domains. These domains include two large hypervariable regions (HVR) with putative intrinsically disordered structures, separated by a conserved and partly structured interval domain that we defined as the inter-HVR conserved domain (IHCD). Abolishing phosphorylation of the inter-species conserved residue serine918, which is located within the IHCD region, abrogates accumulation of viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs and recombinant virus production. Our study reveals the biological significance of phosphorylation events in nsp2-related proteins, emphasizes pleiotropic functions of nsp2-related proteins in the viral life cycle, and presents potential links to pathogenesis.

Deconvoluting Lipid Nanoparticle Structure for Messenger RNA Delivery

Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) packaged mRNA vaccines have been deployed against infectious diseases such as COVID-19, yet their structural features remain unclear. Cholesterol, a major constituent within LNPs, contributes to their morphology that influences gene delivery. Herein, we examine the structure of LNPs containing cholesterol derivatives using electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and membrane fluidity assays. LNPs formulated with C24 alkyl derivatives of cholesterol show a polymorphic shape and various degrees of multilamellarity and lipid partitioning, likely due to phase separation. The addition of methyl and ethyl groups to the C24 alkyl tail of the cholesterol backbone induces multilamellarity (>50% increase compared to cholesterol), while the addition of a double bond induces lipid partitioning (>90% increase compared to cholesterol). LNPs with multilamellar and faceted structures, as well as a lamellar lipid phase, showed higher gene transfection. Unraveling the structure of mRNA-LNPs can enable their rational design toward enhanced gene delivery.

Herd immunity and a vaccination game: An experimental study

Would the affected communities voluntarily obtain herd immunity if a cure for COVID-19 was available? This paper experimentally investigates people's vaccination choices in the context of a nonlinear public good game. A "vaccination game" is defined in which costly commitments (vaccination) are required of a fraction of the population to reach the critical level needed for herd immunity, without which defectors are punished by the natural contagion of epidemics. Our experimental implementation of a vaccination game in a controlled laboratory setting reveals that endogenous epidemic punishment is a credible threat, resulting in voluntary vaccination to obtain herd immunity, for which the orthodox principle of positive externalities fails to account. The concave nature of the infection probability plays a key role in facilitating the elimination of an epidemic.

Virulence factor-activity relationships: workshop summary.

The concept or notion of virulence factor-activity relationships (VFAR) is an approach for identifying an analogous process to the use of qualitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) for identifying new microbial contaminants. In QSAR, it is hypothesized that, for new chemical contaminants, their potential acute or chronic toxicity may be reasonably estimated on the basis of structural relationships to other known toxic contaminants. Thus the parallel that is being attempted for pathogenic microorganisms is that known virulence factors may be used as predictors for identifying undiscovered pathogens and microbial causes of emerging diseases. Advances in molecular biology, genomics and proteomics have led the Committee on Drinking Water Contaminants of the National Research Council, as requested by the EPA, to recommend the VFAR approach as a potentially more systematic and scientific process for the selection of microorganisms for inclusion in the Contaminant Candidate List (CCL).

DLI Induced by Herbal Medicine: What Are the Characteristics of DLI due to Herbal Medicines?

In many countries, herbal medicine has been developed and is currently practiced. Herbal medicine involves the use of the stalks, roots, leaves, flowers, and berries of several different plant species for medical treatment. Many practitioners believe that herbal medication has no side effects because of its natural origin. Thus, herbal medication has been used for a long time with little awareness of its side effects. However, there is an increasing incidence of interstitial pneumonia due to a drug-induced lung injury (DLI), which could be induced by common drugs. Moreover, increasing cases of bronchiolitis obliterans and pulmonary hypertension are being reported; further, these are drug-induced conditions. Clinicians should be more aware of DLI symptoms caused by herbal medication and interrogate patients regarding their use of herbal medication and supplements as well as prescription drugs.

The synthetic LPS binding peptide 19-2.5 interferes with clotting and prevents degradation of high molecular weight kininogen in plasma.

Sepsis and septic shock are life-threatening conditions and remain an important medical problem, emphasizing the need to identify novel therapeutic approaches. Coagulation dysfunction, hypotension, disturbed microcirculation and multiorgan failure occur frequently. These severe conditions result from an overwhelming inflammatory response, induced by pathogen and damage associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) released into the bloodstream. In the present study, we demonstrated that the synthetic Lipopolysaccharid (LPS)-binding peptide 19-2.5 interferes with the activation of the coagulation and contact system. Moreover, binding of LPS to high molecular weight kininogen (HK), one of the major LPS carrier in blood, could be prevented by the peptide. Thus, peptide 19-2.5 might represent a promising target in the treatment of endotoxemia and sepsis, not only by its anti-inflammatory potential, but also by the anticoagulant effect, together with its ability to prevent degradation of HK.

Combined endothelial and epithelial barrier disruption of the colon may be a contributing factor to the Ebola sepsis-like syndrome.

After an initial febrile viral syndrome, infection with Ebola virus often induces an explosive late "Ebola sepsis-like syndrome" which appears very similar to some phenotypes of bacterial sepsis and is commonly fatal. It is possible that direct and diffuse viral infection of both the endothelium and epithelium of the colon may cause sufficient disruption of both the endothelial and epithelial barriers to induce exposure or leakage of endotoxin and bacterial antigens to, or into, the vascular system precipitating or exacerbating the Ebola sepsis-like syndrome. If colonic barrier disruption or vascular exposure of bacterial antigens from the colon is found to comprise an important mechanism of the Ebola sepsis-like syndrome, protocolized timed decontamination of the bowel with or without timed prophylactic antibiotics might warrant investigation.

Immunomic Discovery of Adjuvants, Delivery Systems, and Candidate Subunit Vaccines: A Brief Introduction

Mass vaccination, when coupled to profound improvements in general sanitation, has given rise to the most remarkable transformation in public health in human history. Yet the development of vaccines remains largely trapped in the past, a hostage to the methodology of Pasteur. Infectious disease continues to threaten humanity, with new and renascent diseases emerging continually. The last two decades have seen a breath-taking revival in the commercial market for vaccines and the simultaneous emergence of a whole tranche of new technologies that promise to free vaccine development from the muddle of empirical thinking. In this short introduction, we set the scene for this renaissance, and explore how the combination of computational and experimental techniques promise so much for the future development of vaccines and the science of vaccinology.

Managing Information in the Case of Opinion Spamming

The rapid innovation of information and communication technology (ICT) within the last decades has come along with the development of new opportunities and challenges, new business models, new systems, etc. Companies like Amazon, Google or Alibaba shape business functions and percolate our daily life. Business operations go hand in hand with new types of user experiences when buying goes different than just traditional ways. Often it is not only the buying behavior but also the way recommendations are perceived as they may be readily available. This relates to opinion mining and, unfortunately, opinion spamming. We survey the issue of opinion spamming and fake review detection and focus on both sides of fake review groups, i.e., how to detect such groups but also how to set up a group that might be undetected with current methods. As both directions go hand in hand we elaborate on learning in both directions with the aim to improve related methods.

Switch from oral anticoagulants to parenteral heparin in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized patients

The development of COVID-19 syndrome in anticoagulated patients, and especially their admission to intensive-care units with acute severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), expose them to specific problems related to their therapy, in addition to those associated with the acute viral infection. Patients on VKA hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 show high instability of PT INR due to the variability of vitamin K metabolism, diet, fasting, co-medications, liver impairment, and heart failure. Patients on DOAC are exposed to under/over treatment caused by significant pharmacological interferences. In consideration of the pharmacological characteristics of oral anticoagulant drugs, the multiple pharmacological interactions due to the treatment of acute disease and the possible necessity of mechanical ventilation with hospitalization in intensive-care units, we suggest replacing oral anticoagulant therapies (VKA and DOAC) with parenteral heparin to avoid the risk of over/under treatment.

Isolation and characterization of a highly pathogenic strain of Porcine enteric alphacoronavirus causing watery diarrhoea and high mortality in newborn piglets

Porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV) was first discovered in China in February 2017, and the origin and virulence of this novel porcine coronavirus were not fully characterized. Here, we isolated a strain of PEAV, named GDS04 that is identified by immunofluorescence and typical crown‐shaped particles observed with electron microscopy. Genomic analysis reveals that PEAV GDS04 shares a close relationship with SADS‐CoV and SeACoV. Furthermore, newborn piglets orally challenged with PEAV GDS04 developed typical clinical symptoms as watery diarrhoea in neonatal piglets. Viral RNA was detected in faeces and various tissues of the infected piglets. Moreover, macroscopic and microscopic lesions in whole intestinal tract were observed, and viral antigen could be detected in the small intestines by immunohistochemical staining and electron microscopy. Importantly, the mortality rate of inoculated‐newborn piglets was 100% and half of the cohabiting piglets died. Collectively, we demonstrate that PEAV is highly pathogenic in newborn piglets.

33 Other viruses

Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the characteristics of other viruses. The reovirus family is composed of three groups—reovirus, orbivirus, and rotavirus—and can cause infections in both man and animals. Other reoviruses are pathogenic to insects and plants. The orbivirus group consists of a large number of members, some of which are transmitted by vectors and, therefore, belong to the heterogenic arboviruses. Of the orbiviruses, the Colorado tick fever virus is the only one known to cause disease in man. As indicated by its name, the vector is a tick and the virus produces a febrile illness with myalgia. Arboviruses, that is, viruses borne by arthropod vectors and multiplying both in the arthropod and in the animal on which the arthropod is parasitic, show markedly variable morphological and biochemical characteristics. Coronavirus-like particles have been observed in fecal specimens of patients with gastroenteritis symptoms in India, Australia, Gambia, West Germany, and other countries.

Recent advances in understanding Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a widely distributed hemorrhagic fever virus and the cause of hemorrhagic disease in Africa, Southern and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, India and Asia. Recent emergence of CCHFV into Spain indicates that the geographic range of this virus is expanding and the presence of its tick vector in several countries without reported disease suggest that CCHFV will continue to spread. Research into CCHFV was historically limited by a lack of suitable animal models and tools to study viral pathogenesis. However, in the past few years the toolset for studying CCHFV has expanded with small animal and non-human primate models for CCHFV being developed along with a reverse genetics system that allows for investigation of viral determinants of disease. These tools have been utilized to understand how CCHFV antagonizes host restriction factors and to develop novel vaccine candidates that may help limit the substantial morbidity and mortality in humans caused by CCHFV.

Kidney Infarction in Patients With COVID-19

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious, life-threatening infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent findings indicate an increased risk of acute kidney injury during COVID-19. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to acute kidney injury in COVID-19 are unclear, but may include direct cytopathic effects of the virus on kidney tubular and endothelial cells, indirect damage caused by virus-induced cytokine release, and kidney hypoperfusion due to a restrictive fluid strategy. In this case-report we propose an additional pathophysiological mechanism. We describe two cases in which patients with COVID-19 developed a decrease in kidney function due to kidney infarction. These patients did not have atrial fibrillation. One of these patients was treated with therapeutic doses of low molecular weight heparin, whereafter no further deterioration of kidney function was observed. Our findings implicate that the differential diagnosis of acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients should include kidney infarction, which may have important preventive and therapeutic implications.

Thrombopoietin levels increased in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome

Abstract Hematological changes in patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are common and frequently include thrombocytopenia. Using a ELISA method, we found an increase in thrombopoietin (TPO) levels in the plasma of convalesced SARS patients (290±53 pg/ml) and active SARS patients (251±23 pg/ml) comparing to that from normal control patients (228±17 pg/ml). In addition, the plasma from active SARS patients had an inhibitory effect on CFU-MK formation, which could be neutralized by anti-TGF-β antibodies. In the experiment to determine whether SARS-CoV can directly infect hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocytic cells, incubation of the cells with SARS-CoV did not show active infection. Our findings of increased TPO levels in the plasma of SARS patients provide a possible explanation for the genesis of thrombocytosis, which frequently develops from thrombocytopenia in SARS patients.

Tracheotomy in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 pandemic continues to produce a large number of patients with chronic respiratory failure and ventilator dependence. As such, surgeons will be called upon to perform tracheotomy for a subset of these chronically intubated patients. As seen during the SARS and the SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, aerosol-generating procedures (AGP) have been associated with higher rates of infection of medical personnel and potential acceleration of viral dissemination throughout the medical center. Therefore, a thoughtful approach to tracheotomy (and other AGPs) is imperative and maintaining traditional management norms may be unsuitable or even potentially harmful. We sought to review the existing evidence informing best practices and then develop straightforward guidelines for tracheotomy during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This communication is the product of those efforts and is based on national and international experience with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the SARS epidemic of 2002/2003.

Laboratory diagnosis of SARS.

The emergence of new viral infections of man requires the development of robust diagnostic tests that can be applied in the differential diagnosis of acute illness, or to determine past exposure, so as to establish the true burden of disease. Since the recognition in April 2003 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), enormous efforts have been applied to develop molecular and serological tests for SARS which can assist rapid detection of cases, accurate diagnosis of illness and the application of control measures. International progress in the laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection during acute illness has led to internationally agreed World Health Organization criteria for the confirmation of SARS. Developments in the dissection of the human immune response to SARS indicate that serological tests on convalescent sera are essential to confirm SARS infection, given the sub-optimal predictive value of molecular detection tests performed during acute SARS illness.

Sources and symptoms of stress among nurses in the first Chinese anti-Ebola medical team during the Sierra Leone aid mission: A qualitative study

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the sources of stress, corresponding symptoms, and stress relief among nurses of the first Chinese anti-Ebola medical team during the Sierra Leone aid mission. METHOD: A purposive sampling method was used and 10 nurses were selected from the first Chinese anti-Ebola medical team that was dispatched to Sierra Leone. Data were collected via phone and semi-structured interviews, then analyzed using Colaizzi's seven-step method. RESULTS: The data showed three major themes: (1) The causes of stress during the Sierra Leone aid mission mainly related to unsafety, responsibility, and unfamiliarity; (2) Physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms were documented; (3) Nurses experienced relief from stress after the mission. CONCLUSION: Targeted measures, proper responses and good community support can effectively lower stress among nurses on anti-Ebola missions.

'I have faith in science and in God': Common sense, cognitive polyphasia and attitudes to science in Nigeria.

This study, of modern common sense in Nigeria, combines questionnaires and interviews to examine the compatibility and incompatibility of religion and science. Nigeria is a large country with a complex diversity of religious, ethnic and cultural practices that condition the reception and elaboration of science in everyday life. We find evaluative attitudes to science structured as 'progress', 'fear' and 'mythical image'. Scientific knowledge and religiosity have a direct bearing on expectations of progress and feeling of fear and worry about science; mythical image is independent of this. Nigerians trust both scientific and religious authorities in contrast to other social actors. Many of the results are consistent with the hypothesis of cognitive polyphasia of scientific and religious knowing manifesting as a 'hierarchy', when one form is elevated over the other; 'parallelity', when both serve separate functions; and 'empowerment', where one enhances the other.

The Implication of Oxidative Stress and AMPK-Nrf2 Antioxidative Signaling in Pneumonia Pathogenesis

It is widely recognized that chemical, physical, and biological factors can singly or synergistically evoke the excessive production of oxidative stress in pulmonary tissue that followed by pulmonary lesions and pneumonia. In addition, metabolic and endocrine disorder-induced diseases such as diabetes and obesity often expressed higher susceptibility to pulmonary infections, and presented severe symptoms which increasing the mortality rate. Therefore, the connection between the lesion of the lungs and the metabolic/endocrine disorders is an interesting and essential issue to be addressed. Studies have noticed a similar pathological feature in both infectious pneumonia and metabolic disease-intercurrent pulmonary lesions, that is, from the view of molecular pathology, the accumulation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) in pulmonary tissue accompanying with activated pro-inflammatory signals. Meanwhile, Adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling plays important role in metabolic/endocrine homeostasis and infection response, and it's closely associated with the anti-oxidative capacity of the body. For this reason, this review will start from the summary upon the implication of ROS accumulation, and to discuss how AMPK-Nrf2 signaling contributes to maintaining the metabolic/endocrine homeostasis and attenuates the susceptibility of pulmonary infections.

Traumatic abdominal wall hernias: an emerging trend in handlebar injuries.

Handlebar injuries are well described in pediatric patients and are frequently associated with internal injuries, including the "classic" duodenal hematoma and solid organ injuries. Before this report, traumatic handlebar hernias were considered rare. They occur when the end of the handlebar (often bare or lacking protective equipment) applies a significant force to a focal area of the abdomen leading to a disruption in the underlying muscle fibers and fascia while sparing the overlying skin. Such nonpenetrating injuries may present with subtle clinical signs and should always be considered in the differential diagnosis. Imaging, with the use of computed tomographic scan or ultrasound will confirm the diagnosis as well as identify any associated injuries. The management plan usually requires surgical exploration and repair of the defect. The prognosis is favorable presuming that there is no significant underlying injury. In this report, we present a series of 5 patients with traumatic handlebar hernia-the most frequently-occurring injury in our series-and review concurrent associated injuries.

A new threat from an old enemy: Re­emergence of coronavirus (Review)

The new outbreak of coronavirus from December 2019 has brought attention to an old viral enemy and has raised concerns as to the ability of current protection measures and the healthcare system to handle such a threat. It has been known since the 1960s that coronaviruses can cause respiratory infections in humans; however, their epidemic potential was understood only during the past two decades. In the present review, we address current knowledge on coronaviruses from a short history to epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestation of the disease, as well as treatment and prevention strategies. Although a great amount of research and efforts have been made worldwide to prevent further outbreaks of coronavirus­associated disease, the spread and lethality of the 2019 outbreak (COVID­19) is proving to be higher than previous epidemics on account of international travel density and immune naivety of the population. Only strong, joint and coordinated efforts of worldwide healthcare systems, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies and receptive national leaders will succeed in suppressing an outbreak of this scale.

Is the lockdown important to prevent the COVID-9 pandemic? Effects on psychology, environment and economy-perspective

COVID-19's daily increasing cases and deaths have led to worldwide lockdown, quarantine and some restrictions. This study aims to analyze the effect of lockdown days on the spread of coronavirus in countries. COVID-19 cases and lockdown days data were collected for 49 countries that implemented the lockdown between certain dates (without interruption). The correlation tests were used for data analysis based on unconstrained (normal) and constrained (Tukey-lambda). The lockdown days was significantly correlated with COVID-19 pandemic based on unconstrained (r = −0.9126, F-ratio = 6.1654; t-ratio = 2.40; prob > .0203 with 49 observations) and based on Tukey-lambda (r = 0.7402, λ = 0.14). The lockdown, one of the social isolation restrictions, has been observed to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic, and showed that the spread of the virus can be significantly reduced by this preventive restriction in this study. This study offers initial evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic can be suppressed by a lockdown. The application of lockdown by governments is also thought to be effective on psychology, environment and economy besides having impact on Covid-19.

Impact of lockdown measures during COVID-19 on air quality- A case study of India

A novel infectious coronavirus disease (COVID-19) identified in late 2019 has now been labelled as a global pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO). The COVID-19 outbreak has shown some positive impacts on the natural environment. In present work, India is taken as a case study to evaluate the effect of lockdown on air quality of three Indian cities. The variation in concentration of key air pollutants including [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] during two phases, pre-lockdown and post-lockdown phases, was analysed. The concentration of [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] reduced by 55%, 49%, 60% and 19%, and 44%, 37%, 78% and 39% for Delhi and Mumbai, respectively, during post-lockdown phase. Overall, the findings in present study may provide confidence to the stakeholders involved in air quality policy development that a significant improvement in air quality can be achieved in future if better pollution control plans are strictly executed.

RNA-Cleaving DNA Enzymes and Their Potential Therapeutic Applications as Antibacterial and Antiviral Agents

DNA catalysts are synthetic single-stranded DNA molecules that have been identified by in vitro selection from random sequence DNA pools. The most prominent representatives of DNA catalysts (also known as DNA enzymes, deoxyribozymes, or DNAzymes) catalyze the site-specific cleavage of RNA substrates. Two distinct groups of RNA-cleaving DNA enzymes are the 10-23 and 8-17 enzymes. A typical RNA-cleaving DNA enzyme consists of a catalytic core and two short binding arms which form Watson–Crick base pairs with the RNA targets. RNA cleavage is usually achieved with the assistance of metal ions such as Mg(2+), Ca(2+), Mn(2+), Pb(2+), or Zn(2+), but several chemically modified DNA enzymes can cleave RNA in the absence of divalent metal ions. A number of studies have shown the use of 10-23 DNA enzymes for modest downregulation of therapeutically relevant RNA targets in cultured cells and in whole mammals. Here we focus on mechanistic aspects of RNA-cleaving DNA enzymes and their potential to silence therapeutically appealing viral and bacterial gene targets. We also discuss delivery options and challenges involved in DNA enzyme-based therapeutic strategies.

Evaluation of serum neutralizing antibodies to bovine coronavirus in cows & their calves using Hmlu-1 cells.

Between 1992 and 1993, 75 paired serum samples from Holstein dairy cows and their calves were collected from Aomori, Tochigi and Okinawa Prefectures, and the neutralizing antibody titres to bovine coronavirus (BCV) were determined using hamster lung (Hmlu)-1 cells. The anti-BCV antibody positive rate in the maternal serum samples was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in Okinawa (72%) than in Aomori (100%) or Tochigi (100%). The geometric mean tire (GMT) of anti-BCV neutralizing antibody was also significantly lower (P < 0.05) in maternal sera from Okinawa (89) than that of Aomori (229) or Tochigi (264). The anti-BCV neutralizing antibody titres in the sera of calves which had ingested the colostrum, significantly correlated with the antibody concentration of the maternal serum samples (P < 0.05). These results suggest an extensive BCV infection among the dairy cattle in these prefectures, with a varied pattern of distribution between the prefectures. Anti-BCV neutralizing antibody in the sera of newborn calves appeared to be transferred from their dams through colostrum.

Safety guidelines for non‐surgical facial procedures during covid‐19 outbreak

BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus (COVID‐19) pandemic is expected to last for an extended time, making strict safety precautions for office procedures unavoidable. The lockdown is going to be lifted in many areas, and strict guidelines detailing the infection control measures for aesthetic clinics are going to be of particular importance. METHODS: A virtual meeting was conducted with the members (n=12) of the European Academy of Facial Plastic Surgery Focus Group to outline the safety protocol for the non‐surgical facial aesthetic procedures for aesthetic practices in order to protect the clinic staff and the patients from SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The data analysis was undertaken by thematic and iterative approach. RESULTS: Consensus guidelines for non‐surgical facial aesthetic procedures based on current knowledge are provided for three levels: precautions before visiting the clinic, precautions during the clinic visit, and precautions after the clinic visit. CONCLUSIONS: Sound infection control measures are mandatory for non‐surgical aesthetic practices all around the world. These may vary from country to country, but this logical approach can be customized according to the respective country laws and guidelines.

Public Health Laboratories

This chapter will review the multiple functions of Public Health Laboratories (PHLs), including their differences to commercial clinical laboratories. For example, the types of samples submitted to PHLs differ from those submitted to commercial clinical laboratories. PHLs are critically important to population based healthcare; playing an essential role in the detection of disease outbreaks. This chapter will describe the hierarchical organization of the PHL system in the Unites States, as well as the networks that have been created to support diverse PHL functions such as food safety testing and emergency response to terrorisms or natural disaster. It will briefly describe the standards used by PHLs and how the implementation of standards should further improve patient safety as a whole. In this chapter the reader will be introduced to PHL informatics in the context of the laboratories operational workflow – from test ordering, interfacing with diagnostic instruments, quality control and result reporting and analysis. The reader will also understand the impact of PHL informatics collaboration efforts and its effect on ongoing policy development.

Protective mAbs and Cross-Reactive mAbs Raised by Immunization with Engineered Marburg Virus GPs

The filoviruses, which include the marburg- and ebolaviruses, have caused multiple outbreaks among humans this decade. Antibodies against the filovirus surface glycoprotein (GP) have been shown to provide life-saving therapy in nonhuman primates, but such antibodies are generally virus-specific. Many monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been described against Ebola virus. In contrast, relatively few have been described against Marburg virus. Here we present ten mAbs elicited by immunization of mice using recombinant mucin-deleted GPs from different Marburg virus (MARV) strains. Surprisingly, two of the mAbs raised against MARV GP also cross-react with the mucin-deleted GP cores of all tested ebolaviruses (Ebola, Sudan, Bundibugyo, Reston), but these epitopes are masked differently by the mucin-like domains themselves. The most efficacious mAbs in this panel were found to recognize a novel “wing” feature on the GP2 subunit that is unique to Marburg and does not exist in Ebola. Two of these anti-wing antibodies confer 90 and 100% protection, respectively, one hour post-exposure in mice challenged with MARV.

Development of a Coronavirus Disease 2019 Nonhuman Primate Model Using Airborne Exposure

Airborne transmission is predicted to be a prevalent route of human exposure with SARS-CoV-2. Aside from African green monkeys, nonhuman primate models that replicate airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have not been investigated. A comprehensive and comparative evaluation of COVID-19 in African green monkeys, rhesus macaques, and cynomolgus macaques following airborne exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was performed to define parameters critical to disease progression and the extent to which they correlate with human COVID-19. Respiratory abnormalities and viral shedding were noted for all animals, indicating successful infection. Cynomolgus macaques developed fever, and thrombocytopenia was measured for African green monkeys and rhesus macaques. Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and alveolar fibrosis were more frequently observed in lung tissue from cynomolgus macaques and African green monkeys. The data indicate that, in addition to African green monkeys, macaques can be successfully infected by airborne SARS-CoV-2, providing viable macaque natural transmission models for medical countermeasure evaluation. One Sentence Summary Nonhuman primates develop COVID-19 following airborne virus exposure.

Coronaviruses widespread on nonliving surfaces: important questions and promising answers

The world is facing, while writing this review, a global pandemic due to one of the types of the coronaviruses (i.e., COVID-19), which is a new virus. Among the most important reasons for the transmission of infection between humans is the presence of this virus active on the surfaces and materials. Here, we addressed important questions such as do coronaviruses remain active on the inanimate surfaces? Do the types of inanimate surfaces affect the activity of coronaviruses? What are the most suitable ingredients that used to inactivate viruses? This review article addressed many of the works that were done in the previous periods on the survival of many viruses from the coronaviruses family on various surfaces such as steel, glass, plastic, Teflon, ceramic tiles, silicon rubber and stainless steel copper alloys, Al surface, sterile sponges, surgical gloves and sterile latex. The impacts of environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity were presented and discussed. The most important active ingredients that can deactivate viruses on the surfaces were reported here. We hope that these active ingredients will have the same effect on COVID-19.

Prefusion spike protein stabilization through computational mutagenesis

A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a human pathogen, causing global pandemic and resulting in over 400,000 deaths worldwide. The surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates the process of coronavirus entry into human cells by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Due to the critical role in viral-host interaction and the exposure of spike protein, it has been a focus of most vaccines’ developments. However, the structural and biochemical studies of the spike protein are challenging because it is thermodynamically metastable1. Here, we develop a new pipeline that automatically identifies mutants that thermodynamically stabilize the spike protein. Our pipeline integrates bioinformatics analysis of conserved residues, motion dynamics from molecular dynamics simulations, and other structural analysis to identify residues that significantly contribute to the thermodynamic stability of the spike protein. We then utilize our previously developed protein design tool, Eris, to predict thermodynamically stabilizing mutations in proteins. We validate the ability of our pipeline to identify protein stabilization mutants through known prefusion spike protein mutants. We finally utilize the pipeline to identify new prefusion spike protein stabilization mutants.

Serological evidence of Toxoplasma gondii infection in five species of bats in China.

Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that can infect almost all warm-blooded animals and humans with a worldwide distribution. Bats are reservoirs for an increasing number of emerging zoonotic viruses, such as henipaviruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). However, little is known of T. gondii infection in bats. The objective of the present study was to determine the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in bats in China. A total of 217 serum samples from 5 species of bats were collected between April, 2010, and August, 2011, from 4 provinces in China. Antibodies to T. gondii were determined using the modified agglutination test (MAT, 1:25 or higher). Antibodies to T. gondii were found in 26.5% (18/68) Megaderma lyra, 13.6% (12/88) Rousettus leschenaulti, 13.6% (3/22) Cynopterus sphinx, 20% (4/20) Vespertilio superaus, and 15.8% (3/19) Pipistrellus javanicus. Antibody titers ranged from 1:25 to 1:400, with titers of 1:200 detected in 4 of the 5 bat species. The present study suggests the likely occurrence of T. gondii infection in bats in China, and these bats are new putative hosts for T. gondii, which may pose a threat to human health.

[Clinical analysis of suspected COVID-19 patients with anxiety and depression].

OBJECTIVE To explore the risk factors of anxiety and depression in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) so as to achieve early intervention and better clinical prognosis. METHODS Seventy-six patients with suspected COVID-19 in fever isolation wards of Second Hospital of Lanzhou University were enrolled From January 31, 2020 to February 22, 2020. Their clinical baseline data were collected. The anxiety of patients was assessed by Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and the depression of patients was assessed by Hamilton Depression Scale. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors of anxiety and depression in these patients. RESULTS Female patients are more likely to have anxiety (OR=3.206, 95%CI: 1.073-9.583, P<0.05) and depression (OR=9.111, 95%CI: 2.143-38.729, P<0.01) than male patients; patients with known contact history of epidemic area and personnel in epidemic area are more likely to have depression (OR=3.267, 95%CI: 1.082-9.597, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS During the isolation treatment of suspected COVID-19 patients, early psychological intervention should be carried out for the female patients with known contact history of epidemic area and personnel in epidemic area, and drug treatment should be given in advance if necessary.

Public Health Emergency and Crisis Management: Case Study of SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused an unparalleled public health crisis, delivering an immense shock to humanity. With the virus's health consequences largely unknown, different health systems around the globe have pursued various avenues of crisis management. South Korea, troubled early by the virus, was once the second most affected nation in the world. Arrays of measures in South Korea, such as large-scale diagnostic testing and technology-based comprehensive contact tracing, have brought about debates among public health experts and medical professionals. This case study describes the major cluster transmissions in SARS-CoV-2 hotspots in South Korea (such as a religious sect, a call center, logistics facilities, and nightclubs) and offers early observations on how South Korean public health authorities acted in response to the initial outbreak of the virus and to the new waves prompted by re-opening economies. We then discuss the way in which South Korea's experience can act as a reference for shaping other countries' public health strategies in pandemic crisis management.

Economic, Mental Health, HIV Prevention and HIV Treatment Impacts of COVID-19 and the COVID-19 Response on a Global Sample of Cisgender Gay Men and Other Men Who Have Sex with Men

There is an urgent need to measure the impacts of COVID-19 among gay men and other men who have sex with men (MSM). We conducted a cross-sectional survey with a global sample of gay men and other MSM (n = 2732) from April 16, 2020 to May 4, 2020, through a social networking app. We characterized the economic, mental health, HIV prevention and HIV treatment impacts of COVID-19 and the COVID-19 response, and examined whether sub-groups of our study population are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Many gay men and other MSM not only reported economic and mental health consequences, but also interruptions to HIV prevention and testing, and HIV care and treatment services. These consequences were significantly greater among people living with HIV, racial/ethnic minorities, immigrants, sex workers, and socio-economically disadvantaged groups. These findings highlight the urgent need to mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 among gay men and other MSM.

Down-regulation of IL-8 expression in human airway epithelial cells through helper-dependent adenoviral-mediated RNA interference

Interleukin (IL)-8 is a potent neutrophil chemotactic factor and a crucial mediator in neutrophil-dependent inflammation. Various cell types produce IL-8, either in response to external stimuli such as cytokines or bacterial infection, or after malignant transformation. Anti-IL-8 strategies have been considered for anti-inflammatory therapy. In this paper we demonstrate that the RNA interference technique can be used to efficiently down-regulate IL-8 protein expression in airway epithelial cells. We used a helper-dependent adenoviral vector to express a small hairpin (sh)RNA targeting human IL-8 in cultured airway epithelial cells (IB3-1, Cftr(−/−); C38, Cftr-corrected) stimulated with TNF-α, IL-1β or heat-inactivated Burkholderia cenocepacia. Stimulated IL-8 expression in IB3-1 and C38 cells was significantly reduced by shRNA expression. The shRNA targeting IL-8 had no effect on the activation of NF-κB, or on the protein levels of IκB or IL-6, suggesting that this anti-IL-8 strategy was highly specific, and therefore may offer potential for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/sj.cr.7290275) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Could sudden sensorineural hearing loss be the sole manifestation of COVID-19? An investigation into SARS-COV-2 in the etiology of sudden sensorineural hearing loss

Abstract Objective The aim of this study is to investigate the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients presenting with only sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) during the pandemic. Methods The study included 5 male patients who presented with the sole complaint of unilateral SSNHL to the otolaryngology outpatient clinic between April 3 and April 12, 2020. The patients were referred to the infectious diseases clinic to be evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 by using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Results RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 were positive in one of the patient and negative in rest four patients. We also noted positive response to Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) specific treatment in SARS-CoV-2 positive SSNHL patient. Conclusion It should be kept in mind that non-specific symptoms such as SSNHL could be the only sign to recognize a COVID-19 case. Awareness of such a non-specific presentation of COVID-19 patients is crucial during this pandemic period for the prevention of infectious spread through isolation and early initiation of COVID-19 targeted treatment.

Emerging Structural Insights into Glycoprotein Quality Control Coupled with N-Glycan Processing in the Endoplasmic Reticulum

In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the sugar chain is initially introduced onto newly synthesized proteins as a triantennary tetradecasaccharide (Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2)). The attached oligosaccharide chain is subjected to stepwise trimming by the actions of specific glucosidases and mannosidases. In these processes, the transiently expressed N-glycans, as processing intermediates, function as signals for the determination of glycoprotein fates, i.e., folding, transport, or degradation through interactions of a series of intracellular lectins. The monoglucosylated glycoforms are hallmarks of incompletely folded states of glycoproteins in this system, whereas the outer mannose trimming leads to ER-associated glycoprotein degradation. This review outlines the recently emerging evidence regarding the molecular and structural basis of this glycoprotein quality control system, which is regulated through dynamic interplay among intracellular lectins, glycosidases, and glycosyltransferase. Structural snapshots of carbohydrate-lectin interactions have been provided at the atomic level using X-ray crystallographic analyses. Conformational ensembles of uncomplexed triantennary high-mannose-type oligosaccharides have been characterized in a quantitative manner using molecular dynamics simulation in conjunction with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These complementary views provide new insights into glycoprotein recognition in quality control coupled with N-glycan processing.

Transseptal ascending aortic access facilitates transcatheter embolization of proximal type I endoleak associated with bird-beak configuration of an endograft in the proximal aortic arch.

PURPOSE To report the initial use of antegrade transseptal ascending aortic access to perform transcatheter embolization of a proximal type I endoleak associated with bird-beak configuration of an endograft in the proximal aortic arch. CASE REPORT A 61-year-old man underwent endovascular repair of a large, symptomatic aortic arch aneurysm located distal to the left common carotid artery using a fenestrated endograft. Completion angiography showed bird-beak configuration of the proximal endograft and a large type Ia endoleak. In a separate procedure, the endoleak was embolized with cyanoacrylate glue via an antegrade ascending aortic access obtained through a transseptal sheath stabilized by an indwelling arteriovenous wire loop. This approach provided straight-line access into the endoleak with requisite catheter support, and complete thrombosis of the aneurysm sac was achieved. The patient's symptoms abated, and at 1-year follow-up, there was no endoleak, and the aneurysm sac had shrunken markedly. CONCLUSION Antegrade transseptal ascending aortic access facilitates transcatheter embolization of type Ia endoleak in the proximal aortic arch.

Rapid Direct Nucleic Acid Amplification Test without RNA Extraction for SARS-CoV-2 Using a Portable PCR Thermocycler.

There is an ongoing worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). At present, confirmatory diagnosis is by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), typically taking several hours and requiring a molecular laboratory to perform. There is an urgent need for rapid, simplified, and cost-effective detection methods. We have developed and analytically validated a protocol for direct rapid extraction-free PCR (DIRECT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for nucleic acid purification. As few as six RNA copies per reaction of viral nucleocapsid (N) gene from respiratory samples such as sputum and nasal exudate can be detected directly using our one-step inhibitor-resistant assay. The performance of this assay was validated on a commercially available portable PCR thermocycler. Viral lysis, reverse transcription, amplification, and detection are achieved in a single-tube homogeneous reaction within 36 min. This minimizes hands-on time, reduces turnaround-time for sample-to-result, and obviates the need for RNA purification reagents. It could enable wider use of Covid-19 testing for diagnosis, screening, and research in countries and regions where laboratory capabilities are limiting.

Recommendations for the management of patients with immune-mediated kidney disease during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created major challenges for all countries around the globe. Retrospective studies have identified hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and older age as risk factors for high morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. There is a general concern that patients with immune-mediated kidney diseases, namely those on immunosuppressive therapies and/or those with more advanced kidney failure, could particularly be at risk for adverse outcomes due to a compromised antiviral immunity. Uncertainties exist on how management routines should be reorganized to minimize the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and what measures are necessary for infected patients. The aim of the present review of the Immunonephrology Working Group of the European Renal Association–European Dialysis and Transplant Association is to provide recommendations for the management of patients with immune-mediated kidney diseases based on the available evidence, similar circumstances with other infectious organisms and expert opinions from across Europe. Such recommendations may help to minimize the risk of encountering COVID-19 or developing complications during COVID-19 in patients with immune-mediated kidney disease.

Serological evidence of coronavirus infection in mithuns (Bos frontalis) from India.

Studies conducted on mithuns at the National Research Centre on Mithun, and mithuns found in free-ranging conditions in Nagaland, India, revealed that the overall prevalence of antibodies to coronavirus was 80% (95% confidence interval [CI] 77-83) when detected by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The highest seroprevalence (92%; 95% CI 89-95) was found in mithuns above three years of age, and the lowest (53%; 95% CI 36-70) in mithuns of 7 to 12 months old (P = 0.00005). The study also revealed a higher degree of positivity (++++) in mithuns above three years old than in those below one year. No statistically significant difference in seroprevalence was observed between male (80%; 95% CI 75-85) and female mithuns (80%; 95% CI 76-84). The seroprevalence was found to be higher (92%; 95% CI 89-95) in mithuns reared in semi-intensive systems compared with those kept under free-ranging conditions (56%; 95% CI 49-63; P = 0.003). This is probably the first serological evidence of coronavirus infection in mithuns. The possible role of adults in the epidemiology of coronavirus infection in mithuns is also discussed.

Cyclophilin–CD147 interactions: a new target for anti-inflammatory therapeutics

CD147 is a widely expressed plasma membrane protein that has been implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological activities. It is best known for its ability to function as extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (hence the other name for this protein, EMMPRIN), but has also been shown to regulate lymphocyte responsiveness, monocarboxylate transporter expression and spermatogenesis. These functions reflect multiple interacting partners of CD147. Among these CD147-interacting proteins cyclophilins represent a particularly interesting class, both in terms of structural considerations and potential medical implications. CD147 has been shown to function as a signalling receptor for extracellular cyclophilins A and B and to mediate chemotactic activity of cyclophilins towards a variety of immune cells. Recent studies using in vitro and in vivo models have demonstrated a role for cyclophilin–CD147 interactions in the regulation of inflammatory responses in a number of diseases, including acute lung inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular disease. Agents targeting either CD147 or cyclophilin activity showed significant anti-inflammatory effects in experimental models, suggesting CD147–cyclophilin interactions may be a good target for new anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Here, we review the recent literature on different aspects of cyclophilin–CD147 interactions and their role in inflammatory diseases.

The “forgotten zone”: Acquired disorders of the trachea in adults

Summary The upper airway is generally defined as the air passage segment that extends between the naso- or oropharynx and the carina. The longest segment of the upper airway—the trachea—begins at the inferior portion of the larynx and extends to the branch point of the main carina. The trachea has the potential to be a “forgotten zone” in differential diagnoses, as pathological processes involving this portion may not receive prominent clinical consideration in disorders presenting with respiratory symptoms and signs. Unlike the oropharynx, this anatomical area is beyond visualization on routine inspection; unlike the mediastinum and lung fields, it is a potential “blind spot” on initial, plain radiographic examination of the chest. Nonetheless, the adult trachea is affected by a number of primary disorders and is also a target organ of a variety of systemic diseases. This review will focus on both primary and systemic diseases involving the adult trachea with specific attention to their clinical manifestations and diagnostic hallmarks.

heFFTe: Highly Efficient FFT for Exascale

Exascale computing aspires to meet the increasing demands from large scientific applications. Software targeting exascale is typically designed for heterogeneous architectures; henceforth, it is not only important to develop well-designed software, but also make it aware of the hardware architecture and efficiently exploit its power. Currently, several and diverse applications, such as those part of the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) in the United States, rely on efficient computation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In this context, we present the design and implementation of heFFTe (Highly Efficient FFT for Exascale) library, which targets the upcoming exascale supercomputers. We provide highly (linearly) scalable GPU kernels that achieve more than [Formula: see text] speedup with respect to local kernels from CPU state-of-the-art libraries, and over [Formula: see text] speedup for the whole FFT computation. A communication model for parallel FFTs is also provided to analyze the bottleneck for large-scale problems. We show experiments obtained on Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, using up to 24,576 IBM Power9 cores and 6,144 NVIDIA V-100 GPUs.

Discovery and Characterization of Novel Bat Coronavirus Lineages from Kazakhstan

Coronaviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses that infect a variety of hosts, resulting in a range of symptoms from gastrointestinal illness to respiratory distress. Bats are reservoirs for a high diversity of coronaviruses, and focused surveillance detected several strains genetically similar to MERS-coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus, and the human coronaviruses 229E and NL63. The bat fauna of central Asia, which link China to eastern Europe, are relatively less studied than other regions of the world. Kazakhstan is the world’s ninth largest country; however, little is understood about the prevalence and diversity of bat-borne viruses. In this study, bat guano was collected from bat caves in three different sites of southern Kazakhstan that tested positive for coronaviruses. Our phylogenetic reconstruction indicates these are novel bat coronaviruses that belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus. In addition, two distinct lineages of Kazakhstan bat coronaviruses were detected. Both lineages are closely related to bat coronaviruses from China, France, Spain, and South Africa, suggesting that co-circulation of coronaviruses is common in multiple bat species with overlapping geographical distributions. Our study highlights the need for collaborative efforts in understudied countries to increase integrated surveillance capabilities toward better monitoring and detection of infectious diseases.

Broad Antiviral Activity of Ginkgolic Acid against Chikungunya, Mayaro, Una, and Zika Viruses

The alphaviruses Chikungunya (CHIKV), Mayaro (MAYV), Una (UNAV), and the flavivirus Zika (ZIKV) are emerging or re-emerging arboviruses which are responsible for frequent epidemic outbreaks. Despite the large impact of these arboviruses on health systems, there are no approved vaccines or treatments to fight these infections. As a consequence, there is an urgent need to discover new antiviral drugs. Natural products are a rich source of compounds with distinct biological activities, including antiviral properties. Thus, we aimed to explore the potential antiviral activity of Ginkgolic acid against the arboviruses CHIKV, MAYV, UNAV, and ZIKV. Viral progeny production in supernatants from cells treated or not treated with Ginkgolic acid was quantified by plaque-forming assay. Ginkgolic acid’s direct virucidal activity against these arboviruses was also determined. Additionally, viral protein expression was assessed using Western blot and immunofluorescence. Our results reveal that Ginkgolic acid promotes a dose-dependent decrease in viral titers in all tested viruses. Moreover, the compound demonstrated strong virucidal activity. Finally, we found that viral protein expression was affected by treatment with this drug. Collectively, these findings suggest that Ginkgolic acid could have broader antiviral activity.

Development of a Phage Display Panning Strategy Utilizing Crude Antigens: Isolation of MERS-CoV Nucleoprotein human antibodies

Antibody phage display has been pivotal in the quest to generate human monoclonal antibodies for biomedical and research applications. Target antigen preparation is a main bottleneck associated with the panning process. This includes production complexity, downstream purification, quality and yield. In many instances, purified antigens are preferred for panning but this may not be possible for certain difficult target antigens. Here, we describe an improved procedure of affinity selection against crude or non-purified antigen by saturation of non-binders with blocking agents to promote positive binder enrichment termed as Yin-Yang panning. A naïve human scFv library with kappa light chain repertoire with a library size of 10(9) was developed. The improved Yin-Yang biopanning process was able to enrich monoclonal antibodies specific to the MERS-CoV nucleoprotein. Three unique monoclonal antibodies were isolated in the process. The Yin-Yang biopanning method highlights the possibility of utilizing crude antigens for the isolation of monoclonal antibodies by phage display.

Agricultural and geographic factors shaped the North American 2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N2 outbreak

The 2014–2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5NX outbreak represents the largest and most expensive HPAI outbreak in the United States to date. Despite extensive traditional and molecular epidemiological studies, factors associated with the spread of HPAI among midwestern poultry premises remain unclear. To better understand the dynamics of this outbreak, 182 full genome HPAI H5N2 sequences isolated from commercial layer chicken and turkey production premises were analyzed using evolutionary models able to accommodate epidemiological and geographic information. Epidemiological compartmental models embedded in a phylogenetic framework provided evidence that poultry type acted as a barrier to the transmission of virus among midwestern poultry farms. Furthermore, after initial introduction, the propagation of HPAI cases was self-sustainable within the commercial poultry industries. Discrete trait diffusion models indicated that within state viral transitions occurred more frequently than inter-state transitions. Distance and sample size were very strongly supported as associated with viral transition between county groups (Bayes Factor > 30.0). Together these findings indicate that the different types of midwestern poultry industries were not a single homogenous population, but rather, the outbreak was shaped by poultry industries and geographic factors.

Bovine coronavirus antigen in the host cell plasmalemma

Abstract Expression of bovine coronavirus (BCV) antigen in the plasmalemma of epithelioid human rectal tumor (HRT-18) and fibroblastic bovine fetal spleen (BFS) cell lines was traced by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy facilitated by colloidal gold. Cytoplasmic fluorescence was first observed at 12 hr postinfection (h.p.i) in infected HRT-18 cultures. This fluorescence coincided with the appearance of cell surface antigen reacting with colloidal gold-labeled antibodies to BCV antigens. At 24 h.p.i the amount of viral antigens at the surface of HRT-18 had increased, although cytoplasmic fluorescence remained constant. Infected BFS cells but not HRT-18 cells formed polykaryons when incubated in the presence of trypsin. One viral antigen in the plasma membrane of BFS cells was thus identified as the S glycoprotein with a fusion domain. In contrast to HRT-18 cells, the overall amount of BCV antigens at the surface of BFS cells remained constant after the onset of fusion. Analysis of the labeling characteristics established that the goldmarked-sites represented de novo expression of BCV antigen in the plasma membrane of infected cells.

Towards Improving Sample Representativeness of Teachers on Online Social Media: A Case Study on Pinterest

Many teachers utilize online social media to supplement their students’ needs and enhance their professional activities, curating millions of educational resources. In fact, during the Coronovirus pandemic, online curation of resources provides teachers a repository of materials to provide students in online space. Teachers’ engagement online then provides the ability to learn more about how teachers are addressing students’ learning needs and potentially improve the quality of the resources they share. Historically, to perform such a study, we often survey some teachers and then leverage their shared resources to investigate education-related research questions. However, this can lead to problems including sample representativeness where surveyed teachers may not be representative of the population of teachers in social media. In this paper, we attempt to improve the sample representativeness of teachers on Pinterest. We first survey 541 teachers in the United States as seed samples and then collect their online data and social connections on Pinterest. Then, we devise a heuristic that automatically identifies other Pinterest accounts that are likely to be teachers thus improving the sample representativeness. Finally, we evaluate our heuristic with advanced machine learning techniques.

On the derivation of the renewal equation from an age-dependent branching process: an epidemic modelling perspective

Renewal processes are a popular approach used in modelling infectious disease outbreaks. In a renewal process, previous infections give rise to future infections. However, while this formulation seems sensible, its application to infectious disease can be difficult to justify from first principles. It has been shown from the seminal work of Bellman and Harris that the renewal equation arises as the expectation of an age-dependent branching process. In this paper we provide a detailed derivation of the original Bellman Harris process. We introduce generalisations, that allow for time-varying reproduction numbers and the accounting of exogenous events, such as importations. We show how inference on the renewal equation is easy to accomplish within a Bayesian hierarchical framework. Using off the shelf MCMC packages, we fit to South Korea COVID-19 case data to estimate reproduction numbers and importations. Our derivation provides the mathematical fundamentals and assumptions underpinning the use of the renewal equation for modelling outbreaks.

Coronavirus Transcription Mediated by Sequences Flanking the Transcription Consensus Sequence

Abstract In our studies of murine coronavirus transcription, we continue to use defective interfering (DI) RNAs of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in which we insert a transcription consensus sequence in order to mimic subgenomic RNA synthesis from the nondefective genome. Using our subgenomic DI system, we have studied the effects of sequences flanking the MHV transcription consensus sequence on subgenomic RNA transcription. We obtained the following results. (i) Insertion of a 12-nucleotide-long sequence including the UCUAAAC transcription consensus sequence at different locations of the DI RNA resulted in different efficiencies of subgenomic DI RNA synthesis. (ii) Differences in the amount of subgenomic DI RNA were defined by the sequences that flanked the 12-nucleotide-long sequence and were not affected by the location of the 12-nucleotide-long sequence on the DI RNA. (iii) Naturally occurring flanking sequences of intergenic sequences at gene 6–7, but not at genes 1–2 and 2–3, contained a transcription suppressive element(s). (iv) Each of three naturally occurring flanking sequences of an MHV genomic cryptic transcription consensus sequence from MHV gene 1 also contained a transcription suppressive element(s). These data showed that sequences flanking the transcription consensus sequence affected MHV transcription.

Experimental inoculation of adult dairy cows with bovine coronavirus and detection of coronavirus in feces by RT-PCR

A reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) targeting a 407 bp fragment of the nucleocapsid gene of bovine coronavirus (BCV) was developed for detection of BCV RNA in feces of experimentally inoculated cattle. The sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR were confirmed using tissue culture-adapted BCV strains and feces of 2 calves inoculated with BCV. Ten nonpregant, BCV seropositive, adult dairy cows were inoculated with winter dysentery (WD) (n = 8) or calf diarrhea (CD) (n = 2) strains of BCV intranasally and orally (n = 2) or through a surgically-placed duodenal catheter (n = 8) with and without dexamethasone treatment or feeding ice water. The 6 cows inoculated with BCV intranasally and through a duodenal catheter (2 of 2 cows given CD BCV and 4 of 6 cows given WD BCV) developed mild diarrhea, and BCV was detected in diarrheal feces by RT-PCR, ELISA or immune electron microscopy. These results suggest that CD and WD strains of BCV can cause diarrhea in adult cows in conjunction with host or environmental factors and that RT-PCR might be useful to diagnose BCV infections in calves and adult cows.

A new approach to pleural effusion in cats: markers for distinguishing transudates from exudates

Classification of pleural effusion (PE) is central to diagnosis. Traditional veterinary classification has distinguished between transudates, modified transudates and exudates. In human medicine PEs are divided into only two categories: transudates and exudates. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in 20 cats presented with PE, paired samples of serum and pleural fluid for the following parameters: Light's criteria (pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase concentration (LDHp), pleural fluid/serum LDH ratio, pleural fluid/serum total protein ratio (TPr)), pleural fluid total protein, pleural fluid cholesterol concentration, pleural fluid/serum cholesterol ratio (CHOLr), serum-effusion cholesterol gradient (serum cholesterol minus PE cholesterol concentration (CHOLg)), PE total nucleated cells count (TNCCp) and pleural fluid glucose (GLUp). LDHp and TPr were found most reliable when distinguishing between transudates and exudates, with sensitivity of 100% and 91% and specificity of 100%, respectively. When conflict between the clinical picture and laboratory results exists, calculation of CHOLr, CHOLg and TNCCp measurement may help in the classification of the effusion. Measurement of serum albumin (in the case of a transudate) may provide additional information regarding the pathogenesis of the effusion.

Current epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19; a global perspective from China

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and represents a potentially fatal disease of great global public health importance. As of March 26, 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in 462,801 confirmed cases and 20,839 deaths globally, which is more than those caused by SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2003 and 2013, respectively. The epidemic has posed considerable challenges worldwide. Under a strict mechanism of massive prevention and control, China has seen a rapid decrease in new cases of coronavirus; however, the global situation remains serious. Additionally, the origin of COVID-19 has not been determined and no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine is currently available. Based on the published data, this review systematically discusses the etiology, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and current intervention measures related to COVID-19 in the hope that it may provide a reference for future studies and aid in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic.

Hemiarthroplasty in a patient with femoral neck fracture and pyoderma gangrenosum: a case report and review of the literature.

BACKGROUND Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare ulcerating skin disease of unknown etiology, making its coincidence with orthopedic trauma a rare challenge. Patients are at risk of progression of the existing lesions and development of new lesions upon skin injury when surgical procedures are performed. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature of disease unrelated surgery during active pyoderma gangrenosum. CASE PRESENTATION We present a case of femoral neck fracture in a Caucasian patient with concurrent pyoderma gangrenosum localized in the axilla. Hemiarthroplasty was safely performed after disease activity was reduced with systemic corticosteroids. Tissue-protective wound closure was used together with perioperative corticosteroids and antibiotics. No signs of pyoderma gangrenosum developed at the surgical wound site, and the axillary lesions showed constant improvement until healing with scar tissue. CONCLUSIONS In our patient, the preoperative steroid treatment, perioperative antibiotics, and soft tissue protective surgical technique led to successful management of this rare coincidence.

Siglecs at the Host–Pathogen Interface

Siglecs are sialic acid (Sia) recognizing immunoglobulin-like receptors expressed on the surface of all the major leukocyte lineages in mammals. Siglecs recognize ubiquitous Sia epitopes on various glycoconjugates in the cell glycocalyx and transduce signals to regulate immunological and inflammatory activities of these cells. The subset known as CD33-related Siglecs is principally inhibitory receptors that suppress leukocyte activation, and recent research has shown that a number of bacterial pathogens use Sia mimicry to engage these Siglecs as an immune evasion strategy. Conversely, Siglec-1 is a macrophage phagocytic receptor that engages GBS and other sialylated bacteria to promote effective phagocytosis and antigen presentation for the adaptive immune response, whereas certain viruses and parasites use Siglec-1 to gain entry to immune cells as a proximal step in the infectious process. Siglecs are positioned in crosstalk with other host innate immune sensing pathways to modulate the immune response to infection in complex ways. This chapter summarizes the current understanding of Siglecs at the host–pathogen interface, a field of study expanding in breadth and medical importance, and which provides potential targets for immune-based anti-infective strategies.

Physicochemical properties of transmissible gastroenteritis virus hemagglutinin

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus was readily adsorbed onto chicken erythrocytes at 4°C. The hemagglutinin thus adsorbed could be eluted from the erythrocytes by incubating in phosphate buffered saline at 37°C. The on chicken erythrocytes for the hemagglutinin was inactivated by neuraminidase and potassium periodate, but not by trypsin, 2-mercaptoethanol and formalin. The hemagglutinin was inactivated by trypsin, papain, pepsin, α-amylase, phospholipase C, neuraminidase, formalin, 2-mercaptoethanol, potassium periodate, ethylether, chloroform, Tween-80 and β-propiolactone, but not by sodium deoxycholate and trichlorotrifluoroethane, suggesting that the active component of the hemagglutinin involved glycoproteins. The hemagglutinin was stable at 37°C or lower temperatures but not at 60°C or higher temperatures. The hemagglutinin activity was resistant to ultraviolet irradiation, while the infectivity was very susceptible. The hemagglutinin and the infectivity were readily sedimented by ultracentrifugation at 45,000 × g for 60 minutes. In rate zonal centrifugation of the hemagglutinin preparation on a sucrose density gradient, the hemagglutinin activity showed a sharp peak at 1.19 g/ml coinciding with the peak of infectivity. The activity in the peak fraction seemed to be structually associated with virus particles.

Predictions of 2019-nCoV Transmission Ending via Comprehensive Methods

Since the SARS outbreak in 2003, a lot of predictive epidemiological models have been proposed. At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, termed as 2019-nCoV, has broken out and is propagating in China and the world. Here we propose a multi-model ordinary differential equation set neural network (MMODEs-NN) and model-free methods to predict the interprovincial transmissions in mainland China, especially those from Hubei Province. Compared with the previously proposed epidemiological models, the proposed network can simulate the transportations with the ODEs activation method, while the model-free methods based on the sigmoid function, Gaussian function, and Poisson distribution are linear and fast to generate reasonable predictions. According to the numerical experiments and the realities, the special policies for controlling the disease are successful in some provinces, and the transmission of the epidemic, whose outbreak time is close to the beginning of China Spring Festival travel rush, is more likely to decelerate before February 18 and to end before April 2020. The proposed mathematical and artificial intelligence methods can give consistent and reasonable predictions of the 2019-nCoV ending. We anticipate our work to be a starting point for comprehensive prediction researches of the 2019-nCoV.

Association between congenital defects in papillary outgrowth and functional obstruction in Crim1 mutant mice.

Crim1 hypomorphic (Crim1(KST264/KST264)) mice display progressive renal disease characterized by glomerular defects, leaky peritubular vasculature, and progressive interstitial fibrosis. Here we show that 27% of these mice also present with hydronephrosis, suggesting obstructive nephropathy. Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging using Magnevist showed fast development of hypo-intense signal in the kidneys of Crim1(KST264/KST264) mice, suggesting pooling of filtrate within the renal parenchyma. Rhodamine dextran (10 kDa) clearance was also delayed in Crim1(KST264/KST264) mice. Pyeloureteric peristalsis, while present, was less co-ordinated in Crim1(KST264/KST264) mice. However, isolated renal pelvis preparations suggest normal pelvic smooth muscle contractile responses. An analysis of maturation during the immediate postnatal period [postnatal day (P) 0-15] revealed defects in papillary extension in Crim1({KST264/KST264) mice. While Crim1 expression is weak in pelvic smooth muscle, strong expression is seen in the interstitium and loops of Henle of the extending papilla, commencing at the tip of the P1 papilla and disseminating throughout the papilla by P15. These results, as well as implicating Crim1 in papillary extension and pelvic smooth muscle contractility, highlight the previously unrecognized association between defects in papillary development and progression to chronic kidney disease later in life.

Coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus non-structural proteins 8 and 12 form stable complex independent of the non-translated regions of viral RNA and other viral proteins

Abstract The cleavage products from coronavirus polyproteins, known as the non-structural proteins (nsps), are believed to make up the major components of the viral replication/transcription complex. In this study, several nsps encoded by avian gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were screened for RNA-binding activity and interaction with its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, nsp12. Nsp2, nsp5, nsp8, nsp9 and nsp10 were found to bind to untranslated regions (UTRs), while nsp8 was confirmed to interact with nsp12. Nsp8 has been reported to interact with nsp7 and functions as a primase synthesizing RNA primers for nsp12. Further characterization revealed that nsp8-nsp12 interaction is independent of the UTRs of viral RNA, and nsp8 interacts with both the N- and C-terminal regions of nsp12. These results have prompted a proposal of how the nsp7-nsp8 complex could possibly function in tandem with nsp12, forming a highly efficient complex that could synthesize both the RNA primer and viral RNA during coronavirus infection.

Recombinant protein‐based ELISA and immuno‐cytochemical assay for the diagnosis of SARS

A new Coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) is the aetiological agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Because of the critical role played by serological assays for SARS diagnosis, an in‐house ELISA based on SARS‐CoV recombinant antigens was developed. The SARS‐CoV nucleocapsid protein (N), three N fragments (N1, N2, and N3) and the intraviral domain of the membrane protein (M2) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as histidine‐tagged proteins. Six reference sera from SARS patients were used to detect virus‐specific IgG in an ELISA using each recombinant protein as coating antigen. High‐titre positive reactions were detected in all SARS positive sera. The specificity of the assay appears to be high as no positive reaction was detected in the sera of 20 healthy subjects and 73 patients with non‐SARS, low‐tract respiratory infections. Specific hyper‐immune sera to SARS‐CoV and the recombinant proteins, N, N1, N2, N3, and M2 were also generated in mice and rabbits. The specificity of these sera was confirmed by an immunocytochemical assay on biochips of SARS‐CoV infected and uninfected cells. J. Med. Virol. 76:137–142, 2005. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Basic concepts in the use of thoracic and lung ultrasound.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW Recent advances were made in the field of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). Thoracic and lung ultrasound have become a rapid and accurate method of diagnosis of hypoxic diseases. The purpose of this article is to review the recent literature on POCUS, emphasizing on its use in the operating room. RECENT FINDINGS Many international critical care societies published guidelines on the use of ultrasound in the installation of central venous access. More recently, evidenced-based guidelines on the use of POC lung ultrasound were published. Lung ultrasound has shown its superiority over conventional chest radiography in the diagnosis of many disorders of significant importance in anesthesiology, particularly the pneumothorax. SUMMARY POC thoracic and lung ultrasound is used in many critical medicine fields. The aim of this review is to describe the basic lung ultrasound technique and the knowledge required in order to diagnose and treat the hypoxic patient. Emphasis is on disorder such as pleural effusion, alveolar interstitial disease, as well as pneumothorax, which is of particular importance in the field of anesthesiology.

Computed tomography findings in a case of coronavirus disease 2019

Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is mainly characterized by pulmonary inflammation. The preferred imaging modality is chest computed tomography (CT) which plays an important role in early diagnosis, quarantine, and treatment as well as in the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. We report the imaging data from a confirmed case of COVID-19 admitted to our hospital. Our aims are to improve understanding of this disease and to facilitate early diagnosis and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. A 70-year-old woman living in the epidemic area presented with a 2-day history of intermittent fever. Chest CT revealed multiple ground glass opacities in both lungs, mainly distributed subpleurally and in the middle and lateral lung fields, particularly in the right lung, where they had partially fused into patches. Local interlobular septal thickening was also observed. Throat swabs were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, which confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest CT plays a key role in the diagnosis of COVID-19, providing an accurate diagnosis and is a sensitive technique for evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. It has the advantages of promptness, convenience, and high efficiency.

Reoperation for pelvic organ prolapse within 10 years of primary surgery for prolapse.

INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS A presumed high failure rate of conventional procedures for prolapse has been part of the rationale for new surgical approaches. The aim of the present retrospective cohort study was to estimate the reoperation rate for prolapse within 10 years of primary surgery for prolapse. METHODS We identified all patients who underwent primary surgery for prolapse at four large regional centers in Austria in 1997 and 1998. Hospital databases were searched to determine whether patients had been reoperated for prolapse through 2008. RESULTS A total of 456 patients underwent a primary operation for prolapse in 1997 and 1998. The most common primary operation was vaginal hysterectomy with colporrhaphy (89 %). We identified 13 reoperations for prolapse, for a 10-year reoperation rate of (at least) 2.9 %. The median interval between primary and secondary surgery was 5.5 years (range 1.5-10 years). CONCLUSION The reoperation rate for prolapse after primary vaginal hysterectomy and colporrhaphy appears to be modest in this series of patients.

Pathogen-directed therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are important events in the natural history of this chronic lung disorder. These events can be caused by a large number of infectious and noninfectious agents and are associated with an increased local and systemic inflammatory response. Their frequency and severity have been linked to progressive deterioration in lung function and health status. Infectious pathogens ranging from viral to atypical and typical bacteria have been implicated in the majority of episodes. Most therapeutic regimens to date have emphasized broad, nonspecific approaches to bronchoconstriction and pulmonary inflammation. Increasingly, therapy that targets specific etiologic pathogens has been advocated. These include clinical and laboratory-based methods to identify bacterial infections. Further additional investigation has suggested specific pathogens within this broad class. As specific antiviral therapies become available, better diagnostic approaches to identify specific pathogens will be required. Furthermore, prophylactic therapy for at-risk individuals during high-risk times may become a standard therapeutic approach. As such, the future will likely include aggressive diagnostic algorithms based on the combination of clinical syndromes and rapid laboratory modalities to identify specific causative bacteria or viruses.

Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus strains with Higher Virulence Cause Marked Protein Profile Changes in MARC-145 Cells

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome is an infectious disease that causes serious economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. To better understand the pathogenesis of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), three PRRSV strains with different molecular markers and virulence were used to infect MARC-145 cells. A total of 1804 proteins were identified, and 233 altered proteins and 72 signaling pathways involved in the proteomic profiling of virus-infected MARC-145 cells increased with the virulence of the PRRSV strain. The three types of viral strains shared a common pathway—the electron transport reaction in mitochondria—in the infected-MARC-145 cells. Moreover, the antisense pathway was the most variable of all significant signaling pathways for the highly virulent SX-1 strain, indicating that this unique pathway may be connected to the high virulence of the SX-1 strain. Our study is the first attempt to provide a proteome profile of MARC-145 cells infected with PRRSV strains with different virulence, and these findings will facilitate a deep understanding of the interactions between this virus and its host.

Respiratory infections and lung function in an Australian Aboriginal community

Background and objective: To investigate the association between serological evidence of past infections with common respiratory pathogens and lung function in members of an isolated community of Aborigines from tropical coastal north‐western Australia. Methods: FEV(1) and FVC were assessed by dry bellows spirometer. Serum IgG titres to 11 common respiratory pathogens were assayed. Smoking history was assessed by questionnaire. Reciprocal positive IgG titres were taken as ≥10 for all pathogens with the exception of Legionella spp. (≥40) and Burkholderia pseudomallei (≥20). Linear regression analysis examined associations between titres and lung function after adjustment for age, height, gender and smoking, separately for adults (age > 17 years) and children. Results: An increased total number of positive IgG titres was significantly associated with reduced FEV(1) (P = 0.01) and FEV(1)/FVC ratio (P = 0.01) suggesting the presence of airflow obstruction. This association was independent of age, gender, height, weight and smoking status. Conclusions: The burden of past respiratory infections may be an important determinant of airway function in this Aboriginal community.

Putting Attacks in Context: A Building Automation Testbed for Impact Assessment from the Victim’s Perspective

Cybersecurity research relies on the reproducibility and deep understanding of attacks to devise appropriate solutions. Different kinds of testbeds are typically used to systematically execute attacks and evaluate defenses. Testbeds are widely used to demonstrate Building Automation and Control System (BACS) attacks and defenses, considered too risky to be executed on real infrastructures. However, those testbeds implement arbitrary configurations of building services that do not resemble real-world deployments. In this work, we present the first BACS testbed specially designed to assess the impact of cyberattacks from the victim’s perspective. It features general purpose building services such as illumination, ventilation, and temperature control, whose configuration is easily adapted to emulate the requirements of real-world locations. In this way, the context added to our testbed allows us to better understand the impact of BACS attacks through concrete and realistic scenarios. Moreover, by analyzing different configurations of the BACS (i.e., contexts), we found out that identical attacks may have dramatically different impacts. Thus, reinforcing our view on the relevance of adding context to BACS testbeds.

Interaction of cationic carbosilane dendrimers and their complexes with siRNA with erythrocytes and red blood cell ghosts

Abstract We have investigated the interactions between cationic NN16 and BDBR0011 carbosilane dendrimers with red blood cells or their cell membranes. The carbosilane dendrimers used possess 16 cationic functional groups. Both the dendrimers are made of water-stable carbon–silicon bonds, but NN16 possesses some oxygen–silicon bonds that are unstable in water. The nucleic acid used in the experiments was targeted against GAG-1 gene from the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV-1. By binding to the outer leaflet of the membrane, carbosilane dendrimers decreased the fluidity of the hydrophilic part of the membrane but increased the fluidity of the hydrophobic interior. They induced hemolysis, but did not change the morphology of the cells. Increasing concentrations of dendrimers induced erythrocyte aggregation. Binding of short interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) to a dendrimer molecule decreased the availability of cationic groups and diminished their cytotoxicity. siRNA–dendrimer complexes changed neither the fluidity of biological membranes nor caused cell hemolysis. Addition of dendriplexes to red blood cell suspension induced echinocyte formation.

Can SARS-CoV-2-infected women breastfeed after viral clearance?

The recently emerged novel coronavirus pneumonia, named the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), shares several clinical characteristics with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and spread rapidly throughout China in December of 2019 (Huang et al., 2020). The pathogen 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is now named SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is highly infectious. As of Apr. 9, 2020, over 80 000 confirmed cases had been reported, with an estimated mortality rate of 4.0% (Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Person-to-person transmission and familial clustering have been reported (Chan et al., 2020; Nishiura et al., 2020; Phan et al., 2020). However, there is no evidence of fetal intrauterine infection in pregnant women who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in their third trimester (Chen et al., 2020). It is unclear whether breastfeeding transmits the virus from previously infected and recovered mothers to their babies. Here we report the clinical course of a pregnant woman with COVID-19. In order to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to newborns through breastfeeding, we measured viral RNA in the patient's breastmilk samples at different time points after delivery.

A scoping review of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on surgical practice

BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the infrastructure of the healthcare systems. To cope with the pandemic, substantial changes were introduced to surgical practice and education all over the world. METHODS: A scoping search in PubMed and Google scholar was done using the search terms: “Coronavirus,” “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “nCoV-2019”, and “surgery.” They were either searched individually or in combination. All relevant articles of any study design (published within December 15, 2019, till the mid of June 2020), was included and narratively discussed in this review. RESULTS: Sixty-six articles were reviewed in this article. Through these articles, we provide guidance and recommendations on the preoperative preparation and safety precautions, intraoperative precautions, postoperative precautions, postoperative complications (related to COVID-19), surgical scheduling, emergency surgeries, elective surgeries, cancer surgery, psychological impact on surgical teams, and surgical training during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly all aspects of surgical procedures, scheduling, and staffing. Special precautions were taken before, during, or after surgeries. New treatment and teaching modalities emerged in response to the pandemic. Psychological support and training platforms are necessary for the surgical team.

[Hypothesis on generating and tracer gas study regarding transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome through ventilation system in a general hospital].

OBJECTIVE By measuring airflow and ventilation distribution of ward building, to explore and verify the hypothesis of airborne transmission and risk factor of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) nosocomial infection. METHODS Tracer gas (perfume of plant oil) was emitted to the bathroom of wards when SARS index patient lived. Six different experimental situations were designed to control the status of exhaust fan in bathrooms, exhaust fan in the top of building and fresh air exchange system. The concentration of perfume was separately measured by 4 groups of lab workers and recorded blindly by the scores of "tenth degree". RESULTS Tracer gas was detected from the wards of 8th to 13th floor. CONCLUSION Architecture and ventilation system of the inpatient building in the hospital contributed to the aerodynamic condition of SARS nosocomial infection through airborne transmission. The distribution of tracer gas in the wards was associated with SARS patients in this building. It was possible that SARS could have been transmitted to for distance by aerosol or other carriers.

A non-parametric Hawkes process model of primary and secondary accidents on a UK smart motorway

A self-exciting spatio-temporal point process is fitted to incident data from the UK National Traffic Information Service to model the rates of primary and secondary accidents on the M25 motorway in a 12-month period during 2017-18. This process uses a background component to represent primary accidents, and a self-exciting component to represent secondary accidents. The background consists of periodic daily and weekly components, a spatial component and a long-term trend. The self-exciting components are decaying, unidirectional functions of space and time. These components are determined via kernel smoothing and likelihood estimation. Temporally, the background is stable across seasons with a daily double peak structure reflecting commuting patterns. Spatially, there are two peaks in intensity, one of which becomes more pronounced during the study period. Self-excitation accounts for 6-7% of the data with associated time and length scales around 100 minutes and 1 kilometre respectively. In-sample and out-of-sample validation are performed to assess the model fit. When we restrict the data to incidents that resulted in large speed drops on the network, the results remain coherent.

Implementing wildlife disease surveillance in the Netherlands, a One Health approach.

The surveillance of (emerging) wildlife diseases can provide important, objective evidence of the circulation of pathogens of interest for veterinary and/or public health. The involvement of multiple research institutions in wildlife disease surveillance can ensure the best use of existing knowledge and expertise, but can also complicate or add challenges to the integration of wildlife disease surveillance components into a national programme. Documenting the existing efforts in a country's surveillance of wildlife diseases, including the institutes in which it takes place, provides a basis for policy-makers and authorities to identify gaps and priorities in their current surveillance programmes. This paper describes the wildlife disease surveillance activities taking place in the Netherlands. The authors recommend that, in addition to funding these current activities, surveillance resources should be allocated with the flexibility to allow for additional targeted surveillance, to detect and adequately respond to newly introduced or emerging pathogens. Similar structured overviews of wildlife disease surveillance in other countries would be very useful to facilitate international collaboration.

Description Logics with Concrete Domains and General Concept Inclusions Revisited

Concrete domains have been introduced in the area of Description Logic to enable reference to concrete objects (such as numbers) and predefined predicates on these objects (such as numerical comparisons) when defining concepts. Unfortunately, in the presence of general concept inclusions (GCIs), which are supported by all modern DL systems, adding concrete domains may easily lead to undecidability. One contribution of this paper is to strengthen the existing undecidability results further by showing that concrete domains even weaker than the ones considered in the previous proofs may cause undecidability. To regain decidability in the presence of GCIs, quite strong restrictions, in sum called [Formula: see text]-admissibility, need to be imposed on the concrete domain. On the one hand, we generalize the notion of [Formula: see text]-admissibility from concrete domains with only binary predicates to concrete domains with predicates of arbitrary arity. On the other hand, we relate [Formula: see text]-admissibility to well-known notions from model theory. In particular, we show that finitely bounded, homogeneous structures yield [Formula: see text]-admissible concrete domains. This allows us to show [Formula: see text]-admissibility of concrete domains using existing results from model theory.

Proteomic Profiling in Biracial Cohorts Implicates DC-SIGN as a Mediator of Genetic Risk in COVID-19

COVID-19 is one of the most consequential pandemics in the last century, yet the biological mechanisms that confer disease risk are incompletely understood. Further, heterogeneity in disease outcomes is influenced by race, though the relative contributions of structural/social and genetic factors remain unclear. Very recent unpublished work has identified two genetic risk loci that confer greater risk for respiratory failure in COVID-19: the ABO locus and the 3p21.31 locus. To understand how these loci might confer risk and whether this differs by race, we utilized proteomic profiling and genetic information from three cohorts including black and white participants to identify proteins influenced by these loci. We observed that variants in the ABO locus are associated with levels of CD209/DC-SIGN, a known binding protein for SARS-CoV and other viruses, as well as multiple inflammatory and thrombotic proteins, while the 3p21.31 locus is associated with levels of CXCL16, a known inflammatory chemokine. Thus, integration of genetic information and proteomic profiling in biracial cohorts highlights putative mechanisms for genetic risk in COVID-19 disease.

Vaginal Anatomy on MRI: New Information Obtained Using Distention.

OBJECTIVES To demonstrate and confirm the presence of three anatomic zones of the vagina (a superficial sphincteric zone; a central wedge shaped transition zone; and a deep, expanded forniceal zone) using pelvic magnetic resonance imaging with contrast distention of the vagina. METHODS A total of 107 consecutive female pelvic magnetic resonance imaging scans using vaginal contrast distention were retrospectively reviewed. The images were observed for the three-zone configuration. Anteroposterior and transverse diameter measurements were taken in the proximal, mid, and distal sphincteric, transition, and forniceal zones. Means and standard deviations were calculated at each site. Adjacent sites were compared using paired t tests. RESULTS The three-zone configuration was observed in all of the cases but one. Statistically significant increases and decreases of mean anteroposterior diameters occurred at all levels expected by visual observation. CONCLUSIONS The three-zone configuration of the distended vagina was confirmed by this study. The configuration of the vagina is more complex than has been reported previously. This configuration may facilitate parturition and may be useful in the design of intravaginal devices.

Chapter 101 Middle Ear and Eustachian Tube Mucosal Immunology

Abstract Mucosal immune responses within the middle ear and eustachian tube generally provide an effective and efficient response to the presence of microbial pathogens, with approximately 80% of clinically recognizable middle ear infections resolved within 7days. Particularly for young children aged less than 3years of age, the proximity and direct connection of the middle ear, via the eustachian tube, to the nasopharynx provide increased risk of commensal bacteria and upper respiratory tract viruses infecting the middle ear. Mucosal immunological defense in the middle ear and eustachian tube utilizes a number of mechanisms, including physicochemical barriers of mucus and the mucosal epithelial cells and innate immune responses such as inflammation, cellular infiltration, effusion, and antimicrobial protein secretions, in addition to adaptive host immune responses. Recent advances in otopathogen recognition via microbial pattern recognition receptors and elucidation of complex signaling cascades have improved understanding of the coordination and regulation of the middle ear mucosal response. These advances support vaccine development aiming to reduce the risk of otitis media in children.

Stabilizing the Closed SARS-CoV-2 Spike Trimer

The trimeric spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary focus of most vaccine design and development efforts. Due to intrinsic instability typical of class I fusion proteins, S tends to prematurely refold to the post-fusion conformation, compromising immunogenic properties and prefusion trimer yields. To support ongoing vaccine development efforts, we report the structure-based design of soluble S trimers, with increased yields and stabilities, based on introduction of single point mutations and disulfide-bridges. We identify two regions in the S-protein critical for the protein’s stability: the heptad repeat region 1 of the S2 subunit and subunit domain 1 at the interface with S2. We combined a minimal selection of mostly interprotomeric mutations to create a stable S-closed variant with a 6.4-fold higher expression than the parental construct while no longer containing a heterologous trimerization domain. The cryo-EM structure reveals a correctly folded, predominantly closed pre-fusion conformation. Highly stable and well producing S protein and the increased understanding of S protein structure will support vaccine development and serological diagnostics.

Harnessing DNA Synthesis to Develop Rapid Responses to Emerging and Pandemic Pathogens

Given the interconnected nature of our world today, emerging pathogens and pandemic outbreaks are an ever-growing threat to the health and economic stability of the global community. This is evident by the recent 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, the SARS outbreak, as well as the ever-present threat of global bioterrorism. Fortunately, the biomedical community has been able to rapidly generate sequence data so these pathogens can be readily identified. To date, however, the utilization of this sequence data to rapidly produce relevant experimental results or actionable treatments is lagging in spite of obtained sequence data. Thus, a pathogenic threat that has emerged and/or developed into a pandemic can be rapidly identified; however, translating this identification into a targeted therapeutic or treatment that is rapidly available has not yet materialized. This commentary suggests that the growing technology of DNA synthesis should be fully implemented as a means to rapidly generate in vivo data and possibly actionable therapeutics soon after sequence data becomes available.

Guidelines, law, and governance: disconnects in the global control of airline-associated infectious diseases

Summary International air travel is increasingly affecting the epidemiology of infectious diseases. A particular public health, economic, and political concern is the role of air travel in bringing infectious passengers or vectors to previously non-endemic areas. Yet, little research has been done to investigate either the infection risks associated with air travel or the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of infection control measures on aircraft and at borders. We briefly review the interface between international and national legislation, policy, and guidelines in the context of existing infection risks and possible scenarios. We have found that public health guidance and legislation, which airlines are required to follow, are often contradictory and confusing. Infection control measures for air travel need to be underpinned by coherent and enforceable national and international legislation that is based on solid epidemiological evidence. We recommend further research investment into more effective on-board vector control, health screening, and risk communications strategies, and the development of enforceable and harmonised international legislation.

Best practices in ranking communicable disease threats: a literature review, 2015.

The threat of serious, cross-border communicable disease outbreaks in Europe poses a significant challenge to public health and emergency preparedness because the relative likelihood of these threats and the pathogens involved are constantly shifting in response to a range of changing disease drivers. To inform strategic planning by enabling effective resource allocation to manage the consequences of communicable disease outbreaks, it is useful to be able to rank and prioritise pathogens. This paper reports on a literature review which identifies and evaluates the range of methods used for risk ranking. Searches were performed across biomedical and grey literature databases, supplemented by reference harvesting and citation tracking. Studies were selected using transparent inclusion criteria and underwent quality appraisal using a bespoke checklist based on the AGREE II criteria. Seventeen studies were included in the review, covering five methodologies. A narrative analysis of the selected studies suggests that no single methodology was superior. However, many of the methods shared common components, around which a 'best-practice' framework was formulated. This approach is intended to help inform decision makers' choice of an appropriate risk-ranking study design.

Mitochondrial location of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3b protein.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a distant member of the Group 2 coronaviruses, has recently been identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The genome of SARS-CoV contains four structural genes that are homologous to genes found in other coronaviruses, as well as six subgroup-specific open reading frames (ORFs). ORF3 encodes a predicted 154-amino-acid protein that lacks similarity to any known protein, and is designated 3b in this article. We reported previously that SARS-CoV 3b is predominantly localized in the nucleolus, and induces G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis in transfected cells. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV 3b fused with EGFP at its N- or C- terminus co-localized with a mitochondria-specific marker in some transfected cells. Mutation analysis of SARS-CoV 3b revealed that the domain spanning amino acids 80 to 138 was essential for its mitochondria localization. These results provide new directions for studies of the role of SARS-CoV 3b protein in SARS pathogenesis.

Internal Carotid Artery Dissection in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

Carotid artery dissection is a significant cause of stroke in young patients. It may be asymptomatic and go undiagnosed, or minimal transient manifestations may follow, commanding a higher index of suspicion than ordinarily exists to avoid misdiagnosis. Reported herein is a 27-year-old man who suffered extracranial internal carotid artery dissection while practicing a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu submission maneuver. The patient's condition suddenly deteriorated one week later due to distal embolization and stroke. Despite endovascular treatment, with stenting of the cervical carotid artery, neurologic deficits remained. Of note, the objective in martial arts, which is to kill or incapacitate, has yet to be fully tempered in transitioning to sport. Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, a relatively new and fast-growing form of martial art, places emphasis on submission maneuvers. Related injuries are not common knowledge and are poorly described in the literature. This account is intended to shed light on the risk of this discipline. Through education and improved supervision, vascular injuries of this nature and the potentially lethal or disabling consequences may thus be prevented in young athletes.

Fear of Ebola: The Influence of Collectivism on Xenophobic Threat Responses.

In response to the Ebola scare in 2014, many people evinced strong fear and xenophobia. The present study, informed by the pathogen-prevalence hypothesis, tested the influence of individualism and collectivism on xenophobic response to the threat of Ebola. A nationally representative sample of 1,000 Americans completed a survey, indicating their perceptions of their vulnerability to Ebola, ability to protect themselves from Ebola (protection efficacy), and xenophobic tendencies. Overall, the more vulnerable people felt, the more they exhibited xenophobic responses, but this relationship was moderated by individualism and collectivism. The increase in xenophobia associated with increased vulnerability was especially pronounced among people with high individualism scores and those with low collectivism scores. These relationships were mediated by protection efficacy. State-level collectivism had the same moderating effect on the association between perceived vulnerability and xenophobia that individual-level value orientation did. Collectivism-and the set of practices and rituals associated with collectivistic cultures-may serve as psychological protection against the threat of disease.

Programmed translational frameshifting.

Errors that alter the reading frame occur extremely rarely during translation, yet some genes have evolved sequences that efficiently induce frameshifting. These sequences, termed programmed frameshift sites, manipulate the translational apparatus to promote non-canonical decoding. Frameshifts are mechanistically diverse. Most cause a -1 shift of frames; the first such site was discovered in a metazoan retrovirus, but they are now known to be dispersed quite widely among evolutionarily diverse species. +1 frameshift sites are much less common, but again dispersed widely. The rarest form are the translational hop sites which program the ribosome to bypass a region of several dozen nucleotides. Each of these types of events are stimulated by distinct mechanisms. All of the events share a common phenomenology in which the programmed frameshift site causes the ribosome to pause during elongation so that the kinetically unfavorable alternative decoding event can occur. During this pause most frameshifts occur because one or more ribosome-bound tRNAs slip between cognate or near-cognate codons. However, even this generalization is not entirely consistent, since some frameshifts occur without slippage. Because of their similarity to rarer translational errors, programmed frameshift sites provide a tool with which to probe the mechanism of frame maintenance.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA extraction using magnetic beads for rapid large-scale testing by RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP

Rapid large-scale testing is essential for controlling the ongoing pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The standard diagnostic pipeline for testing SARS-CoV-2 presence in patients with an ongoing infection is predominantly based on pharyngeal swabs, from which the viral RNA is extracted using commercial kits followed by reverse transcription and quantitative PCR detection. As a result of the large demand for testing, commercial RNA extraction kits may be limited and alternative, non-commercial protocols are needed. Here, we provide a magnetic bead RNA extraction protocol that is predominantly based on in-house made reagents and is performed in 96-well plates supporting large-scale testing. Magnetic bead RNA extraction was benchmarked against the commercial QIAcube extraction platform. Comparable viral RNA detection sensitivity and specificity were obtained by fluorescent and colorimetric RT-LAMP using N primers, as well as RT-qPCR using E gene primers showing that the here presented RNA extraction protocol can be combined with a variety of detection methods at high throughput. Importantly, the presented diagnostic workflow can be quickly set up in a laboratory without access to an automated pipetting robot.

Procyanidin B1 purified from Cinnamomi cortex suppresses hepatitis C virus replication.

BACKGROUND A combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin is the current standard therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but this combination provides relatively low efficacy, especially in some patients with HCV genotype 1 infection; therefore, the development of novel therapeutic agents is required for further improvement in the treatment of chronic HCV infection. METHODS HCV pseudotype and subgenomic replicon assays were used in this study. The interaction of compounds with HCV receptors was examined using flow cytometry. Intracellular RNA levels were determined by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. RESULTS Procyanidin B1 (PB1), a dimer of (-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin, purified from Cinnamomi cortex, inhibits infection by vesicular stomatitis virus and HCV pseudotype virus in Huh-7 cells, with 50% effective concentrations of 29 and 15 microM, respectively. No inhibitory effects were observed in each component of PB1. We found that PB1 does not interfere with viral entry or receptor expression, but inhibits HCV RNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that PB1 suppresses HCV RNA synthesis, possibly as a HCV RNA polymerase inhibitor. Our results might contribute towards the development of more effective inhibitors for HCV infection from natural plants.

COVID-19 Pandemic: What Every Otolaryngologist-Head and Neck Surgeon Needs to Know for Safe Airway Management.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has unfolded with remarkable speed, posing unprecedented challenges for health care systems and society. Otolaryngologists have a special role in responding to this crisis by virtue of expertise in airway management. Against the backdrop of nations struggling to contain the virus's spread and to manage hospital strain, otolaryngologists must partner with anesthesiologists and front-line health care teams to provide expert services in high-risk situations while reducing transmission. Airway management and airway endoscopy, whether awake or sedated, expose operators to infectious aerosols, posing risks to staff. This commentary provides background on the outbreak, highlights critical considerations around mitigating infectious aerosol contact, and outlines best practices for airway-related clinical decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic. What otolaryngologists need to know and what actions are required are considered alongside the implications of increasing demand for tracheostomy. Approaches to managing the airway are presented, emphasizing safety of patients and the health care team.

COVID-19 and Reproductive Justice in Great Britain and the United States: Ensuring Access to Abortion Care during a Global Pandemic

In this paper we consider the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on access to abortion care in Great Britain (England, Wales, and Scotland) and the United States. The pandemic has exacerbated problems in access to abortion services because social distancing or lockdown measures, increasing caring responsibilities, and the need to self-isolate are making clinics much more difficult to access; and this is when clinics are able to stay open which many are not. In response we argue there is a need to facilitate telemedical early medical abortion in order to ensure access to essential healthcare for people in need of terminations. There are substantial legal barriers to the establishment of telemedical abortion services in parts of Great Britain and parts of the United States. We argue that during a pandemic any restriction on telemedicine for basic healthcare is an unjustifiable human rights violation and, in the United States, is unconstitutional.

Hyaluronic acid gel injection to prevent thermal injury of adjacent gastrointestinal tract during percutaneous liver radiofrequency ablation.

This study evaluated the safety, feasibility, and clinical utility of hyaluronic acid gel injection to separate the gastrointestinal tract from the tumor during liver radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Eleven patients with liver tumors measuring 0.9-3.5 cm (mean ± standard deviation, 2.1 ± 0.8 cm) that were adjacent to the gastrointestinal tracts received RFA after the mixture of hyaluronic acid gel and contrast material (volume, 26.4 ± 14.5 mL; range, 10-60 mL) was injected between the tumor and the gastrointestinal tract under computed tomographic-fluoroscopic guidance. Each tumor was separated from the gastrointestinal tract by 1.0-1.5 cm (distance, 1.2 ± 0.2 cm) after injection of hyaluronic acid gel, and subsequent RFA was performed without any complications in all patients. Although tumor enhancement disappeared in all patients, local tumor progression was found in a patient (9.1%, 1 of 11) during the follow-up of 5.5 ± 3.2 months (range, 0.4-9.9 months). In conclusion, hyaluronic acid gel injection is a safe and useful technique to avoid thermal injury of the adjacent gastrointestinal tract during liver RFA.

Descriptive distribution and phylogenetic analysis of feline infectious peritonitis virus isolates of Malaysia

The descriptive distribution and phylogeny of feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) were studied in cats suspected of having feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in Malaysia. Ascitic fluids and/or biopsy samples were subjected to a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeted for a conserved region of 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of the FCoV genome. Eighty nine percent of the sampled animals were positive for the presence of FCoV. Among the FCoV positive cats, 80% of cats were males and 64% were below 2 years of age. The FCoV positive cases included 56% domestic short hair (DSH), 40% Persian, and 4% Siamese cats. The nucleotide sequences of 10 selected amplified products from FIP cases were determined. The sequence comparison revealed that the field isolates had 96% homology with a few point mutations. The extent of homology decreased to 93% when compared with reference strains. The overall branching pattern of phylogenetic tree showed two distinct clusters, where all Malaysian isolates fall into one main genetic cluster. These findings provided the first genetic information of FCoV in Malaysia.

Responding to Pandemic Influenza: A Local Perspective

OBJECTIVE: To assess, via a tabletop exercise, the ability of a rural health unit to manage an influenza pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: The exercise brought together community stakeholders including representation from public health, hospitals, long-term care, social services, first responders, morticians, local government and the media. SETTING: Leeds, Grenville and Lanark, a rural region of Ontario. p ]Intervention: In June 2002, exercise participants were presented with a scenario involving the local response to pandemic influenza. Facilitators prepared a framework for the mock emergency in advance. However, the scenario was guided by decisions made by participants and the probable consequences of those decisions. Following the exercise, a debriefing session identified recommendations to be included in future plan development. OUTCOMES: The exercise identified critical issues, including communication, emergency decision-making, vaccination priorization, local surge capacity, and disease containment. Both participants and observers deemed the exercise successful. CONCLUSION: Improvements in the local contingency plan for pandemic influenza were identified. The exercise was an opportunity to familiarize participants with the contingency plan, practice working collectively and identify areas for further planning. The principles and lessons generated from the exercise can be used to guide the response to other large-scale infectious disease outbreaks.

One-Shot Recognition of Manufacturing Defects in Steel Surfaces

Abstract Quality control is an essential process in manufacturing to make the product defect-free as well as to meet customer needs. The automation of this process is important to maintain high quality along with the high manufacturing throughput. With recent developments in deep learning and computer vision technologies, it has become possible to detect various features from the images with near-human accuracy. However, many of these approaches are data intensive. Training and deployment of such a system on manufacturing floors may become expensive and time-consuming. The need for large amounts of training data is one of the limitations of the applicability of these approaches in real-world manufacturing systems. In this work, we propose the application of a Siamese convolutional neural network to do one-shot recognition for such a task. Our results demonstrate how one-shot learning can be used in quality control of steel by identification of defects on the steel surface. This method can significantly reduce the requirements of training data and can also be run in real-time.

COVID-19 and Income Profile: How People in Different Income Groups Responded to Disease Outbreak, Case Study of the United States

Due to immature treatment and rapid transmission of COVID-19, mobility interventions play a crucial role in containing the outbreak. Among various non-pharmacological interventions, community infection control is considered to be a quite promising approach. However, there is a lack of research on improving community-level interventions based on a community's real conditions and characteristics using real-world observations. Our paper aims to investigate the different responses to mobility interventions between communities in the United States with a specific focus on different income levels. We produced six daily mobility metrics for all communities using the mobility location data from over 100 million anonymous devices on a monthly basis. Each metric is tabulated by three performance indicators:"best performance,""effort,"and"consistency."We found that being high-income improves social distancing behavior after controlling multiple confounding variables in each of the eighteen scenarios. In addition to the reality that it is more difficult for low-income communities to comply with social distancing, the comparisons between scenarios raise concerns on the employment status, working condition, accessibility to life supplies, and exposure to the virus of low-income communities.

PANDA: Policy-aware Location Privacy for Epidemic Surveillance

In this demonstration, we present a privacy-preserving epidemic surveillance system. Recently, many countries that suffer from coronavirus crises attempt to access citizen's location data to eliminate the outbreak. However, it raises privacy concerns and may open the doors to more invasive forms of surveillance in the name of public health. It also brings a challenge for privacy protection techniques: how can we leverage people's mobile data to help combat the pandemic without scarifying our location privacy. We demonstrate that we can have the best of the two worlds by implementing policy-based location privacy for epidemic surveillance. Specifically, we formalize the privacy policy using graphs in light of differential privacy, called policy graph. Our system has three primary functions for epidemic surveillance: location monitoring, epidemic analysis, and contact tracing. We provide an interactive tool allowing the attendees to explore and examine the usability of our system: (1) the utility of location monitor and disease transmission model estimation, (2) the procedure of contact tracing in our systems, and (3) the privacy-utility trade-offs w.r.t. different policy graphs. The attendees can find that it is possible to have the full functionality of epidemic surveillance while preserving location privacy.

Use of a Fibrinogen/Thrombin-Based Collagen Fleece (TachoComb, TachoSil) With a Stapled Closure to Prevent Pancreatic Fistula Formation Following Distal Pancreatectomy.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE Postoperative pancreatic fistula formation remains a source of significant morbidity following distal pancreatectomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of clinically significant fistulas (International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula grade B and grade C) after distal pancreatectomy using a fibrinogen/thrombin-based collagen fleece (TachoComb, TachoSil) with a stapled closure. METHODS Seventy-five patients underwent distal pancreatectomy at our institution between January 2005 and March 2014. A fibrinogen/thrombin-based collagen fleece was applied to the staple line of the pancreas before stapling. RESULTS Twenty-six patients (34.7%) developed a pancreatic fistula, 8 patients (10.7%) developed a grade B fistula, and no patients developed a grade C fistula. The duration of the drain was significantly different in patients with or without a pancreatic fistula (8.0 ± 4.5 vs. 5.4 ± 1.3 days, P = .0003). Histological analysis showed that there was a tight covering with the fibrinogen/thrombin-based collagen fleece. CONCLUSION The fibrinogen/thrombin-based collagen fleece (TachoComb, TachoSil) with a stapled closure has low rates of fistula formation and provides a safe alternative to the conventional stapled technique in distal pancreatectomy.

The Swedish breeding cat: population description, infectious diseases and reproductive performance evaluated by a questionnaire

The questionnaire based study gives a combined description of management, infectious diseases and reproductive performance in breeding catteries during 1 year. The mean number of cats per cattery was 6.1, and 25% of the breeders let some of their cats have free access to outdoors. Breeders reported that infection with feline panleukopenia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus or feline leukaemia virus was uncommon, but 8% of the breeders had sold or had themselves owned a cat that died of feline infectious peritonitis. Presence of conjunctivitis was reported by 33.3% of the breeders. Mean litter size was 3.7±1.5, with 9.7% stillbirths and 8.3% kitten mortality week 1–12. The percentage of stillborn kittens increased with the age of the queen and litter size, and also differed among breeds. Kitten mortality differed among breeds, but did not increase with age of the queen. Seven percent of the litters were delivered by caesarean section, significantly more during winter and positively associated with presence of stillborn kittens.

Bridging the Gap Between AI and Healthcare Sides: Towards Developing Clinically Relevant AI-Powered Diagnosis Systems

Despite the success of Convolutional Neural Network-based Computer-Aided Diagnosis research, its clinical applications remain challenging. Accordingly, developing medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) fitting into a clinical environment requires identifying/bridging the gap between AI and Healthcare sides. Since the biggest problem in Medical Imaging lies in data paucity, confirming the clinical relevance for diagnosis of research-proven image augmentation techniques is essential. Therefore, we hold a clinically valuable AI-envisioning workshop among Japanese Medical Imaging experts, physicians, and generalists in Healthcare/Informatics. Then, a questionnaire survey for physicians evaluates our pathology-aware Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based image augmentation projects in terms of Data Augmentation and physician training. The workshop reveals the intrinsic gap between AI/Healthcare sides and solutions on Why (i.e., clinical significance/interpretation) and How (i.e., data acquisition, commercial deployment, and safety/feeling safe). This analysis confirms our pathology-aware GANs’ clinical relevance as a clinical decision support system and non-expert physician training tool. Our findings would play a key role in connecting inter-disciplinary research and clinical applications, not limited to the Japanese medical context and pathology-aware GANs.

Chapter 3 Ethnomedicinal Wisdom An Approach for Antiviral Drug Development

Abstract Nature has its own way of protecting mankind from the atrocities of illness and diseases by producing natural products of diverse structures and bioactivities, not only necessary for good health but also to combat diverse life-style and infectious diseases including microbial infections caused by virus, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and other parasites. The problems of emerging and emerging diseases with drug resistance, latency, and reactivation along with the shorter life span of most synthetic agents or drugs have directed scientists to look into the treasure chests of nature to find out and explore the natural metabolites of plants for the management of diverse diseases including viral diseases. This chapter explains the treasure of “Ethnomedicine” and its journey through time, which reveals the importance of this branch of “natural science” in the current scenario, its potential as “alternative or complementary” medicine, especially against viral diseases with a detailed account of identified antivirals, their isolation and identification as “natural antiviral” to make the readers realize the need to accept “ethnomedicine” as appropriate alternatives to “synthetic chemistry.”

Molecular gymnastics at the herpesvirus surface

This review analyses recent structural results that provide clues about a possible molecular mechanism for the transmission of a fusogenic signal among the envelope glycoproteins of the herpes simplex virus on receptor binding by glycoprotein gD. This signal triggers the membrane-fusion machinery of the virus—contained in glycoproteins gB, gH and gL—to induce the merging of viral and cellular membranes, and to allow virus entry into target cells. This activating process parallels that of γ-retroviruses, in which receptor binding by the amino-terminal domain of the envelope protein activates the fusogenic potential of the virion in a similar way, despite the different organization of the envelope complexes of these two types of viruses. Therefore, the new structural results on the interaction of gD with its receptors might also provide insights into the mechanism of fusogenic signal transmission in γ-retroviruses. Furthermore, the fusion activation parallels with retroviruses, together with the recently reported structural homology of gB with the rhabdovirus envelope glycoprotein indicate that the complex entry apparatus of herpesviruses appears to be functionally related to that of simpler enveloped viruses.

Cardiac injuries in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: Not to be ignored

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We recruited 73 patients with COVID-19 [49 men and 24 women; average age: 58.36 years (SD: 14.31)] admitted to the intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from December 30, 2019 to February 16, 2020. Demographics, underlying diseases, and laboratory test results on admission were collected and analyzed. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. RESULTS: The non-survivors were older (65.46 [SD 9.74]vs 46.23 [12.01]) and were more likely to have chronic medical illnesses. Non-survivors tend to develop more severe lymphopenia, with higher C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, D-dimer, and hs-Troponin I(hs-TnI) levels. Patients with elevated hs-TnI levels on admission had shorter duration from symptom onset to death. Increased hs-TnI level was related to dismal prognosis. Death risk increased by 20.8% when the hs-TnI level increased by one unit. After adjusting for inflammatory or coagulation index, the independent predictive relationship between hs-TnI and death disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac injury may occur at the early stage of COVID-19, which is associated with high mortality. Inflammatory factor cascade and coagulation abnormality may be the potential mechanisms of COVID-19 combined with cardiac injury.

Quality of primary health care in China: challenges and recommendations

China has substantially increased financial investment and introduced favourable policies for strengthening its primary health care system with core responsibilities in preventing and managing chronic diseases such as hypertension and emerging infectious diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, widespread gaps in the quality of primary health care still exist. In this Review, we aim to identify the causes for this poor quality, and provide policy recommendations. System challenges include: the suboptimal education and training of primary health-care practitioners, a fee-for-service payment system that incentivises testing and treatments over prevention, fragmentation of clinical care and public health service, and insufficient continuity of care throughout the entire health-care system. The following recommendations merit consideration: (1) enhancement of the quality of training for primary health-care physicians, (2) establishment of performance accountability to incentivise high-quality and high-value care; (3) integration of clinical care with the basic public health services, and (4) strengthening of the coordination between primary health-care institutions and hospitals. Additionally, China should consider modernising its primary health-care system through the establishment of a learning health system built on digital data and innovative technologies.

The State of Health System(s) in Africa: Challenges and Opportunities

As study after study has pointed out, the health care systems in Africa pay little attention to the critical interface between education and good health, especially when it comes to the education of women and mothers, who are the primary line of defense against child diseases, and perform simultaneously most domestic chores and critical agricultural activities. While many medical educational institutions on the continent tend to perpetuate, at times, skewed and irrelevant Eurocentric health training, the national pyramidal health structure, weakened at the village level, and disproportionately favoring the provincial and national hospitals, gives the illusion that rural areas are well-served, when in actuality they are not. This chapter endorses the restrengthening of an uncompromised health care system to make it effective and efficient for both rural and urban areas; one that finds ways of trimming financial and human resource waste; revamps the institutions that train health care and service providers to make the system responsive to the real health needs of the people and not just the wealthy; one that compensates physicians just as civil servants; and aligns the educational system with targeted and expected measurable health outcomes.

Specific increase of Fusobacterium in the faecal microbiota of neonatal calves infected with Cryptosporidium parvum

The faecal microbiota plays a critical role in host health, with alterations in the human faecal microbial composition associated with various conditions, particularly diarrhoeal diseases. However, little is known about microbial changes during cryptosporidiosis, one of the most important diarrhoeal diseases caused by protozoa in cattle. In this study, alterations in the faecal microbiota of neonatal calves as a result of Cryptosporidium parvum infection were investigated on a C. parvum-positive farm. Comparisons were made among groups of C. parvum-infected, rotavirus-infected, and the pathogen-negative calves. A specific increase in the abundance of Fusobacterium was observed in the faecal microbiota of C. parvum-infected animals. Diarrhoea severity increased in accordance with the abundance of C. parvum and Fusobacterium. Moreover, the specific increase of Fusobacterium appeared to be a universal feature of C. parvum infection, since neonatal calves from geographically separated areas showed the same result. These observations indicated that the growth of Fusobacterium may be an important aggravating factor of cryptosporidiosis.

Grand Challenges in Migration Biology

Billions of animals migrate each year. To successfully reach their destination, migrants must have evolved an appropriate genetic program and suitable developmental, morphological, physiological, biomechanical, behavioral, and life-history traits. Moreover, they must interact successfully with biotic and abiotic factors in their environment. Migration therefore provides an excellent model system in which to address several of the “grand challenges” in organismal biology. Previous research on migration, however, has often focused on a single aspect of the phenomenon, largely due to methodological, geographical, or financial constraints. Integrative migration biology asks ‘big questions’ such as how, when, where, and why animals migrate, which can be answered by examining the process from multiple ecological and evolutionary perspectives, incorporating multifaceted knowledge from various other scientific disciplines, and using new technologies and modeling approaches, all within the context of an annual cycle. Adopting an integrative research strategy will provide a better understanding of the interactions between biological levels of organization, of what role migrants play in disease transmission, and of how to conserve migrants and the habitats upon which they depend.

Smart Fire Alarm System with Person Detection and Thermal Camera

Fire alarm is crucial for safety of life and property in many scenes. A good fire alarm system should be small-sized, low-cost and effective to prevent fire accidents from happening. In this paper we introduce a smart fire alarm system used in kitchen as a representative scenario. The system captures both thermal and optical videos for temperature monitoring and person detection, which are further used to predict potential fire accident and avoid false alarm. Thermal videos are used to record the temperature change in region-of-interests, for example, cookware. YOLOv3-tiny algorithm is modified for person detection and can be iteratively improved with the hard examples gathered by the system. To implement the system on an edge device instead of a server, we propose a high-efficiency neural network inference computing framework called TuringNN. Comprehensive rules enable the system to appropriately respond to different situations. The proposed system has been proved effective in both experiments and numerous cases in complex practical applications.

Detection of novel coronaviruses in bats in Myanmar

The recent emergence of bat-borne zoonotic viruses warrants vigilant surveillance in their natural hosts. Of particular concern is the family of coronaviruses, which includes the causative agents of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and most recently, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), an epidemic of acute respiratory illness originating from Wuhan, China in December 2019. Viral detection, discovery, and surveillance activities were undertaken in Myanmar to identify viruses in animals at high risk contact interfaces with people. Free-ranging bats were captured, and rectal and oral swabs and guano samples collected for coronaviral screening using broadly reactive consensus conventional polymerase chain reaction. Sequences from positives were compared to known coronaviruses. Three novel alphacoronaviruses, three novel betacoronaviruses, and one known alphacoronavirus previously identified in other southeast Asian countries were detected for the first time in bats in Myanmar. Ongoing land use change remains a prominent driver of zoonotic disease emergence in Myanmar, bringing humans into ever closer contact with wildlife, and justifying continued surveillance and vigilance at broad scales.

Molecular conservation and differential mutation on ORF3a gene in Indian SARS-CoV2 genomes

Abstract A global emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic demands various studies related to genes and genomes of the SARS-CoV2. Among other important proteins, the role of accessory proteins are of immense importance in replication, regulation of infections of the coronavirus in the hosts. The largest accessory protein in the SARS-CoV2 genome is ORF3a which modulates the host response to the virus infection and consequently it plays an important role in pathogenesis. In this study, an attempt is made to decipher the conservation of nucleotides, dimers, codons and amino acids in the ORF3a genes across thirty-two genomes of Indian patients. ORF3a gene possesses single and double point mutations in Indian SARS-CoV2 genomes suggesting the change of SARS-CoV2's virulence property in Indian patients. We find that the parental origin of the ORF3a gene over the genomes of SARS-CoV2 and Pangolin-CoV is same from the phylogenetic analysis based on conservation of nucleotides and so on. This study highlights the accumulation of mutation on ORF3a in Indian SARS-CoV2 genomes which may provide the designing therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV2.

Management of infections in critically ill returning travellers in the intensive care unit—I: considerations on infection control and transmission of resistance

Summary Depending on their destinations and activities, international travellers are at a significant risk of contracting both communicable and non-communicable diseases. On return to their home countries, such travellers may require intensive care. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and more recently Ebola haemorrhagic fever, has highlighted the risks. Other well-known communicable pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been described previously. However, malaria remains by far the most important cause of death. The issues related to imported antibiotic resistance and protection from highly contagious diseases are reviewed here. Surveillance strategies based on epidemiological data (country visited, duration of travel, and time elapsed since return) and clinical syndromes, together with systematic search policies, are usually mandatory to limit the risk of an outbreak. Single-bed hospital rooms and isolation according to symptoms should be the rule while awaiting laboratory test results. Because person-to-person contact is the main route of transmission, healthcare workers should implement specific prevention strategies.

Flavivirus induces MHC antigen on human myoblasts: A model of autoimmune myositis?

Infection of human embryonic myoblasts by West Nile virus (WNV), a flavivirus, caused significant upregulation of class I and II MHC expression as determined by flow cytometry. After 48 hours at a multiplicity of infection of 5 pfu/cell, a sixfold increase in MHC class I expression was induced from initially low levels of expression. In contrast, MHC class II was induced de novo to five times the control fluorescence level. At least 70% of the cells were infected as determined using fluorescence microscopy and anti‐WNV antibody labeling. Myoblasts were > 90% pure as shown by anti–Leu‐19 labeling. MHC class I (but not class II) was increased threefold after exposure to virus‐inactivated supernatant from 48‐hour–infected cells, indicating the presence of factor(s) contributing to the MHC class I increase. These findings may be important in establishing a link between viral infection of human cells and induction of inflammatory autoimmune disease. We discuss the possibility of using WNV as an in vivo model. © 1992 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Ocular mucins: Purification, metabolism and functions

Mucins are present at the ocular surface in both secreted and membrane-bound forms. Mucins are produced in partby the conjunctial goblet cells, and are complemented by non-globet secretions. This review focuses on secreted ocular mucins. They are present in the tear film, probably both in gel and soluble form, and play a role in lubrication and ocular defense. It is apparent that mucins are highly adapted to their functions. State of the art techniques for mucin purification and analysis are presented. Density gradient centrifugation, gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography and agarose gel electrophoresis are discussed, together with methods of oliogosaccharide analysis. Reagents for the detection of mucin are considered in conjunction with these methods, which we have employed in the analysis of human and canine ocular mucins. The general structure of mucins is reviewed. The biosyntheas and glycosylation of ocular mucins are not yet fully understood, and are discussed in relation to currently established concepts. The impaact of disease on the nature and secretion of mucins is considered, as well as the physiological and pathological significance of mucus degradation.

SARS-CoV related Betacoronavirus and diverse Alphacoronavirus members found in western old-world

Abstract The emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, triggered the discovery of a high diversity of coronaviruses in bats. Studies from Europe have shown that coronaviruses circulate in bats in France but this reflects only a fraction of the whole diversity. In the current study the diversity of coronaviruses circulating in western Europe was extensively explored. Ten alphacoronaviruses in eleven bat species belonging to the Miniopteridae, Vespertilionidae and Rhinolophidae families and, a SARS-CoV-related Betacoronavirus in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum were identified. The diversity and prevalence of bat coronaviruses presently reported from western Europe is much higher than previously described and includes a SARS-CoV sister group. This diversity demonstrates the dynamic evolution and circulation of coronaviruses in this species. That said, the identified coronaviruses were consistently associated with a particular bat species or genus, and these relationships were maintained no matter the geographic location. The observed phylogenetic grouping of coronaviruses from the same species in Europe and Asia, emphasizes the role of host/pathogen coevolution in this group.

Short-term predictions of country-specific Covid-19 infection rates based on power law scaling exponents

The number of corona virus (COVID-19) infections grows worldwide. In order to create short term predictions to prepare for the extent of the global pandemic we analyze infection data from the top 25 affected countries. It is shown that all country-specific infection rates follow a power law growth behavior and the scaling exponents per country are calculated. We find two different growth patterns: either steady power law growth from the very beginning with moderate scaling exponents of 3-5 or explosive power law growth with dramatic scaling exponents of 8-11. In the case of the USA we even find an exponent of 16.59. By means of data analysis we confirm that instituting strict measures of lock-downs combined with a strong adherence by the population are effective means to bring the growth rates down. While many countries have instituted measures there are only three countries (Denmark, Norway, and South Korea) so far where such lock-downs led to a significant reduction of the growth rate. In the case of Denmark we calculate the reduction of the scaling exponents to move from 6.82 to 1.47.

Abstract Cores in Implicit Hitting Set MaxSat Solving

Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSat) solving is an active area of research motivated by numerous successful applications to solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. One of the most successful approaches to solving MaxSat instances arising from real world applications is the Implicit Hitting Set (IHS) approach. IHS solvers are complete MaxSat solvers that harness the strengths of both Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) and Integer Linear Programming (IP) solvers by decoupling core-extraction and optimization. While such solvers show state-of-the-art performance on many instances, it is known that there exist MaxSat instances on which IHS solvers need to extract an exponential number of cores before terminating. Motivated by the structure of the simplest of these problematic instances, we propose a technique we call abstract cores that provides a compact representation for a potentially exponential number of regular cores. We demonstrate how to incorporate abstract core reasoning into the IHS algorithm and report on an empirical evaluation demonstrating that including abstract cores into a state-of-the-art IHS solver improves its performance enough to surpass the best performing solvers of the most recent 2019 MaxSat Evaluation.

Laparoscopic Radiofrequency Ablation for Large Subcapsular Hepatic Hemangiomas: Technical and Clinical Outcomes.

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the technical and clinical outcomes of using laparoscopic radiofrequency (RF) ablation for treating large subcapsular hepatic hemangiomas. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our sequential experience of treating 124 large subcapsular hepatic hemangiomas in 121 patients with laparoscopic RF ablation. RESULTS The mean diameter of the 124 hemangiomas was 9.1 ± 3.2 cm (5.0-16.0 cm). RF ablation was performed successfully in all patients. There were 55 complications related to the ablation in 26 patients, including 5 of 69 (7.3%) patients with hemangioma <10 cm and 21 of 52 (40.4%) patients with hemangiomas ≥10 cm (P < 0.001). No injuries to abdominal viscera occurred in all the 121 patients. According to the Dindo-Clavien classification, all the complications were minor in 26 patients (Grade I). Out of 124 hepatic hemangiomas, 118 (95.2%) were completely ablated, including 70 of 72 (97.2%) lesions < 10 cm and 48 of 52 (92.3%) lesions ≥ 10 cm (P = 0.236). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic RF ablation therapy is a safe, feasible and effective procedure for large subcapsular hepatic hemangiomas, even in the hepatic hemangiomas ≥ 10 cm. Its use avoids thermal injury to the abdominal viscera.

COVID‐19Clinical trials: quality matters more than quantity

Despite the ferment aroused in the scientific community by the COVID‐19 outbreak and the over 11,000 papers listed in PubMed, published evidence on safe and effective drugs has not progressed yet at the same speed of the pandemic. However, clinical research is rapidly progressing, as shown by the hundreds of registered clinical trials on candidate drugs for COVID‐19. Unfortunately, information on protocols of individual studies differs from registry to registry. Furthermore, study designs, criteria for stratification of patients and choice of outcomes are quite heterogeneous. All this makes data sharing and secondary analysis difficult.At last, small single centre studies and the use of drugs on a compassionate basis should be replaced by highly powered, multi‐centre, multi‐arm clinical trials, in orderto provide the required evidence of safety and efficacy of novel or repurposed candidate drugs. Hopefully, the efforts of clinical researchers in the fight against the SARS Cov‐2 will result into the identification of effective treatments. To make this possible, clinical research should be oriented by guidelines for more harmonized high‐quality studies and by a united commitment of the scientific community to share personal knowledge and data. Allergists and clinical immunologists should have a leading role in this unprecedent challenge.

Predicting virus emergence amid evolutionary noise

The study of virus disease emergence, whether it can be predicted and how it might be prevented, has become a major research topic in biomedicine. Here we show that efforts to predict disease emergence commonly conflate fundamentally different evolutionary and epidemiological time scales, and are likely to fail because of the enormous number of unsampled viruses that could conceivably emerge in humans. Although we know much about the patterns and processes of virus evolution on evolutionary time scales as depicted in family-scale phylogenetic trees, these data have little predictive power to reveal the short-term microevolutionary processes that underpin cross-species transmission and emergence. Truly understanding disease emergence therefore requires a new mechanistic and integrated view of the factors that allow or prevent viruses spreading in novel hosts. We present such a view, suggesting that both ecological and genetic aspects of virus emergence can be placed within a simple population genetic framework, which in turn highlights the importance of host population size and density in determining whether emergence will be successful. Despite this framework, we conclude that a more practical solution to preventing and containing the successful emergence of new diseases entails ongoing virological surveillance at the human–animal interface and regions of ecological disturbance.

Type III IFN Receptor Expression and Functional Characterisation in the Pteropid Bat, Pteropus alecto

Bats are rich reservoir hosts for a variety of viruses, many of which are capable of spillover to other susceptible mammals with lethal consequences. The ability of bats to remain asymptomatic to viral infection may be due to the rapid control of viral replication very early in the immune response through innate antiviral mechanisms. Type I and III interferons (IFNs) represent the first line of defence against viral infection in mammals, with both families of IFNs present in pteropid bats. To obtain further insight into the type III IFN system in bats, we describe the characterization of the type III IFN receptor (IFNλR) in the black flying fox, P. alecto with the characterization of IFNλR1 and IL10R2 genes that make up the type III IFN receptor complex. The bat IFNλR complex has a wide tissue distribution and at the cellular level, both epithelial and immune cells are responsive to IFN-λ treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the bat IFNλR1 chain acts as a functional receptor. To our knowledge, this report represents the first description of an IFN receptor in any species of bat. The responsiveness of bat cells to IFN-λ support a role for the type III IFN system by epithelial and immune cells in bats.

Protective effect of OK‐432 (streptococcal preparation) on murine fulminant hepatitis following mouse hepatitis virus infection

The effects of OK‐432 (streptococcal preparation) on murine fulminant hepatitis were investigated. Hepatitis was induced by injection of mouse hepatitis virus type 2 (MHV‐2) at a strength of either 1 times 10(3) or 1 times 10(4) plaque‐forming units (PFU). Mice without OK‐432 treatment died within 5 days, whereas mice pre‐inoculated with OK‐432 showed survival rates of 50% (1 times 10(3)PFU) or 10% (1 times 10(4)PFU) after 60 days. Survival time was not prolonged if OK‐432 was injected after MHV‐2. Examined histologically, mice not treated with OK‐432 showed severe haemorrhagic necrosis of the liver, often panlobular. Treated mice showed less necrosis; the least necrosis was observed in those injected with OK‐432 before MHV‐2. In those mice injected first with OK‐432 and then with 1 times 10(3)PFU of MHV‐2 that survived 7 days, autopsy showed a very slight and focal hepatic necrosis, with follicular infiltration by lymphocytes and macrophages. Mitogenic reaction of spleen cells was remarkably less than normal in mice with MHV‐2 injection. However, mice injected with OK‐432 before MHV‐2 (same treatment as mice showing high survival rates) showed relatively high reactivity in comparison with mice not treated with OK‐432.

Sequence–function analysis of the Sendai virus L protein domain VI

Abstract The large (about 2200 amino acids) L polymerase protein of nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses (order Mononegavirales) has six conserved sequence regions (“domains”) postulated to constitute the specific enzymatic activities involved in viral mRNA synthesis, 5′-end capping, cap methylation, 3′ polyadenylation, and genomic RNA replication. Previous studies with vesicular stomatitis virus identified amino acid residues within the L protein domain VI required for mRNA cap methylation. In our recent study we analyzed four amino acid residues within domain VI of the Sendai virus L protein and our data indicated that there could be differences in L protein sequence requirements for cap methylation in two different families of Mononegavirales — rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses. In this study, we conducted a more comprehensive mutational analysis by targeting the entire SeV L protein domain VI, creating twenty-four L mutants, and testing these mutations for their effects on viral mRNA synthesis, cap methylation, viral genome replication and virus growth kinetics. Our analysis identified several residues required for successful cap methylation and virus replication and clearly showed the importance of the K-D-K-E tetrad and glycine-rich motif in the SeV cap methylation. This study is the first extensive sequence analysis of the L protein domain VI in the family Paramyxoviridae, and it confirms structural and functional similarity of this domain across different families of the order Mononegavirales.

A placebo-controlled crossover study of iloperidone augmentation for residual anger and irritability in major depressive disorder.

BACKGROUND Even when patients experience remission with antidepressants, many continue to report anger attacks and excessive irritability despite continued treatment. Iloperidone antagonizes 5-HT-2a, D2, and alpha-1 receptors, which can have anti-aggressive effects. We examined iloperidone's safety and efficacy as an augmentation agent in outpatients with partially remitted major depressive disorder (MDD) with residual symptoms of anger and irritability. METHODS A total of 13 outpatients with partially remitted MDD [currently treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)] received four weeks of iloperidone or placebo, followed by one week of washout. Patients were then crossed over to the other treatment arm for 4 weeks. Treatment arms were randomized and double blind; and two sites were used for the study. Analyses compared treatment response using the Symptom Questionnaire (SQ) Anger/Hostility Subscale as the primary outcome measure. RESULTS There was no significant differential effect of iloperidone × weeks on the SQ Anger/Hostility Subscore over the course of the study, compared with placebo × weeks, regardless of administration order (p = 0.77). CONCLUSIONS Iloperidone did not significantly outperform placebo on measures of anger or irritability in patients with partially remitted MDD and residual anger/irritability.

Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Remdesivir, an Antiviral for Treatment of COVID-19, in Healthy Subjects

Remdesivir (RDV), a single diastereomeric monophosphoroamidate prodrug that inhibits viral RNA polymerases, has potent in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV2. RDV received FDA's emergency use authorization in United States and approval in Japan for treatment of severe COVID-19 patients. This report describes two phase 1 studies that evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single escalating and multiple intravenous (IV) doses of RDV (solution or lyophilized formulation) in healthy subjects. Lyophilized formulation was evaluated for potential future use in clinical trials due to its storage stability in resource-limited settings. All adverse events were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Overall, RDV exhibited a linear profile following single-dose IV administration over 2 hours of RDV solution formulation across the dose range of 3 to 225mg. Both lyophilized and solution formulations provided comparable PK parameters. High intracellular concentrations of the active triphosphate (approximately 220 to 370- fold higher than the in vitro EC50 against SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate) were achieved following infusion of 75 mg or 150 mg lyophilized formulation over 30 minutes or 2 hours. Following multiple-doses of RDV 150mg once daily for 7 or 14 days, RDV exhibited a PK profile similar to single-dose administration. Metabolite GS-441524 accumulated approximately 1.9-fold after daily dosing. Overall, RDV exhibited favorable safety and PK profiles that supported once-daily dosing.

Quadruple therapy for asymptomatic COVID-19 infection patients

Introduction: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is currently in epidemic stage. After large-scale interpersonal infection, asymptomatic patients appear. Whether asymptomatic patients are contagious or not and whether they need medication are the arguments among clinical experts. Areas covered: This paper reports a special asymptomatic couple with COVID-19, of which the male patient is an intercity bus driver but has not induced confirmed infection of his 188 passengers. The patients were treated with four combinations of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets, arbidol tablets, Lianhuaqingwen granules, and recombinant human interferon-α2b (IFN-α2b) injection via aerosol. Their clinical characteristics and medication were summarized and analyzed. Expert opinion: The two asymptomatic patients far away from Wuhan did not seem to be highly contagious. They improved obviously, after treatment with the quadruple therapy, but the effective drug is still unknown. It should be noted that lopinavir/ritonavir tablets have many drug interactions and are the most likely drugs to cause hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in these two patients. IFN-α2b is more effective in the early stage of virus infection. Arbidol instruction dose may not be sufficient to inhibit the novel coronavirus in vivo. The evidence-based medicine of Lianhuaqingwen granules for treating various viral infections is just based on Chinese patients.

A multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction panel for detecting neurologic pathogens in dogs with meningoencephalitis

Meningoencephalitis (ME) is a common inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system in dogs. Clinically, ME has both infectious and non-infectious causes. In the present study, a multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (mqPCR) panel was optimized for the detection of eight canine neurologic pathogens (Blastomyces dermatitidis, Cryptococcus spp., Neospora caninum, Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Ehrlichia canis, and canine distemper virus [CDV]). The mqPCR panel was subsequently applied to 53 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected from dogs with ME. The analytic sensitivity (i.e., limit of detection, expressed as molecules per 1 µL of recombinant vector) was 3.8 for CDV, 3.7 for Ehrlichia canis, 3.7 for Bartonella spp., 3.8 for Borrelia burgdorferi, 3.7 for Blastomyces dermatitidis, 3.7 for Cryptococcus spp., 38 for Neospora caninum, and 3.7 for Toxoplasma gondii. Among the tested CSF samples, seven (15%) were positive for the following pathogens in decreasing order of frequency: Cryptococcus spp. (3/7), Blastomyces dermatitidis (2/7), and Borrelia burgdorferi (2/7). In summary, use of an mqPCR panel with high analytic sensitivity as an initial screen for infectious agents in dogs with ME could facilitate the selection of early treatment strategies and improve outcomes.

Managing psychological distress in children and adolescents following the COVID-19 epidemic: A cooperative approach.

Children and adolescents are susceptible to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic and tend to show posttraumatic distress. Immediately after an epidemic, governments and social organizations often provide psychological services for children and adolescents to relieve their distress. However, many adolescents report distress even long after a traumatic event because of the unaddressed traumatic atmosphere in schools or families. To advance this issue, this article proposes a cooperative model of psychological services provision for children and adolescents in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. This model suggests that psychological services should simultaneously include social, school, and family systems, which interact and have a synergistic effect. The social system provides direct services not only for children and adolescents but also for their school and family systems; school and family systems cooperate to support adolescents. Psychological work also needs to emphasize the key elements of school and family systems. Attention should be given to teachers' distress, teacher-student relationships, and peer relationships in the school system, as well as to parents' distress, parent-child relationships, and the marital relationship in the family system. In these ways, adolescents can achieve an efficient and sustainable recovery following a disaster. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

On the Complexity of Stackelberg Matroid Pricing Problems

In a Stackelberg pricing problem a distinguished player, the leader, chooses prices for a set of items, and one or several other players, the followers, seeks to buy a feasible subset of the items with minimal costs. The leader’s goal is to maximize her revenue, which is determined by the sold items and their prices. We are interested in cases where the followers’ feasible subsets are given by a combinatorial optimization problem. For example, a pricing problem based on the shortest path problem was used by Labbé et al. [15] to model road-toll setting scenarios. In this paper, we consider Stackelberg pricing problems that are based on matroids. The followers seek to buy a subset that is a basis. More specifically, we consider uniform, partition and laminar matroids. We study the complexity of computing leader-optimal prices for a single and multiple followers. We show that optimal prices can be computed in polynomial time for all three matroids if there is one follower. In general, such pricing problems based on matroids are APX-hard (see [11]). For multiple followers, we show that computing optimal prices for uniform matroids can be done in polynomial time. However, for partition and laminar matroids the pricing problem becomes NP-hard .

COVID-19 in people with multiple sclerosis: A global data sharing initiative

BACKGROUND: We need high-quality data to assess the determinants for COVID-19 severity in people with MS (PwMS). Several studies have recently emerged but there is great benefit in aligning data collection efforts at a global scale. OBJECTIVES: Our mission is to scale-up COVID-19 data collection efforts and provide the MS community with data-driven insights as soon as possible. METHODS: Numerous stakeholders were brought together. Small dedicated interdisciplinary task forces were created to speed-up the formulation of the study design and work plan. First step was to agree upon a COVID-19 MS core data set. Second, we worked on providing a user-friendly and rapid pipeline to share COVID-19 data at a global scale. RESULTS: The COVID-19 MS core data set was agreed within 48 hours. To date, 23 data collection partners are involved and the first data imports have been performed successfully. Data processing and analysis is an on-going process. CONCLUSIONS: We reached a consensus on a core data set and established data sharing processes with multiple partners to address an urgent need for information to guide clinical practice. First results show that partners are motivated to share data to attain the ultimate joint goal: better understand the effect of COVID-19 in PwMS.

Radiofrequency ablation of hepatic tumours: effect of post-ablation margin on local tumour progression.

PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the relationship between post-ablation margins and local tumour progression following radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinomas and colorectal liver metastases. METHODS Eighty-three patients with 107 hepatic tumours who underwent RFA were divided into two groups: the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) group (55 patients with 69 lesions) and the colorectal liver metastases group (28 patients with 38 lesions). Post-ablation margins were calculated on 1-month follow-up contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Efficacy was evaluated at 1-month post-ablation, then at 3-month intervals for the first year and biannually thereafter. RESULTS The results of the log-rank test showed that the minimum threshold post-ablation margin of 0.4 cm (P = 0.020) and tumour size smaller than 2.5 cm (P = 0.001) significantly correlated with local control for the HCC group. In the colorectal liver metastases group, the results of the log-rank test showed that the minimum threshold post-ablation margin of 0.4 cm (P = 0.345) and tumour size smaller than 2.5 cm (P = 0.168) did not correlate with local control. CONCLUSION Percutaneous RFA is more effective in achieving local control in patients with HCCs than with colorectal liver metastases.

Mutagenesis of the murine hepatitis virus nsp1-coding region identifies residues important for protein processing, viral RNA synthesis, and viral replication

Abstract Despite ongoing research investigating mechanisms of coronavirus replication, functions of many viral nonstructural proteins (nsps) remain unknown. In the current study, a reverse genetic approach was used to define the role of the 28-kDa amino-terminal product (nsp1) of the gene 1 polyprotein during replication of the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV) in cell culture. To determine whether nsp1 is required for MHV replication and to identify residues critical for protein function, mutant viruses that contained deletions or point mutations within the nsp1-coding region were generated and assayed for defects in viral replication, viral protein expression, protein localization, and RNA synthesis. The results demonstrated that the carboxy-terminal half of nsp1 (residues K124 through L241) was dispensable for virus replication in culture but was required for efficient proteolytic cleavage of nsp1 from the gene 1 polyprotein and for optimal viral replication. Furthermore, whereas deletion of nsp1 residues amino-terminal to K124 failed to produce infectious virus, point mutagenesis of the nsp1 amino-terminus allowed recovery of several mutants with altered replication and RNA synthesis. This study identifies nsp1 residues important for protein processing, viral RNA synthesis, and viral replication.

Targeting and Enrichment of Viral Pathogen by Cell Membrane Cloaked Magnetic Nanoparticles for Enhanced Detection.

Attachment to cellular surfaces is a major attribute among infectious pathogens for initiating disease pathogenesis. In viral infections, viruses exploit receptor-ligand interactions to latch onto cellular exterior prior to subsequent entry and invasion. In light of the selective binding affinity between viral pathogens and cells, nanoparticles cloaked in cellular membranes are herein employed for virus targeting. Using the influenza virus as a model, erythrocyte membrane cloaked nanoparticles are prepared and modified with magnetic functionalities (RBC-mNP) for virus targeting and isolation. To maximize targeting and isolation efficiency, density gradient centrifugation and nanoparticle tracking analysis were applied to minimize the presence of uncoated particles and membrane vesicles. The resulting nanoparticles possess a distinctive membrane corona, a sialylated surface, and form colloidally stable clusters with influenza viruses. Magnetic functionality is bestowed to the nanoparticles through encapsulation of superparamagnetic iron-oxide particles, which enable influenza virus enrichment via magnetic extraction. Viral samples enriched by the RBC-mNPs result in significantly enhanced virus detection by multiple virus quantification methods, including qRT-PCR, immunnochromatographic strip test, and cell-based titering assays. The demonstration of pathogen targeting and isolation by RBC-mNPs highlights a biologically inspired approach toward improved treatment and diagnosis against infectious disease threats. The work also sheds light on the efficient membrane cloaking mechanism that bestows nanoparticles with cell mimicking functionalities.

Detection of three human adenovirus species in adults with acute respiratory infection in China

Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are recognized as causal agents in a wide range of human diseases. However, researchers lack sufficient data on the exact HAdV species and serotypes associated with adult acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs). To detect and characterize HAdV infections in adults in China, clinical specimens were collected from 10,310 adults with ARTIs from May 2005 to July 2010. The partial HAdV hexon gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequenced, and phylogenetically analyzed. HAdVs were detected in 86 samples (0.8%), of which 67 (77.9%) were species B (HAdV-3, -7, -11, and -14), 7 (8.1%) were species C (HAdV-1, -2, and -6), and 12 (14%) were species E (HAdV-4). HAdV-3 was the most frequently detected serotype (41/86, 47.7%), followed by HAdV-7 (13/86, 15.1%), HAdV-4 (12/86, 14.0%), and HAdV-11 (11/86, 12.8%). Patients 14–25 years old (60.5%) exhibited a higher rate of adenovirus detection than older patients. Co-infections with other respiratory viruses were observed in samples positive for HAdV species B and E. Human rhinovirus was the most commonly found virus in patients with HAdV infection. These findings provide baseline data for the surveillance and control of HAdV infection in China.

Pure laparoscopic living donor hepatectomy: Focus on 55 donors undergoing right hepatectomy.

Although laparoscopic donor hepatectomy is increasingly common, few centers with substantial experience have reported the results of pure laparoscopic donor right hepatectomy (PLDRH). Here, we report the experiences of 60 consecutive liver donors undergoing pure laparoscopic donor hepatectomy (PLDH), with most undergoing right hepatectomy. None of the 60 donors who underwent PLDH had intraoperative complications and none required transfusions, reoperation, or conversion to open hepatectomy. Forty-five donors who underwent PLDRH between November 2015 and December 2016 were compared with 42 who underwent conventional donor right hepatectomy (CDRH) between May 2013 and February 2014. The total operation time was longer (330.7 vs 280.0 minutes; P < .001) and the percentage with multiple bile duct openings was higher (53.3% vs 26.2%; P = .010) in the PLDRH group. However, the length of postoperative hospital stay (8.4 vs 8.2 days; P = .495) and rate of complications (11.9% vs 8.9%; P = .733) and re-hospitalizations (4.8% vs 4.4%; P = 1.000) were similar in both groups. PLDH, including PLDRH, is feasible when performed by a highly experienced surgeon and transplant team. Further evaluation, including long-term results, may support these preliminary findings of comparative outcomes for donors undergoing PLDRH and CDRH.

Cytokine Polymorphisms and Susceptibility to Severe Infectious Diseases

Cytokines are key regulators of the host response to infection, controlling the inflammatory reaction which is an essential component of the defense mechanisms. The major importance of these proteins in the pathogenesis and outcome of infectious diseases has been clearly demonstrated. In humans, there is increasing evidence that the host's cytokine response is genetically determined and that the genetic variability of cytokines underlies the complexity of interindividual differences in the immune response to micro organism invasions. We review the influence of host cytokine gene on the susceptibility to and the severity of parasitic, bacterial and viral infections. Proinflammatory cytokine polymorphisms are discussed in detail because of their importance in the course of severe infections such as meningococcal disease, cerebral malaria and septic shock. Genetic variants of the IL-10 gene, an antiinflammatory cytokine appear to be responsible for an uncontrolled and intense CARS and may have also dramatic consequences as an overwhelming inflammatory response. Our greater understanding of the genetic factors that influence mortality and morbidity of infectious diseases will permit identification of genomic markers which may be required for risk stratification of patients targeted for novel immunomodulatory treatments helping clinicians to select the most appropriate treatment options for their patients.

Detection of airborne rhinovirus and its relation to outdoor air supply in office environments.

Rhinoviruses are major causes of morbidity in patients with respiratory diseases; however, their modes of transmission are controversial. We investigated detection of airborne rhinovirus in office environments by polymerase chain reaction technology and related detection to outdoor air supply rates. We sampled air from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. each workday, with each sample run for 1 work week. We directly extracted RNA from the filters for nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of rhinovirus. Nasal lavage samples from building occupants with upper respiratory infections were also collected. Indoor carbon dioxide (CO2 concentrations were recorded every 10 minutes as a surrogate for outdoor air supply. To increase the range of CO2 concentrations, we adjusted the outdoor air supply rates every 3 months. Generalized additive models demonstrated an association between the probability of detecting airborne rhinovirus and a weekly average CO2 concentration greater than approximately 100 ppm, after controlling for covariates. In addition, one rhinovirus from a nasal lavage contained an identical nucleic acid sequence similar to that in the building air collected during the same week. These results suggest that occupants in buildings with low outdoor air supply may have an increased risk of exposure to infectious droplet nuclei emanating from a fellow building occupant.

Comparison of clinical features of acute lower respiratory tract infections in infants with RSV/HRV infection, and incidences of subsequent wheezing or asthma in childhood

BACKGROUND: To compare the clinical characteristics of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) and to explore the relationship between the development of recurrent wheezing/asthma and RSV/ HRV infections in infancy. METHODS: Retrospective study was conducted to compare the clinical characteristics of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs). Hospitalized patients with ALRTIs from March 2007 to December 2016 were screened. Single RSV cases (s-RSV), single HRV cases (s-HRV), and cases who had co-infection with the two viruses were enrolled. Follow-up was performed to determine whether either specific respiratory virus infection was related to subsequent development of recurrent wheezing/asthma. RESULTS: The s-RSV children were the youngest (P = 0.021), they experienced the most serious condition (P < 0.001) and respiratory failure (P < 0.001), they also required highest demand of oxygen therapy (P < 0.001). And in s-RSV group, the incidence of development of recurrent wheezing was significantly higher in subgroup with the family history of wheezing than that without (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The s-RSV cases suffered from the worst severity of illness, respiratory failure and required highest demand of oxygen therapy. Recurrent wheezing was more common in s-RSV group with family history of wheezing than those without.

Identification of six new polymorphisms in the human coronavirus 229E receptor gene (aminopeptidase N/CD13)

Abstract Objective: Human aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13/ANPEP) has been identified as the receptor for human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E. In this study, we analyzed the region of the APN gene that encodes a stretch of amino acid residues, essential for its HCoV-229E receptor function (amino acids 260–353). Methods: Full-length APN exon 3, intron 3 and exon 4, was PCR-amplified and sequenced in DNA samples from 100 unrelated Caucasian Belgian healthy volunteers. Results: We identified seven polymorphisms, including four intron 3 and three exon 4 variations. Apart from the already known C956T exon 4 mutation, the six other polymorphisms have not yet been described. The most prevalent APN variations in this population (C956T leading to an alanine to valine substitution, G978T, G987A and intron3-C389T) always occurred together at an allele frequency of 8.5%. Haploid DNA sequencing demonstrated the presence of these four variations on the same allele. Three polymorphisms in intron 3, intron3-G395C, intron3-C86T, and intron3-C429T, were identified with an allele frequency of 3.5%, 1% and 0.5% respectively. Five haplotypes were identified in the population of 100 individuals. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that there is a relatively broad spectrum of variations in the APN domain critical for coronavirus binding. The nucleotide sequence reported here has been submitted to the GenBank database with the following accession number: AF527789.

Pharmacy's Call for Authorities to Aggressively Enforce Laws Addressing Price Gouging.

Early reports of potential treatment for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have raised concerns related to pharmaceutical distribution. Despite the lack of high-quality evidence, the mere hope of effectiveness of potential treatments, such as hydroxychloroquine, has led to surges in demand for these products, and many pharmacists are already informally reporting shortages through social channels. As manufacturers and wholesale distributors struggle to fulfill orders for drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, short-term price increases may seem reasonable in a free market when demand increases. However, any price increases by manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and pharmacies might be seen as exploitive gouging of consumers during a declared emergency. In addition to concerns of price gouging, increases in prescription drug utilization during the pandemic may lead to increases in spending for all payers as members may be treated for COVID-19. This article explores pharmaceutical supply chain and drug pricing nuances that may cause problems for payers and pharmacies as the country battles this global pandemic. DISCLOSURES: No funding supported the writing of this article. Mattingly reports unrelated consulting fees from the National Health Council, Bristol Myers Squibb, G&W Laboratories, Allergy and Asthma Foundation of American, and the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission. Hogue has nothing to disclose.

The Host Interactome of Influenza Virus Presents New Potential Targets for Antiviral Drugs

Increasing antiviral drug resistance is a major concern for treating influenza, especially in a pandemic setting when the availability of a protective vaccine is uncertain. Resistance is often an issue with drugs directed at viral proteins and for small RNA viruses there are also a limited number of viral proteins that are amenable to inhibition by a small molecule. A new approach that is gaining support is that cellular proteins, which facilitate virus replication, may be used as alternative targets. Whereas drugs directed at viral proteins tend to be virus-specific, drugs directed at host targets have the potential to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity as many viruses may share a dependency on that host function. For influenza virus, we have very limited knowledge of which cellular factors are involved in virus replication, let alone which of these have suitable properties to serve as drug targets. Through the use of high-throughput RNA interference screens, several studies have addressed this gap in our knowledge. The resulting datasets provide new insight into host pathways that are involved in the influenza virus replication cycle and identify specific host factors in these pathways that may serve as potential targets for future antiviral drug development.

The use of non-invasive ventilation during acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia

Abstract The use of non-invasive ventilation in patients with community-acquired pneumonia is controversial since this is associated with high rates of treatment failure, compared with other causes of severe acute respiratory failure. The populations of patients with community-acquired pneumonia who have demonstrated better response to non-invasive ventilation are those with previous cardiac or respiratory disease, particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. By contrast, the use of non-invasive ventilation in patients with community-acquired pneumonia without these pre-existing diseases should be very cautious and under strict monitoring conditions, since there are increasing evidences that the unnecessary delay in intubation of those patients who fail treatment with non-invasive ventilation is associated with lower survival. Pulmonary complications of immunosuppressed patients are associated with high rates of intubation and mortality. The use of non-invasive ventilation in these patients may decrease the need for intubation and improve the poor outcome associated with these complications. Continuous positive airway pressure has been used to treat acute respiratory failure in several conditions characterised by alveolar collapse. While this is extremely useful in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, the efficacy in pneumonia seems limited to immunosuppressed patients with pulmonary complications. Conversely, there are no sufficient evidences on the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure in immunocompetent patients with pneumonia and severe acute respiratory failure.

Finding equipoise: CEPI revises its equitable access policy

Launched at Davos in January 2017 with funding from sovereign investors and philanthropic institutions, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organisations whose mission is to stimulate, finance and co-ordinate vaccine development against diseases with epidemic potential in cases where market incentives fail. As of December 2019, CEPI has committed to investing up to $706 million in vaccine development. This includes 19 vaccine candidates against its priority pathogens (Lassa fever virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Nipah virus, Chikungunya, Rift Valley fever) and three vaccine platforms to develop vaccines against Disease X, a novel or unanticipated pathogen. As an entity largely supported by public funds, ensuring equitable access to vaccines whose development it supports in low- and middle-income countries is CEPI's primary focus. CEPI developed an initial equitable access policy shortly after its formation, with key stakeholders expressing strong views about its content and prescriptive nature. The CEPI board instructed that it be revisited after a year. This paper describes the process of revising the policy, and how key issues were resolved. CEPI will continue to take an iterative, rather than prescriptive, approach to its policy-one that reflects the needs of multiple stakeholders and ensures it can meet its equitable access goals.

Phase I Clinical Trial of Autologous Ascites-derived Exosomes Combined With GM-CSF for Colorectal Cancer

Exosomes are small membrane vesicles that are secreted by a multitude of cell types. The exosomes derived from dendritic cells (Dex), tumor cells (Tex), and malignant effusions demonstrate immunomodulatory functions, and are even under clinical trial for cancer treatments. In this study we report the phase I clinical trial of the ascites-derived exosomes (Aex) in combination with the granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the immunotherapy of colorectal cancer (CRC). The Aex isolated by sucrose/D2O density gradient ultracentrifugation are 60–90-nm vesicles that contain the diverse immunomodulatory markers of exosomes and tumor-associated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Totally 40 patients (HLA-A0201+CEA+) with advanced CRC were enrolled in the study, and randomly assigned to treatments with Aex alone or Aex plus GM-CSF. Patients in both groups received a total of four subcutaneous immunizations at weekly intervals. We found that both therapies were safe and well tolerated, and that Aex plus GM-CSF but not Aex alone can induce beneficial tumor-specific antitumor cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. Therefore, our study suggests that the immunotherapy of CRC with Aex in combination with GM-CSF is feasible and safe, and thus can serve as an alternative choice in the immunotherapy of advanced CRC.

Activation of AP-1 signal transduction pathway by SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein

Abstract In March 2003, a novel coronavirus was isolated from patients exhibiting atypical pneumonia and subsequently proven to be the causative agent of the disease now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The complete genome of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has since been sequenced. The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (SARS-CoV N) shares little homology with other members of the coronavirus family. To determine if the N protein is involved in the regulation of cellular signal transduction, an ELISA-based assay on transcription factors was used. We found that the amount of transcription factors binding to promoter sequences of c-Fos, ATF2, CREB-1, and FosB was increased by the expression of SARS-CoV N. Since these factors are related to AP-1 signal transduction pathway, we investigated whether the AP-1 pathway was activated by SARS-CoV N protein using the PathDetect system. The results demonstrated that the expression of N protein, not the membrane protein (M), activated AP-1 pathway. We also found that SARS-CoV N protein does not activate NF-κB pathway, demonstrating that activation of important cellular pathways by SAS-CoV N protein is selective. Thus our data for the first time indicate that SARS-CoV has encoded a strategy to regulate cellular signaling process.

Impact of rotavirus vaccine on rotavirus genotypes and caliciviruses circulating in French cattle

Group A rotaviruses are a leading cause of neonatal calf diarrhoea worldwide and prevention of this disease includes vaccination against these viruses. In order to highlight the potential selection of rotavirus genotypes due to immune pressure driven by vaccination, the aim of this study was to compare group A rotavirus genotypes circulating in French diarrhoeic calves in rotavirus vaccinated herds (G6P[5] vaccine) with those in non-vaccinated herds during one calving season in 2010. This study showed a high prevalence of rotavirus in both groups with no significant difference between the two. No significant differences regarding G, P and G/P rotavirus genotype distribution between the two groups were observed, with G6, P[5] and G6P[5] genotypes being by far the most prevalent. Moreover, sequence analyses of the VP7 and VP4 partial coding genes of the G6P[5] strains from this study did not allow us to distinguish them according to their origin. This study also showed that other pathogens responsible for calf diarrhoea, such as genogroup III noroviruses and neboviruses, were not more frequently associated with calf diarrhoea in vaccinated herds. Altogether, these results suggest that the studied vaccine did not promote the emergence of rotavirus genotypes or variants different from those of the vaccine or other viruses responsible for calf diarrhoea, such as caliciviruses.

Nonrestorative Sleep, Musculoskeletal Pain, Fatigue in Rheumatic Disorders, and Allied Syndromes: A Historical Perspective

This chapter provides a historical perspective of the notion that the sleeping–waking brain is intimately related to complaints of unrefreshing sleep, widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and suffering. Such a constellation of symptoms extend from the remote biblical past, and involve various religious and cultural belief systems up to the recent evolution in Western medicine application of scientific methods for classification of illness. The contemporary application of scientific principles is directed to the etiology of diseases and to derive procedures for the management of such ill-understood illnesses. Historically, this constellation of rheumatic pain and fatigue symptoms have been given ever-changing medical and psychiatric labels that have been devoid of satisfactory medical understanding. In this chapter, the hypothesis that the sleeping/waking brain is integral to the somatic and behavioral symptoms of these disabling rheumatic chronic illness, termed fibromyalgia and various allied disorders, that are being examined and treated by a variety of health care professionals. Contemporary advances in mechanisms of how the sleeping–waking brain connects to these somatic and behavioral symptoms are reviewed. Potential avenues for further scientific understanding are described. Advances in such understanding are influencing current pharmacological and behavioral management of these suffering patients.

Antibody-mediated protection against MERS-CoV in the murine model

Abstract Murine antisera with neutralising activity for the coronavirus causative of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) were induced by immunisation of Balb/c mice with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral Spike protein. The murine antisera induced were fully-neutralising in vitro for two separate clinical strains of the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). To test the neutralising capacity of these antisera in vivo, susceptibility to MERS-CoV was induced in naive recipient Balb/c mice by the administration of an adenovirus vector expressing the human DPP4 receptor (Ad5-hDPP4) for MERS-CoV, prior to the passive transfer of the RBD-specific murine antisera to the transduced mice. Subsequent challenge of the recipient transduced mice by the intra-nasal route with a clinical isolate of the MERS-CoV resulted in a significantly reduced viral load in their lungs, compared with transduced mice receiving a negative control antibody. The murine antisera used were derived from mice which had been primed sub-cutaneously with a recombinant fusion of RBD with a human IgG Fc tag (RBD-Fc), adsorbed to calcium phosphate microcrystals and then boosted by the oral route with the same fusion protein in reverse micelles. The data gained indicate that this dual-route vaccination with novel formulations of the RBD-Fc, induced systemic and mucosal anti-viral immunity with demonstrated in vitro and in vivo neutralisation capacity for clinical strains of MERS-CoV.

The Efficacy of Albumin Dialysis in the Reversal of Refractory Vasoplegic Shock Due to Amlodipine Toxicity

OBJECTIVES: Calcium channel blockers are highly protein-bound medications frequently used in the management of hypertension. Overdose results in severe hypotension and is the fourth most common cause of toxicity-related deaths in the United States. Management is mostly supportive, with currently no standard role for targeted drug removal. The protein-bound nature of these medications presents the option of utilizing albumin dialysis for their removal and for the reversal of associated shock. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We present two cases of life-threatening intentional amlodipine overdoses successfully treated with albumin dialysis. Both patients experienced profound distributive shock in the setting of preserved cardiac contractility that was refractory to maximal vasoactive agent support. INTERVENTIONS AND RESULTS: After initiation of albumin dialysis, the patients showed rapid hemodynamic improvement and were able to be weaned off vasopressor support. CONCLUSIONS: These cases demonstrate the safety and efficacy of albumin dialysis in the management of near-fatal calcium channel blocker overdoses related to amlodipine and offer an additional therapeutic option apart from conventional supportive care. Importantly, these cases were not associated with impaired cardiac contractility, thereby making venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation a less preferable option. Furthermore, this therapeutic benefit of albumin dialysis can potentially be extended to the management of toxicity related to other highly protein-bound drugs and toxins.

COVID-19 (Sars-cov 2/Koronavirüs-19) tedavisinde klinikte kullanilan geleneksel Çin tibbi bitkileri ve kardiyovasküler sisteme etkileri./ Traditional Chinese medicine practices used in COVID-19 (Sars-cov 2/Coronavirus-19) treatment in clinic and their effects on the cardiovascular system

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of plants used in the formulations of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which were also used in clinical trials to treat patients with the novel coronavirus COVID-19, and to assess their effects on the cardiovascular system. METHODS: A literature review of PubMed, ResearchGate, ScienceDirect, the Cochrane Library, and TCM monographs was conducted and the effects of the plants on the cardiovascular system and the mechanisms of action in COVID-19 treatment were evaluated. RESULTS: The mechanism of action, cardiovascular effects, and possible toxicity of 10 plants frequently found in TCM formulations that were used in the clinical treatment of COVID-19 were examined. CONCLUSION: TCM formulations that had been originally developed for earlier viral diseases have been used in COVID-19 treatment. Despite the effectiveness seen in laboratory and animal studies with the most commonly used plants in these formulations, the clinical studies are currently insufficient according to standard operating procedures. More clinical studies are needed to understand the safe clinical use of traditional plants.

Metrics of early childhood growth in recent epidemiological research: A scoping review.

Metrics to quantify child growth vary across studies of the developmental origins of health and disease. We conducted a scoping review of child growth studies in which length/height, weight or body mass index (BMI) was measured at ≥ 2 time points. From a 10% random sample of eligible studies published between Jan 2010-Jun 2016, and all eligible studies from Oct 2015-June 2016, we classified growth metrics based on author-assigned labels (e.g., 'weight gain') and a 'content signature', a numeric code that summarized the metric's conceptual and statistical properties. Heterogeneity was assessed by the number of unique content signatures, and label-to-content concordance. In 122 studies, we found 40 unique metrics of childhood growth. The most common approach to quantifying growth in length, weight or BMI was the calculation of each child's change in z-score. Label-to-content discordance was common due to distinct content signatures carrying the same label, and because of instances in which the same content signature was assigned multiple different labels. In conclusion, the numerous distinct growth metrics and the lack of specificity in the application of metric labels challenge the integration of data and inferences from studies investigating the determinants or consequences of variations in childhood growth.

Mouse Hepatitis Coronavirus RNA Replication Depends on GBF1-Mediated ARF1 Activation

Coronaviruses induce in infected cells the formation of double membrane vesicles, which are the sites of RNA replication. Not much is known about the formation of these vesicles, although recent observations indicate an important role for the endoplasmic reticulum in the formation of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) replication complexes (RCs). We now show that MHV replication is sensitive to brefeldin A (BFA). Consistently, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ARF1, known to mimic the action of the drug, inhibited MHV infection profoundly. Immunofluorescence analysis and quantitative electron microscopy demonstrated that BFA did not block the formation of RCs per se, but rather reduced their number. MHV RNA replication was not sensitive to BFA in MDCK cells, which are known to express the BFA-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1. Accordingly, individual knockdown of the Golgi-resident targets of BFA by transfection of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) showed that GBF1, but not BIG1 or BIG2, was critically involved in MHV RNA replication. ARF1, the cellular effector of GBF1, also appeared to be involved in MHV replication, as siRNAs targeting this small GTPase inhibited MHV infection significantly. Collectively, our results demonstrate that GBF1-mediated ARF1 activation is required for efficient MHV RNA replication and reveal that the early secretory pathway and MHV replication complex formation are closely connected.

The quantification of bisphenols and their analogues in wastewaters and surface water by an improved solid-phase extraction gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method

The study focused on the application of GC in the quantitative analysis of bisphenols and their analogues (12 analytes), and the improvement of solid-phase extraction for the whole water analysis of complex water samples. The role of silylation in the qualitative and quantitative analysis of bisphenols was investigated. Partial degradation occurred for selected targets during hot injection with the presence of a silylation agent. A PSA (primary and secondary amines) sorbent placed on the top of the solid-phase extraction (SPE) column sorbent was found to be a matrix component trap, mostly for humic acids. The whole water analysis was performed by washing the filters with methanol and recycling the extract to the sample. The validation of SPE-GC/MS(SIM) gave limits of detection of 1-50 ng/L for ten target bisphenols with a method recovery of between 87 and 133%. The application of the method was tested by the analysis of wastewater sampled from three wastewater treatment plants located in Poland, and municipal surface waters. The only analytes found were BPA and BPS, within the range of 16-1465 ng/L and < MDL-1249 ng/L in wastewater, and 170-3113 ng/L and < MDL-1584 ng/L in surface water, respectively.

Illegal import of bushmeat and other meat products into Switzerland on commercial passenger flights.

Illegal imports of meat can present substantial risks to public and animal health. Several European countries have reported considerable quantities of meat imported on commercial passenger flights. The objective of this study was to estimate the quantity of meat illegally imported into Switzerland, with a separate estimation for bushmeat. Data were obtained by participation in intervention exercises at Swiss international airports and by analysing data on seizures during the four-year period 2008 to 2011. The study revealed that a wide array of animal species was imported into Switzerland. From the database, the average annual weight of meat seized during the period analysed was 5.5 tonnes, of which 1.4% was bushmeat. However, in a stochastic model the total annual inflow of illegal meat imports was estimated at 1,013 tonnes (95% CI 226 to 4,192) for meat and 8.6 tonnes (95% CI 0.8 to 68.8) for bushmeat. Thus, even for a small European country such as Switzerland the quantities of illegally imported meat and meat products are substantial and the consequences for public and animal health could be high. To reduce the risk, it is essential that surveillance at European airports is harmonised and that passenger information campaigns clarify the consequences of the illegal import of meat, particularly bushmeat.

Digital health and the COVID-19 epidemic: an assessment framework for apps from an epidemiological and legal perspective.

As COVID-19 spreads across the globe, crowdsourced digital technology harbours the potential to improve surveillance and epidemic control, primarily through increased information coverage, higher information speed, fast case tracking and improved proximity tracing. Targeting those aims, COVID-19-related smartphone and web-based health applications are continuously emerging, leading to a multitude of options, raising ethical and legal challenges and potentially overwhelming end users. Building on an existing trustworthiness checklist for digital health applications, we searched the literature and developed a framework to guide the assessment of smartphone and web-based applications that aim to contribute to controlling the current epidemic or mitigating its effects. It further integrates epidemiological subject knowledge and a legal analysis, outlining the mechanisms through which new applications can support the fight against COVID-19. The resulting framework includes 40 questions across 8 domains on “purpose”, “usability”, “information accuracy”, “organisational attributes / reputation”, “transparency”, “privacy” and “user control / self-determination”. All questions should be primarily answerable from publicly available data, as provided by application manufacturers. The framework aims to guide end users in choosing a transparent, safe and valuable application and suggests a set of information items that developers ideally make available to allow a balanced judgement and facilitate the trustworthiness of their products.

Respiratory viral infection in exacerbations of COPD

Summary Background Patients with COPD have frequent exacerbations. The role of respiratory viral infection is just emerging. We wished to determine prospectively the incidence of viral infection in exacerbated and stable COPD patients as well as smokers who do not have airways obstruction. Methods Stable and exacerbated COPD patients were recruited along with a group of patients who had smoked but who did not have any airways obstruction. Spirometry was performed and sputum specimens were tested for a range of 12 different respiratory viruses using PCR. Results One hundred and thirty-six patients with exacerbations of COPD, 68 stable COPD patients and 16 non-obstructed smokers were recruited. A respiratory virus was detected in 37% of exacerbations, 12% of stable COPD patients and 12% of non-obstructed smokers, p <0.0005. Rhinovirus was most frequently detected. The symptom of fever was associated with virus detection, p <0.05. Infection with more than one virus was only found in the exacerbated COPD patients. Conclusion Respiratory viral infection is associated with exacerbations of COPD. Rhinovirus was the most common infecting agent identified and in two cases human metapneumovirus was also detected. Dual infections were only seen amongst those patients admitted to hospital with acute exacerbations of COPD. Viruses were more commonly detected in those with more severe airways disease.

The benyvirus RNA silencing suppressor is essential for long-distance movement, requires both zinc-finger and NoLS basic residues but not a nucleolar localization for its silencing-suppression activity.

The RNA silencing-suppression properties of Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) and Beet soil-borne mosaic virus (BSBMV) cysteine-rich p14 proteins have been investigated. Suppression of RNA silencing activities were made evident using viral infection of silenced Nicotiana benthamiana 16C, N. benthamiana agroinfiltrated with green fluorescent protein (GFP), and GF-FG hairpin triggers supplemented with viral suppressor of RNA silencing (VSR) constructs or using complementation of a silencing-suppressor-defective BNYVV virus in Chenopodium quinoa. Northern blot analyses of small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in agroinfiltration tests revealed reduced amounts of siRNA, especially secondary siRNA, suggesting that benyvirus VSR act downstream of the siRNA production. Using confocal laser-scanning microscopy imaging of infected protoplasts expressing functional p14 protein fused to an enhanced GFP reporter, we showed that benyvirus p14 accumulated in the nucleolus and the cytoplasm independently of other viral factors. Site-directed mutagenesis showed the importance of the nucleolar localization signal embedded in a C4 zinc-finger domain in the VSR function and intrinsic stability of the p14 protein. Conversely, RNA silencing suppression appeared independent of the nucleolar localization of the protein, and a correlation between BNYVV VSR expression and long-distance movement was established.

Premature infants born at <25 weeks of gestation may be compromised by currently recommended resuscitation techniques.

AIM Standard resuscitation guidelines are based on data from a range of gestational ages. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of our delivery room resuscitation protocol across a range of gestational ages in preterm infants born at <29 weeks. METHODS We performed an observational study of prospectively collected video recordings of 73 preterm infants. The percentage of bradycardic patients, time to reach target oxygen saturation and the extent of all interventions were compared between three gestational age groups: 22-24 weeks (n = 22), 25-26 weeks (n = 27) and 27-28 weeks (n = 24). RESULTS Although the same resuscitation protocol was followed for all infants, bradycardic infants born <25 weeks responded poorly and required significantly longer to reach oxygen saturation targets of >70%, >80% and >90% (p < 0.03). They required significantly more interventions and had higher rate of death (p < 0.05) and severe intraventricular haemorrhage (p < 0.03). Significantly lower heart rate and oxygen saturation values were found in infants with intraventricular haemorrhage. CONCLUSION Current recommendations for resuscitation may fail to achieve timely lung aeration in infants born at the borderline of viability, leading to higher mortality and morbidity. Sustained inflation and delayed cord clamping may be effective alternatives.

Are non‐allergenic environmental factors important in asthma?

OBJECTIVE: To review the roles of viral respiratory tract infections, environmental tobacco smoke and air pollution in asthma. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (1992‐1995) searches were conducted for publications on asthma, environmental tobacco smoke, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and particulates. STUDY SELECTION: Representative original experimental and epidemiological studies and reviews of viral infections in asthma. DATA SYNTHESIS: Respiratory virus infections are the most common and important trigger of asthma attacks in children and probably also in adults. Their role in promoting development of asthma is not so clear. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is almost certainly responsible for some cases of childhood asthma, and can also trigger symptoms of bronchoconstriction in adults with asthma. Exposure to ozone or nitrogen dioxide is associated with symptoms, impaired lung function, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and hospital presentations for asthma. These pollutants may also act as cofactors in the development of allergen‐specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Research on preventing upper respiratory viral infections may reduce asthma morbidity. The move to non‐smoking workplaces is welcome, but new interventions are needed to prevent young women taking up smoking and subsequently exposing their children. The ambient air quality guideline for ozone should be revised and a health‐based guideline for respirable particulates introduced.

Mechanism of PM2.5-induced human bronchial epithelial cell toxicity in central China

Exposure to PM2.5 has been linked to respiratory disorders, yet knowledge of the molecular mechanism is limited. Here, PM2.5 was monitored and collected in central China, and its cytotoxicity mechanism on human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) was investigated. With the average concentration of 109â¯±â¯69â¯µg/m3, PM2.5 was rich in heavy metals and organic pollutants. After exposure to PM2.5, the viability of BEAS-2B cells decreased, where 510 dysregulated genes were predicted to induce necroptosis via inhibiting ATP synthesis through the oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway. Cellular experiments demonstrated that the content of ATP was downregulated, while the expression of RIP3, a necroptosis indicator, was upregulated. Besides, four enzymes in charge of ATP synthesis were downregulated, including ATP5F, NDUF, COX7A, and UQCR, while two genes of RELA and CAPN1 responsible for necroptosis were upregulated. Furthermore, N-acetylcysteine was applied as an enhancer for ATP synthesis, which reversed the downregulation of ATP5F, NDUF, and COX7A, and consequently alleviated the elevation of RELA, CAPN1, and RIP3. In conclusion, PM2.5 exposure downregulates ATP5F, NDUF, COX7A, and UQCR, and that inhibits ATP synthesis via the oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway, which subsequently upregulates RELA and CAPN1 and ultimately leads to necroptosis of BEAS-2B cells.

Activity of a purified His-tagged 3C-like proteinase from the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus

Abstract Previous studies in vitro of the processing of cloned polyprotein fragments from the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) large open reading frame (ORF1), confirmed the activity of a predicted 3C-like proteinase (3CLP) domain and suggested that the proteinase is released autocatalytically from the polyprotein in the form of a 35 kDa protein, 3CLpro, capable of further cleavages in trans. In order to identify such cleavages within the ORF1 polyprotein mediated by 3CLpro, the proteinase was expressed in bacteria, purified and used in trans cleavage assays with polyprotein fragments lacking the 3CLP domain as targets. The proteinase was expressed as a polyprotein fragment which was able to process during expression in bacterial cells, releasing mature 3CLpro. A histidine (His6) tag was introduced close to the C-terminus of the proteinase to aid purification. Processing demonstrated by the tagged proteinase was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type enzyme indicating that the site chosen for the tag was permissive. From these studies we were able to demonstrate trans cleavages consistent with the use of most of the previously predicted or identified sites within the open reading frame of gene 1. This tentatively completes the processing map for the ORF1 region with respect to 3CLpro.

Transcleral approach for closing retinal tears using DuraSeal™ hydrogel sealant.

PURPOSE The aim of this study was to evaluate an innovative approach for closing retinal tears using DuraSeal™ (DS) hydrogel sealant in a rabbit model. METHODS Retinal detachment with a small tear was performed on 20 New Zealand rabbits. Thereafter, rabbits were divided into two groups; the experimental group received a transscleral injection of 0.1 ml DS into the subretinal space whereas the control group received sham injection of saline. Eyes were clinically evaluated using indirect ophthalmoscopy, retinal function was recorded in ten rabbits by electroretinography and the sealant's toxicity was evaluated histopathologically. RESULTS We found that the DS hydrogel was easily injected transsclerally into the subretinal space of the detached retinas with no major complications. Retinal reattachment was seen in both groups within 2 weeks with no toxicity to the sensory retina. There were no significant differences in retinal function between groups. CONCLUSION Subretinal injection of hydrogel through a transscleral route is easy to perform and may open a new avenue in the treatment of retinal detachment. However, the efficacy of the DS as a tamponade for sealing retinal tear is yet to be definite. Long-term clinical, functional, and toxicological studies are needed to evaluate its full potential for clinical applications.

Muscle activation and energy-requirements for varying postures in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy.

OBJECTIVE To determine energy expenditure and muscle activity among children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP), across several conditions that approximate sedentary behavior, and standing. STUDY DESIGN Subjects with spastic CP (n = 19; 4-20 years of age; Gross Motor Function Classification System Expanded and Revised [GMFCS-E&R] levels I-V) participated in this cohort study. Energy-expenditure and muscle activity were measured during lying supine, sitting with support, sitting without support, and standing. Energy-expenditure was measured using indirect calorimetry and expressed in metabolic equivalents (METs). Muscle activation was recorded using surface electromyography. The recorded values were calculated for every child and then averaged per posture. RESULTS Mean energy expenditure was >1.5 METs during standing for all GMFCS-E&R levels. There was a nonsignificant trend for greater muscle activation for all postures with less support. Only for children classified at GMFCS-E&R level III did standing result in significantly greater muscle activation (P < .05) compared with rest. CONCLUSIONS Across all GMFCS-E&R levels, children and adolescents with CP had elevated energy expenditure during standing that exceeded the sedentary threshold of 1.5 METs. Our findings suggest that changing a child's position to standing may contribute to the accumulation of light activity and reduction of long intervals of sedentary behavior.

The amount of cytokine-release defines different shades of Sars-Cov2 infection

The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID 19), spreading from China all around the world in early 2020, has led scientists to investigate the immuno-mediated mechanisms underlying the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection. Depending on the amount of cytokines released as the result of the immunological activation induced by SARS-CoV2, three major clinical phenotypes can be identified: "mild",symbolized as a "drizzle" of cytokines, severe as a "storm", and critical as a "hurricane". In patients with mild symptoms, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines is balanced to obtain a defense response against the virus which is often self-limiting and overcomes without tissue damage. In severe phenotype, resembling a "cytokine-release syndrome", SARS-CoV2 causes the lysis of the immune-mediators leading to a cytokine storm able to induce lung epithelium damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In critical patients, the immune response may become uncontrolled, thus the cytokine burst resembles a form of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis which may result in a multi organ failure. In addition to the standard of care, an immune-modulatory therapy tailored to each one of the different phenotypes should be used in order to prevent or reduce the release of cytokines responsible for organ damage and disease progression.

Vaccines in a hurry

Abstract Preparing populations for health threats, including threats from new or re-emerging infectious diseases is recognised as an important public health priority. The development, production and application of emergency vaccinations are the important measures against such threats. Vaccines are cost-effective tools to prevent disease, and emergency vaccines may be the only means to prevent a true disaster for global society in the event of a new pandemic with potential to cause morbidity and mortality comparable to the Spanish flu, the polio epidemics in the 1950s, or the SARS outbreak in 2003 if its spread had not been contained in time. Given the early recognition of a new threat, and given the advances of biotechnology, vaccinology and information systems, it is not an unrealistic goal to have promising prototype vaccine candidates available in a short time span following the identification of a new infectious agent; this is based on the assumption that the emerging infection is followed by natural immunity. However, major bottlenecks for the deployment of emergency vaccine are lack of established systems for fast-track regulatory approval of such candidates and limited international vaccine production capacity. In the present discussion paper, we propose mechanisms to facilitate development of emergency vaccines in Europe by focusing on public–private scientific partnerships, fast-track approval of emergency vaccine by regulatory agencies and proposing incentives for emergency vaccine production in private vaccine companies.

Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection and the risk for cancer

The current SARS-CoV-2 has put significant strain on healthcare services worldwide due to acute COVID-19. However, the potential long-term effects of this infection haven't been extensively discussed. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to cause persistent infection in some individuals, and should this be the case, that in a few years we may see a rise in cancer incidence due to carcinogenic effects of this coronavirus. Non-retroviral RNA viruses such as Coronaviridae have been shown to cause persistent infection in hosts. Empirical evidence of viral genomic material shedding weeks after apparent clinical and laboratorial resolution of COVID-19 may be an indirect proof for persistent viral infection. Furthermore, tropism towards certain immune-privileged territories may facilitate immune evasion by this virus. Structural homology with SARS-CoV-1 indicates that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to directly impair pRb and p53, which are key gatekeepers with tumor suppressor functions. Additionally, COVID-19 features preeminent inflammatory response with marked oxidative stress, which acts as both as initiator and promotor of carcinogenesis. Should there be a carcinogenic risk associated with SARS-CoV-2, the implications for public health are plenty, as infected patients should be closely watched during long periods of follow-up. Additional investigation to establish or exclude the possibility for persistent infection is paramount to identify and prevent possible complications in the future.

Gut microbiota and Covid-19- possible link and implications.

Covid-19 is a major pandemic facing the world today caused by SARS-CoV-2 which has implications on our understanding of infectious diseases. Although, SARS-Cov-2 primarily causes lung infection through binding of ACE2 receptors present on the alveolar epithelial cells, yet it was recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in the faeces of infected patients. Interestingly, the intestinal epithelial cells particularly the enterocytes of the small intestine also express ACE2 receptors. Role of the gut microbiota in influencing lung diseases has been well articulated. It is also known that respiratory virus infection causes perturbations in the gut microbiota. Diet, environmental factors and genetics play an important role in shaping gut microbiota which can influence immunity. Gut microbiota diversity is decreased in old age and Covid-19 has been mainly fatal in elderly patients which again points to the role the gut microbiota may play in this disease. Improving gut microbiota profile by personalized nutrition and supplementation known to improve immunity can be one of the prophylactic ways by which the impact of this disease can be minimized in old people and immune-compromised patients. More trials may be initiated to see the effect of co-supplementation of personalized functional food including prebiotics/probiotics along with current therapies.

Traumatic laryngotracheal stenosis treated by hyoid-sternohyoid osseomuscular flap combined with xenogenic acellular dermal matrix: A case report and literature review.

Objective The treatment of laryngotracheal stenosis is a major therapeutic challenge. Various treatments include observation, medical management, and surgical management. The most effective surgical management is resection and reconstruction. To the authors' knowledge, no reports have described the use of xenogenic acellular dermal matrix (ADM) for laryngotracheal stenosis. Methods A 27-year-old man presented with hemoptysis of the neck due to a traffic accident. Emergency orotracheal intubation was performed. Tracheostomy was then performed under local anesthesia. Computed tomography revealed fractures of the right thyroid cartilage and posterior arc of the cricoid cartilage and stenosis of the subglottis and first and second tracheal rings. We used a composite hyoid-sternohyoid osseomuscular flap with xenogenic ADM and a straight silicone tube as a lumen stent to reconstruct the laryngotracheal stenosis. Results Surgical recovery was uneventful. The tracheotomy opening was changed to a metal tube 5 days postoperatively. Four months postoperatively, the silicone tube was endoscopically removed under local anesthesia. The patient was decannulated 20 days later. The patient satisfied with his voice, respiration, and deglutition at the 16-month postoperative follow-up. Conclusion The use of ADM for laryngotracheal stenosis may reduce the growth of granulation tissues and promote the repair process.

Update: Severe Respiratory Illness Associated with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) — Worldwide, 2012–2013

CDC continues to work in consultation with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners to better understand the public health risk posed by the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), formerly known as novel coronavirus, which was first reported to cause human infection in September 2012. The continued reporting of new cases indicates that there is an ongoing risk for transmission to humans in the area of the Arabian Peninsula. New reports of cases outside the region raise concerns about importation to other geographic areas. Nosocomial outbreaks with transmission to health-care personnel highlight the importance of infection control procedures. Recent data suggest that mild respiratory illness might be part of the clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection, and presentations might not initially include respiratory symptoms. In addition, patients with comorbidities or immunosuppression might be at increased risk for infection, severe disease, or both. Importantly, the incubation period might be longer than previously estimated. Finally, lower respiratory tract specimens (e.g., sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial wash, or tracheal aspirate) should be collected in addition to nasopharyngeal sampling for evaluation of patients under investigation. An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) was recently issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow for expanded availability of diagnostic testing in the United States.

Asma infantil

El asma es la enfermedad crónica infantil más frecuente. El diagnóstico es fácil en la mayoría de las ocasiones por la aparición de episodios de disnea espiratoria con sibilancias reversibles espontáneamente o por el efecto de broncodilatadores. En el momento del diagnóstico, se requieren tres pruebas complementarias: las radiografías de tórax, las pruebas funcionales respiratorias y un estudio alergológico. El tratamiento de las exacerbaciones se basa en los beta2-adrenérgicos inhalados y, si es preciso, en la corticoterapia oral. El objetivo del tratamiento de fondo es mantener el control, prevenir las exacerbaciones y restaurar o mantener las funciones pulmonares normales. Se debe adaptar al nivel de control del asma y en él tiene un lugar destacado la corticoterapia inhalada y los broncodilatadores de acción prolongada. En los menores de tres años, el asma se diagnostica a partir de tres episodios de sibilancias. Se debe buscar la presencia de antecedentes particulares, de manifestaciones atípicas o persistentes y de anomalías en la radiografía de tórax para descartar las demás causas de manifestaciones sibilantes recidivantes. Cuando es necesario un tratamiento de fondo, se basa en la corticoterapia inhalada. Las cohortes prospectivas han permitido demostrar que la atopia, la gravedad clínica y la persistencia de una obstrucción clínica son los factores principales tanto de la persistencia como de la gravedad del asma durante la vida.

Interleukin-5, interleukin-6, interferon induced protein-10, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein among mechanically ventilated severe community-acquired viral and bacterial pneumonia patients

Abstract Background The serum cytokine levels among 45 mechanically ventilated, intensive care unit (ICU)-treated severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) patients with known microbial etiology in three different etiology groups were assessed. Methods Blood samples for C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin (IL)-5, IL-6, IL-10, human interferon gamma induced protein (IP)-10, and TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor alpha) were collected at time points 0, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after study inclusion. Results There were 21 (43%) pure bacterial infections (bacterial group, BG), 5 (10%) pure viral infections (viral group, VG), and 19 (39%) mixed bacterial-viral infections (mixed group, MG) among 45 mechanically ventilated SCAP patients. CRP and PCT levels were significantly higher in the MG and values decreased with time in all groups. PCT differed also in time and group analysis (P = 0.001), the highest being in the MG. IL-5 levels were significantly higher in the VG compared to others (Ptime = 0.001, Pgroup = 0.051 and Ptimexgroup = 0.016). IL-6 and IP-10 levels decreased over time (Ptime = 0.003 and Ptime = 0.021), but there were no differences between groups. Conclusion SCAP patients with viral etiology have higher IL-5 levels. Patients with mixed viral and bacterial group have higher PCT compared to other etiologies.

Descriptive study of severe hospitalized cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza during five epidemic seasons (2010–2015)

OBJECTIVE: The Plan of Information on Acute Respiratory Infections in Catalonia (PIDIRAC) included the surveillance of severe hospitalized cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza (SHCLCI) in 2009. The objective of this study was to determine the clinical, epidemiological and virological features of SHCLCI recorded in 12 sentinel hospitals during five influenza seasons. RESULTS: From a sample of SHCLCI recorded during the 5 influenza epidemics seasons from 2010–2011 to 2014–2015, Cases were confirmed by PCR and/or viral isolation in cell cultures from respiratory samples. A total of 1400 SHCLCI were recorded, 33% required ICU admission and 12% died. The median age of cases was 61 years (range 0–101 years); 70.5% were unvaccinated; 80.4% received antiviral treatment (in 79.6 and 24% of cases within 48 h after hospital admission and the onset of symptoms, respectively); influenza virus A [37.9% A (H1N1)pdm09, 29.3% A (H3N2)] was identified in 87.7% of cases. Surveillance of SHCLCI provides an estimate of the severity of seasonal influenza epidemics and the identification and characterization of at-risk groups in order to facilitate preventive measures such as vaccination and early antiviral treatment.

Simultaneous typing and HA/NA subtyping of influenza A and B viruses including the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 by multiplex real-time RT-PCR

Abstract Pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 and seasonal influenza viruses are currently co-circulating worldwide. A rapid, sensitive, and specific assay for distinguishing pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 from seasonal influenza viruses and for subtyping seasonal influenza A viruses could aid in the surveillance and control of these viral infections. Here, such a multiplex real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for typing influenza A and B viruses and the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 is developed. This assay can also subtype seasonal influenza A viruses simultaneously. The analytical sensitivity is 10–104 copies/reaction. The coefficients of variation of inter-assay and intra-assay are 0.04–0.45% and 0.08–0.97%, respectively. The new multiplex rRT-PCR assay is more sensitive in subtyping seasonal influenza viruses than the conventional PCR techniques. Results obtained with this assay for the detection of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 are highly consistent (96.88%) with those achieved using the US CDC's rRT-PCR protocol. A sample identified as “pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 positive” by the US CDC's rRT-PCR was reclassified correctly as subtype H3N2 using this assay. Taken together, this new multiplex rRT-PCR protocol could be an important tool for improving diagnosis and management of the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 and seasonal influenza viruses.

Self-assessment of the Thai Department of Disease Control's communication for international response to COVID-19 in the early phase

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the Thailand Department of Disease Control's (DDC) early responses to COVID-19 in respect to communication with the international community and to identify the manner of Thailand's response during public health emergencies. METHODS: Documents and international response communication from 4-31 January 2020 were reviewed and dates of responses were collected for descriptive analysis. A questionnaire was submitted to the DDC officers responsible for international coordination. A meeting to identify responses was held to evaluate the self-assessed capacities of the Department's international communication. RESULTS: Thailand began the COVID-19 screening protocol on 3 January 2020. International correspondence subsequently occurred continually either through the ASEAN or International Health Regulations (IHR) mechanisms. The total score of communication for international response was 88.9%. For IHR reporting duties, the median duration to respond was 2.49hours. Official news was sent within a mean of 9.18hours and the English daily situation reports were always uploaded onto the official website within 24hours. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a benchmark for international coordination and communication capacities and also identified areas for improvement during public health emergencies, such as the need to identify English-speaking spokespeople to communicate at an international level.

Management of umbilical hernia complicated with liver cirrhosis: an advocate of early and elective herniorrhaphy.

BACKGROUND Patients with umbilical hernias complicated by liver cirrhosis have an increased likelihood of complications following herniorrhaphy. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical outcomes in patients with umbilical hernias complicated by liver cirrhosis. METHODS Between 2001 and 2010, 44 patients were enrolled in this study. The comparison between non-operative and operative group was performed. Patients who underwent emergency versus elective surgery were also compared. RESULTS Of the 44 patients, there were 33 men and 11 women. Thirty-one patients (70.5%) underwent surgery and 13 patients (29.5%) were treated conservatively. Overall morbidity and mortality rates following herniorrhaphy were 42% and 6.5%. The mean albumin level was significantly lower and total bilirubin, creatinine and mean model of end-stage liver disease score were significantly higher in non-operative group than in operative group. Combined resection was performed more frequently in the emergency group than in elective group. A significantly higher proportion of patients in emergency operation group had postoperative complications (P=0.01), especially ascites (P=0.02). The operative time and postoperative hospital stay were significantly shorter in the elective operation group than in emergency operation group. CONCLUSIONS Early, elective repair of umbilical hernias in cirrhotic patients should be advocated considering the hepatic reserve and patient's condition. Ascites control is the mainstay of post-operative management.

AI-assisted CT imaging analysis for COVID-19 screening: Building and deploying a medical AI system in four weeks

The sudden outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) increased the diagnostic burden of radiologists. In the time of an epidemic crisis, we hoped artificial intelligence (AI) to help reduce physician workload in regions with the outbreak, and improve the diagnosis accuracy for physicians before they could acquire enough experience with the new disease. Here, we present our experience in building and deploying an AI system that automatically analyzes CT images to detect COVID-19 pneumonia features. Different from conventional medical AI, we were dealing with an epidemic crisis. Working in an interdisciplinary team of over 30 people with medical and / or AI background, geographically distributed in Beijing and Wuhan, we were able to overcome a series of challenges in this particular situation and deploy the system in four weeks. Using 1,136 training cases (723 positives for COVID-19) from five hospitals, we were able to achieve a sensitivity of 0.974 and specificity of 0.922 on the test dataset, which included a variety of pulmonary diseases. Besides, the system automatically highlighted all lesion regions for faster examination. As of today, we have deployed the system in 16 hospitals, and it is performing over 1,300 screenings per day.

Prediction of Novel Inhibitors of the Main Protease (M-pro) of SARS-CoV-2 through Consensus Docking and Drug Reposition

Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019 and its rapid spread worldwide, the scientific community has been under pressure to react and make progress in the development of an effective treatment against the virus responsible for the disease. Here, we implement an original virtual screening (VS) protocol for repositioning approved drugs in order to predict which of them could inhibit the main protease of the virus (M-pro), a key target for antiviral drugs given its essential role in the virus’ replication. Two different libraries of approved drugs were docked against the structure of M-pro using Glide, FRED and AutoDock Vina, and only the equivalent high affinity binding modes predicted simultaneously by the three docking programs were considered to correspond to bioactive poses. In this way, we took advantage of the three sampling algorithms to generate hypothetic binding modes without relying on a single scoring function to rank the results. Seven possible SARS-CoV-2 M-pro inhibitors were predicted using this approach: Perampanel, Carprofen, Celecoxib, Alprazolam, Trovafloxacin, Sarafloxacin and ethyl biscoumacetate. Carprofen and Celecoxib have been selected by the COVID Moonshot initiative for in vitro testing; they show 3.97 and 11.90% M-pro inhibition at 50 µM, respectively.

Experimental and numerical investigation of micro-environmental conditions in public transportation buses

Abstract This study examines both numerically and experimentally the micro-environmental conditions in public transportation buses. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was developed and experimentally validated. The developed CFD model was used to calculate the spatial distributions of the mean age and mean residual lifetime of air in the bus environment and evaluate the efficiency of the bus ventilation system. Additionally, the passengers’ exposures to a variety of environmental conditions were experimentally monitored in “real world” field campaigns using the Harvard University shuttle bus system. Real time continuous monitoring systems were used to assess indoor environmental quality in the buses. It was found that CO levels were very low, while the levels of particulate matter varied and were influenced by the ambient air penetrated into the bus through the operation of the doors and the ventilation system. The CO2 level was found elevated and greatly affected by occupancy conditions. The elevated CO2 level indicates that the current bus ventilation is insufficient to dilute air pollutants in the bus especially under heavy occupancy conditions. This lack of sufficient ventilation indicates an elevated risk for airborne transmitted diseases in such a popular public transportation system.

Comparison of Postoperative Pain and Recovery between Single-Port and Two-Port Thoracoscopic Lobectomy for Lung Cancer.

OBJECTIVE To investigate whether the single-port (SP) technique had more favorable postoperative outcomes than had the two-port (TP) technique. METHODS One hundred sixty-six single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (SP-VATS) lobectomy and 162 two-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (TP-VATS) lobectomy had been successfully completed between August 2015 and September 2016. A single incision of ∼3 cm was made in an intercostal space along the anterior axillary line. Perioperative outcomes and the safety between SP-VATS and TP-VATS lobectomy for NSCLC was compared. RESULTS In the SP-VATS group, incision size was kept to a minimum, with a median of 3 cm; mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed in all patients with malignancy. Overall, median operative time was 89 minutes, and median chest tube duration was 3.1 days. The VAS on postoperative days 3, 7, and 14 was less in the SP-VATS group than that in the TP-VATS group. The VAS on days 1, 30, 60, 90, 180, and 360 did not differ significantly between the two groups. The number of days of use of analgesic agents after surgery was less in the SP-VATS group. The pathological symptoms of wound pain were significantly less in the SP-VATS group. CONCLUSIONS Compared with the multiport approach, SP VATS lobectomy might reduce postoperative pain and lead to faster recovery.

Mof4-1 is an allele of the UPF1/IFS2 gene which affects both mRNA turnover and -1 ribosomal frameshifting efficiency.

The mof4-1 (maintenance of frame) allele in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated as a chromosomal mutation that increased the efficiency of -1 ribosomal frameshifting at the L-A virus frameshift site and caused loss of M1, the satellite virus of L-A. Here, we demonstrate that strains harboring the mof4-1 allele inactivated the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. The MOF4 gene was shown to be allelic to UPF1, a gene whose product is involved in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. Although cells harboring the mof4-1 allele of the UPF1 gene lose the M1 virus, mutations in other UPF genes involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay maintain the M1 virus. The mof4-1 strain is more sensitive to the aminoglycoside antibiotic paromomycin than a upf1 delta strain, and frameshifting efficiency increases in a mof4-1 strain grown in the presence of this drug. Further, the ifs1 and ifs2 alleles previously identified as mutations that enhance frameshifting were shown to be allelic to the UPF2 and UPF1 genes, respectively, and both ifs strains maintained M1. These results indicate that mof4-1 is a unique allele of the UPF1 gene and that the gene product of the mof4-1 allele affects both -1 ribosomal frameshifting and mRNA turnover.

Fostering Existential Maturity to Manage Terror in a Pandemic.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has created an environment in which existence is more fragile and existential fears or terror rises in people. Objective: Managing existential terror calls for being mature about mortality, something with which palliative care providers are familiar and in need of greater understanding. Methods: Using a case to illustrate, we describe existential terror, terror management, and existential maturity and go on to outline how existential maturity is important for not only the dying and the grieving but for also those facing risk of acquiring COVID-19. Results: Next, we describe how essential components in attaining existential maturity come together. (1) Because people experience absent attachment to important people as very similar to dying, attending to those experiences of relationship is essential. (2) That entails an internal working through of important relationships, knowing their incompleteness, until able to "hold them inside," and invest in these and other connections. (3) And what allows that is making a meaningful connection with someone around the experience of absence or death. (4) We also describe the crucial nature of a holding environment in which all of these can wobble into place. Discussion: Finally, we consider how fostering existential maturity would help populations face up to the diverse challenges that the pandemic brings up for people everywhere.

Early Recurrent Ischemic Lesions in Patients With Cryptogenic Stroke and Patent Foramen Ovale: An Observational Study.

Background: Randomized controlled trials indicate that patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure reduces risk of stroke recurrence in patients with cryptogenic stroke and PFO. However, the optimal time point for PFO closure is unknown and depends on the risk of stroke recurrence. Objective: We aimed to investigate risk of early new ischemic lesions on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in cryptogenic stroke patients with and without PFO. Methods: Cryptogenic stroke patients underwent serial MRI examinations within 1 week after symptom onset to detect early new ischemic lesions. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions were delineated, co-registered, and analyzed visually for new hyperintensities by raters blinded to clinical details. A PFO was classified as stroke-related in patients with PFO and a Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) score >5 points. Results: Out of 80 cryptogenic stroke patients, risk of early recurrent DWI lesions was not significantly different in cryptogenic stroke patients with and without PFO. Similar results were observed in patients ≤60 years of age. Patients with a stroke-related PFO even had a significantly lower risk of early recurrent ischemic lesions compared to all other patients with cryptogenic stroke (unadjusted odds ratio 0.23 [95% confidence interval 0.06-0.87], P = 0.030). Conclusion: Our data argue against a high risk of early stroke recurrence in patients with cryptogenic stroke and PFO.

Plasma Amino Acid Profile in Patients with Aortic Dissection.

Aortic dissection (AD), a severe cardiovascular disease with the characteristics of high mortality, is lack of specific clinical biomarkers. In order to facilitate the diagnosis of AD, we investigated plasma amino acid profile through metabolomics approach. Total 33 human subjects were enrolled in the study: 11 coronary heart disease (CHD) patients without aortic lesion and 11 acute AD and 11 chronic AD. Amino acids were identified in plasma using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and were further subjected to multiple logistic regression analysis. The score plots of principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) showed clear discrimination of CHD patients with AD, acute AD or chronic AD patients, respectively. The contents of histidine, glycine, serine, citrate, ornithine, hydroxyproline, proline and sarcosine were significant different in acute AD patients comparing with CHD patients. The levels of citrate, GABA, glutamate and cysteine were significant different in chronic AD patients comparing with CHD patients. The contents of glutamate and phenylalanine were significant changed in acute AD patients comparing with chronic AD patients. Plasma aminograms were significantly altered in patients with AD comparing with CHD, especially in acute AD, suggesting amino acid profile is expected to exploit a novel, non-invasive, objective diagnosis for AD.

Wearable Sensing and Telehealth Technology with Potential Applications in the Coronavirus Pandemic

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a pandemic with serious clinical manifestations including death. A pandemic at the large-scale like COVID-19 places extraordinary demands on the world's health systems, dramatically devastates vulnerable populations, and critically threatens the global communities in an unprecedented way. While tremendous efforts at the frontline are placed on detecting the virus, providing treatments and developing vaccines, it is also critically important to examine the technologies and systems for tackling disease emergence, arresting its spread and especially the strategy for diseases prevention. The objective of this article is to review enabling technologies and systems with various application scenarios for handling the COVID-19 crisis. The article will focus specifically on 1) wearable devices suitable for monitoring the populations at risk and those in quarantine, both for evaluating the health status of caregivers and management personnel, and for facilitating triage processes for admission to hospitals; 2) unobtrusive sensing systems for detecting the disease and for monitoring patients with relatively mild symptoms whose clinical situation could suddenly worsen in improvised hospitals; and 3) telehealth technologies for the remote monitoring and diagnosis of COVID-19 and related diseases. Finally, further challenges and opportunities for future directions of development are highlighted.

Recovery from the Middle East respiratory syndrome is associated with antibody and T-cell responses.

The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a highly lethal pneumonia. MERS was recently identified as a candidate for vaccine development, but most efforts focus on antibody responses, which are often transient after CoV infections. CoV-specific T cells are generally long-lived, but the virus-specific T cell response has not been addressed in MERS patients. We obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cells and/or sera from 21 MERS survivors. We detected MERS-CoV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in all MERS survivors and demonstrated functionality by measuring cytokine expression after peptide stimulation. Neutralizing (PRNT50) antibody titers measured in vitro predicted serum protective ability in infected mice and correlated with CD4+ but not CD8+ T cell responses; patients with higher PRNT50 and CD4+ T cell responses had longer intensive care unit stays and prolonged virus shedding and required ventilation. Survivors with undetectable MERS-CoV-specific antibody responses mounted CD8+ T cell responses comparable with those of the whole cohort. There were no correlations between age, disease severity, comorbidities, and virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses. In conclusion, measurements of MERS-CoV-specific T cell responses may be useful for predicting prognosis, monitoring vaccine efficacy, and identifying MERS patients with mild disease in epidemiological studies and will complement virus-specific antibody measurements.

Silibinin and SARS-CoV-2: Dual Targeting of Host Cytokine Storm and Virus Replication Machinery for Clinical Management of COVID-19 Patients.

COVID-19, the illness caused by infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is a rapidly spreading global pandemic in urgent need of effective treatments. Here we present a comprehensive examination of the host- and virus-targeted functions of the flavonolignan silibinin, a potential drug candidate against COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2. As a direct inhibitor of STAT3-a master checkpoint regulator of inflammatory cytokine signaling and immune response-silibinin might be expected to phenotypically integrate the mechanisms of action of IL-6-targeted monoclonal antibodies and pan-JAK1/2 inhibitors to limit the cytokine storm and T-cell lymphopenia in the clinical setting of severe COVID-19. As a computationally predicted, remdesivir-like inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)-the central component of the replication/transcription machinery of SARS-CoV-2-silibinin is expected to reduce viral load and impede delayed interferon responses. The dual ability of silibinin to target both the host cytokine storm and the virus replication machinery provides a strong rationale for the clinical testing of silibinin against the COVID-19 global public health emergency. A randomized, open-label, phase II multicentric clinical trial (SIL-COVID19) will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of silibinin in the prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome in moderate-to-severe COVID-19-positive onco-hematological patients at the Catalan Institute of Oncology in Catalonia, Spain.

Altered Jejunal Permeability to Macromolecules During Viral Enteritis in the Piglet

We studied the macromolecular permeability of segments of jejunum from 2-wk-old piglets after the animals had been experimentally infected with an invasive enteric virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Jejunal segments were mounted in Ussing chambers at stages of the infection, and permeability was measured using three probe molecules of differing molecular weights. In control tissue, permeability to horseradish peroxidase was 2.6 times higher across segments with Peyer's patches than across segments without Peyer's patches, whereas polyethylene glycol 4000 and mannitol permeabilities were the same in patch and nonpatch segments. Twelve hours after infection, when virus had invaded the mucosa causing a structural lesion, and before diarrhea had begun, horseradish peroxidase permeability increased in non-patch-containing segments to equal that across patch-containing tissue. At this early 12-h stage, polyethylene glycol 4000 and mannitol permeation were unchanged in patchcontaining segments compared with controls. Ninety-six hours after transmissible gastroenteritis infection, when diarrhea was severe, horseradish peroxidase permeability in patch-free segments had returned to normal and patch-containing tissue permeability was diminished below control levels. Increased macromolecular permeability appears to occur only in the very early invasive stage of this viral enteritis and only in patch-free segments. Any consideration of the immunologic relevance of these complex phenomena must take into account the specialized function of the Peyer's patch regions of the small intestine.

Influenza epidemiology among hospitalized children in Stockholm, Sweden 1998–2014

BACKGROUND: Influenza remains a common reason for the hospitalization of children. There is a need for long term studies that are also population based. We describe the epidemiology of severe influenza in a defined population 1998–2014. METHOD: Retrospective study of annually collected data of virologically confirmed influenza in hospitalized children 0–17 years living in the catchment area (230,000 children). We gathered information about comorbidity and complications from case records, and compared Influenza A, B and A(H1N1)pdm09 with respect to these factors. RESULTS: A total of 922 children with influenza were hospitalized. The mean rate remained unchanged at 22.5–24.2 per 100,000 children per year. There were two major outbreaks: influenza A(H3N2) in 2003–2004 and the A(H1N1) pandemic in 2009–2010. The proportion of children with influenza B increased from 8% during the first half of the study period to 28% during the second half. The highest admission rate was found in children <3 months of age, 169 per 100,000. Children with influenza B were older than those with influenza A. Comorbidity was found in 34%, complications in 41%, and 11% needed intensive care management. The mortality rate was 0.17/100,000 children. CONCLUSION: Influenza remains an important reason for the hospitalization of children, especially during the first years of life. The increasing proportion of influenza B may have to be considered when recommending influenza vaccines.

Effects of Corticosteroid Treatment for Non-Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Propensity Score-Based Analysis.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The effects of corticosteroid treatment on non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients are unknown. To determine the impacts of adjuvant corticosteroid administrated to patients with non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHOD A retrospective cohort study based on propensity score analysis was designed to explore the effects of corticosteroid on several clinical outcomes. RESULTS 132 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria and 35 pairs were generated according to propensity score matching. Compared to non-corticosteroid group, the CT score on day 7 was significantly higher in corticosteroid group (8.6 (IQR, 2.8-11.5) versus 12.0 (IQR, 5.0-19.3), P = 0.046). In corticosteroid group, more patients progressed to severe cases (11.4% versus 2.9%, P = 0.353), hospital stay (23.5 days (IQR, 19-29 d) versus 20.2 days (IQR, 14-25.3 d), P = 0.079) and duration of viral shedding (20.3 days (IQR, 15.2-24.8 d) versus 19.4 days (IQR, 11.5-28.3 d), P = 0.669) were prolonged, while fever time (9.5 days (IQR, 6.5-12.2 d) versus 10.2 days (IQR, 6.8-14 d), P = 0.28) was shortened, however all these data revealed no statistically significant differences. CONCLUSION Corticosteroid might have a negative effect on lung injury recovery in non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients, however the results of this study must be interpreted with caution because of confounding factors.

Some Cell Culture Procedures in Diagnostic Medical Virology

This chapter discusses the cell culture procedures as an invaluable tool in diagnostic medical virology. Culture of cells in monolayers is the most common method used in diagnostic virology laboratories. Primary or secondary cultures cells retain their diploid chromosome number, a factor which makes them particularly susceptible to certain viruses. The ideal cell system for a diagnostic virology laboratory would be a continuous line which retained its diploid chromosome number. It would be impossible in a routine laboratory to inoculate each specimen into every type of cell culture. A routine procedure is therefore employed and the specimen is inoculated into three types of cells which will support the growth of as many viruses as possible. Mixed culture technique (cocultivation) has proved of value when a viral agent is difficult to isolate from the original tissue, for example, isolation of measles from a brain biopsy. Cultures of chopped tissues have been used for many years to support the growth of viruses but the techniques were not readily applicable to diagnostic virology. A simple method of cultivating fragments of ciliated epithelium was described, which resulted in the isolation of new rhinoviruses and a new member of the corona virus group.

Laparoscopic excision of a choledochal cyst in 82 consecutive patients.

INTRODUCTION Despite it being a benign disease, a choledochal cyst must be removed with the gallbladder (GB) due to the risk of cancer in the biliary tract. Most patients are young females or children, all of whom express strong interest in the cosmetic results in addition to the complete resolution of their medical problems. Here, we introduce a laparoscopic management technique for a choledochal cyst. METHODS Between 2003 and 2011, we performed a laparoscopic choledochal cyst excision procedure on 82 patients using a four-hole method. There were three open-conversion cases, one case involving robotic surgery, and one case involving combined laparoscopic liver resection because the cyst had affected the liver. Excision of the cyst and anastomosis were performed laparoscopically. We will present our method with a video. RESULTS The mean operation time was 230 min. The estimated blood loss was 197 ml. The average hospital stay was 8.6 days. The most common complications were minor bile leakage (7 %) and fluid collection (2.5 %), both of which were managed conservatively. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic management can be a treatment of choice for the most instances of choledochal cyst considering its good cosmetic results and its feasible level of operative safety.

Effect of intra-abdominal pressure on hepatic microcirculation: implications of the endothelin-1 receptor.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of endothelin receptor A (ET(A)) and endothelin receptor B (ET(B)) blockade on liver microcirculation and oxygenation during intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) increase. METHODS Fifteen anesthetized pigs were randomized to receive either nonselective endothelin-1 (ET-1) blocker tezosentan (TG, n = 7) or saline (CG, n = 8). Helium was insufflated to increase IAP from 0 to 25 mmHg. Stroke volume variability was maintained ≤ 12% with colloid infusion. Total liver blood flow (TLBF), hepatic microcirculatory blood flow (MBF), hepatic tissue oxygenation (HpO(2)), hyaluronic acid and plasma disappearance rate (PDR) of indocyanine green (ICG) were recorded. RESULTS TLBF remained mostly unaltered in both groups at low IAP and decreased only in CG at the IAP of 25 mmHg. As IAP increased, a significant decline in MBF was observed without correlation with cardiac output or TLBF. In CG, HpO(2) decreased as early as IAP of 10 mmHg to high levels of pressure. However, in TG the decrease was significant only at the IAP of 25 mmHg. PDR of ICG decreased in both groups at IAP of 25 mmHg (P = 0.046 and P = 0.009 in TG and CG, respectively). These changes correlated with MBF (r = 0.793). CONCLUSION Blocking ET(A) and ET(B) receptors partially protects sinusoidal circulation and tissue oxygenation against stress induced by high IAP.

Cerebral oxygen saturation and peripheral perfusion in the extremely premature infant with intraventricular and/or pulmonary haemorrhage early in life.

Extremely preterm infants are at higher risk of pulmonary (PH) and intraventricular (IVH) haemorrhage during the transitioning physiology due to immature cardiovascular system. Monitoring of haemodynamics can detect early abnormal circulation that may lead to these complications. We described time-frequency relationships between near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) cerebral regional haemoglobin oxygen saturation (CrSO2) and preductal peripheral perfusion index (PI), capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) in extremely preterm infants in the first 72 h of life. Patients were sub-grouped in infants with PH and/or IVH (N H = 8) and healthy controls (N C = 11). Data were decomposed in wavelets allowing the analysis of localized variations of power. This approach allowed to quantify the percentage of time of significant cross-correlation, semblance, gain (transfer function) and coherence between signals. Ultra-low frequencies (<0.28 mHz) were analyzed as slow and prolonged periods of impaired circulation are considered more detrimental than transient fluctuations. Cross-correlation between CrSO2 and oximetry (PI, SpO2 and HR) as well as in-phase semblance and gain between CrSO2 and HR were significantly lower while anti-phase semblance between CrSO2 and HR was significantly higher in PH-IVH infants compared to controls. These differences may reflect haemodynamic instability associated with cerebrovascular autoregulation and hemorrhagic complications observed during the transitioning physiology.

Th22 cells are efficiently recruited in the gut by CCL28 as an alternative to CCL20 but do not compensate for the loss of Th17 cells in treated HIV-1-infected individuals.

Gut CD4+ T cells are incompletely restored in most HIV-1-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy, notably Th17 cells, a key subset in mucosal homeostasis. By contrast, gut Th22 cells are usually restored at normal frequencies. Th22 cells display a CCR6+CCR10+ phenotype and could thus respond to CCL20- and CCL28-mediated chemotaxis, while Th17 cells, which express CCR6 but not CCR10, depend on CCL20. Herein, we found that CCL28 is normally expressed by duodenal enterocytes of treated HIV-1-infected individuals, while CCL20 expression is blunted. Ex vivo, we showed that Th22 cells contribute to the reduction of CCL20 production by enterocytes through an IL-22- and IL-18-dependent mechanism. Th22 cells preferentially migrate via CCL20- rather than CCL28-mediated chemotaxis when both chemokines are available in the microenvironment. However, when the CCL20/CCL28 ratio drops, as in treated HIV-1-infected individuals, Th22 cells can migrate via the CCR10-CCL28 axis, as an alternative to CCR6-CCL20. This could explain the better reconstitution of gut Th22 compared with Th17 cells on antiretroviral therapy. Lastly, we assessed the relationships between the frequencies of gut Th17 and Th22 cells and inflammatory markers related to microbial translocation, and showed that Th22 cells do not compensate for the loss of Th17 cells in treated HIV-1-infected individuals.

A crucial role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in SARS coronavirus–induced lung injury

During several months of 2003, a newly identified illness termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread rapidly through the world(1,2,3). A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the SARS pathogen(4,5,6,7), which triggered severe pneumonia and acute, often lethal, lung failure(8). Moreover, among infected individuals influenza such as the Spanish flu(9,10) and the emergence of new respiratory disease viruses(11,12) have caused high lethality resulting from acute lung failure(13). In cell lines, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a potential SARS-CoV receptor(14). The high lethality of SARS-CoV infections, its enormous economic and social impact, fears of renewed outbreaks as well as the potential misuse of such viruses as biologic weapons make it paramount to understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV. Here we provide the first genetic proof that ACE2 is a crucial SARS-CoV receptor in vivo. SARS-CoV infections and the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV reduce ACE2 expression. Notably, injection of SARS-CoV Spike into mice worsens acute lung failure in vivo that can be attenuated by blocking the renin-angiotensin pathway. These results provide a molecular explanation why SARS-CoV infections cause severe and often lethal lung failure and suggest a rational therapy for SARS and possibly other respiratory disease viruses.

Diagnosis and Management of Tuberculous Pericarditis: What Is New?

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review provides an update on the immunopathogenesis of tuberculous pericarditis (TBP), investigations to confirm tuberculous etiology, the limitations of anti-tuberculous therapy (ATT), and recent efficacy trials. RECENT FINDINGS: A profibrotic immune response characterizes TBP, with low levels of AcSDKP, high levels of γ-interferon and IL-10 in the pericardium, and high levels of TGF-β and IL-10 in the blood. These findings may have implications for future therapeutic targets. Despite advances in nucleic acid amplification approaches, these tests remain disappointing for TBP. Trials of corticosteroids and colchicine have had mixed results, with no impact on mortality, evidence of a reduction in rates of constrictive pericarditis and potential harm in those with advanced HIV. Small studies suggest that ATT penetrates the pericardium poorly. Given that there is a close association between high bacillary burden and mortality, a rethink about the optimal drug doses and duration may be required. SUMMARY: The high mortality and morbidity from TBP despite use of anti-tuberculous drugs call for researches targeting host-directed immunological determinants of treatment outcome. There is also a need for the identification of steps in clinical management where interventions are needed to improve outcomes.

The COVID-19 Pandemic during the Time of the Diabetes Pandemic: Likely Fraternal Twins?

An altered immune response to pathogens has been suggested to explain increased susceptibility to infectious diseases in patients with diabetes. Recent evidence has documented several immunometabolic pathways in patients with diabetes directly related to the COVID-19 infection. This also seems to be the case for prediabetic subjects with proinflammatory insulin resistance syndrome accompanied with prothrombotic hyperinsulinemic and dysglycemic states. Patients with frank hyperglycemia, dysglycemia and/or hyperinsulinemia develop systemic immunometabolic inflammation with higher levels of circulating cytokines. This deleterious scenario has been proposed as the underlying mechanism enhancing a cytokine storm-like hyperinflammatory state in diabetics infected with severe COVID-19 triggering multi-organ failure. Compared with moderately affected COVID-19 patients, diabetes was found to be highly prevalent among severely affected patients suggesting that this non-communicable disease should be considered as a risk factor for adverse outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic mirrors with the diabetes pandemic in many pathobiological aspects. Our interest is to emphasize the ties between the immunoinflammatory mechanisms that underlie the morbidity and lethality when COVID-19 meets diabetes. This review brings attention to two pathologies of highly complex, multifactorial, developmental and environmentally dependent manifestations of critical importance to human survival. Extreme caution should be taken with diabetics with suspected symptoms of COVID-19 infection.

A CRISPR screen identifies IFI6 as an ER-resident interferon effector that blocks flavivirus replication

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an architecturally diverse organelle that serves as a membrane source for the replication of multiple viruses. Flaviviruses, including yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus and Zika virus, induce unique single-membrane ER invaginations that house the viral replication machinery1. Whether this virus-induced ER remodelling is vulnerable to antiviral pathways is unknown. Here, we show that flavivirus replication at the ER is targeted by the interferon (IFN) response. Through genome-scale CRISPR screening, we uncovered an antiviral mechanism mediated by a functional gene pairing between IFI6 (encoding IFN-α-inducible protein 6), an IFN-stimulated gene cloned over 30 years ago2, and HSPA5, which encodes the ER-resident heat shock protein 70 chaperone BiP. We reveal that IFI6 is an ER-localized integral membrane effector that is stabilized through interactions with BiP. Mechanistically, IFI6 prophylactically protects uninfected cells by preventing the formation of virus-induced ER membrane invaginations. Notably, IFI6 has little effect on other mammalian RNA viruses, including the related Flaviviridae family member hepatitis C virus, which replicates in double-membrane vesicles that protrude outwards from the ER. These findings support a model in which the IFN response is armed with a membrane-targeted effector that discriminately blocks the establishment of virus-specific ER microenvironments that are required for replication.

Correlates of HIV status among injection drug users in a border region of southern China and northern Vietnam.

This article presents an analysis of the correlates of HIV status among samples of injection drug users (IDUs) in Lang Son Province, Vietnam (n=348), and Ning Ming County, Guangxi Province, China (n=294), who were interviewed and tested for HIV antibody just before the start of a peer-based HIV prevention intervention in this border region. Participants were largely male, in their 20s, and single. Logistic regression analysis suggests that among Chinese IDUs, border-related factors (eg, living closer to the border, buying drugs across the border more frequently) and younger age are the best predictors of HIV positivity. In Vietnam, HIV status seems to drive behavior (eg, some risk reduction practices are predictive of HIV positivity). These differing patterns may reflect the fact that the intertwined epidemics of heroin injection and HIV began earlier and HIV prevalence has reached significantly higher levels in Lang Son than across the border in Ning Ming. Although border-related factors emerge as predictors in Ning Ming, more IDUs in Lang Son are HIV-positive and may be reacting behaviorally to that status. Their greater likelihood of engaging in risk reduction measures may reflect some combination of a belief that risk reduction can slow disease progression and an altruistic desire to avoid infecting others.

Single Chain Fragment Variable (scFv) Antibodies Targeting the Spike Protein of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Provide Protection against Viral Infection in Piglets

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious coronavirus that causes severe diarrhea and death in neonatal piglets. Passive immunization with neutralizing antibodies against PEDV is an effective prevention measure. In this study, single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies against PEDV were screened from the porcine scFv phage display library. After four rounds of biopanning, scFvs that showed higher affinity to the PEDV antigen were selected for further study. The scFv genes were cloned into the expression plasmid for recombinant protein expression. These scFvs were shown to inhibit PEDV infectivity by the plaque reduction neutralization assay. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) revealed that the epitopes recognized by these scFvs were in the S1 region of the spike protein. The potential of scFvs to provide prevention against PEDV infections in piglets was further investigated. Piglets orally administered scFvs showed no to mild clinical symptoms, significantly less viral shedding, no mortality and no intestinal lesions. The field application also revealed that the survival rate of piglets was significantly increased by oral administration of scFvs. Our data support the potential role of scFvs in the prevention and treatment of PEDV infection.

Targeting SARS-COV-2 non-structural protein 16: a virtual drug repurposing study

Non-Structural Protein 16 (nsp-16), a viral RNA methyltransferase (MTase), is one of the highly viable targets for drug discovery of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. In this study, drug discovery of SARS-CoV-2 nsp-16 has been performed by a virtual drug repurposing approach. First, drug shape-based screening (among FDA approved drugs) with a known template of MTase inhibitor, sinefungin was done and best compounds with high similarity scores were selected. In addition to the selected compounds, 4 nucleoside analogs of anti-viral (Raltgravir, Maraviroc and Favipiravir) and anti-inflammatory (Prednisolone) drugs were selected for further investigations. Then, binding energies and interaction modes were found by molecular docking approaches and compouds with lower energy were selected for further investigation. After that, Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried to test the potential selected compounds in a realistic environment. The results showed that Raltegravir and Maraviroc among other compounds can bind strongly to the active site of the protein compared to sinefungin, and can be potential candidates to inhibit NSP-16. Also, the MD simulation results suggested that the Maraviroc and Raltegravir are more effective drug candidates than Sinefungin for inhibiting the enzyme. It is concluded that Raltegravir and Maraviroc which may be used in the treatment of COVID-19 after Invitro and invivo studies and clinical trial for final confirmation of drug effectiveness.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Cyclosporin A and its analogs inhibit hepatitis B virus entry into cultured hepatocytes through targeting a membrane transporter, sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP)

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health problem worldwide. Although nucleos(t)ide analogs inhibiting viral reverse transcriptase are clinically available as anti-HBV agents, emergence of drug-resistant viruses highlights the need for new anti-HBV agents interfering with other targets. Here we report that cyclosporin A (CsA) can inhibit HBV entry into cultured hepatocytes. The anti-HBV effect of CsA was independent of binding to cyclophilin and calcineurin. Rather, blockade of HBV infection correlated with the ability to inhibit the transporter activity of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). We also found that HBV infection-susceptible cells, differentiated HepaRG cells and primary human hepatocytes expressed NTCP, while nonsusceptible cell lines did not. A series of compounds targeting NTCP could inhibit HBV infection. CsA inhibited the binding between NTCP and large envelope protein in vitro. Evaluation of CsA analogs identified a compound with higher anti-HBV potency, having a median inhibitory concentration <0.2 μM. Conclusion: This study provides a proof of concept for the novel strategy to identify anti-HBV agents by targeting the candidate HBV receptor, NTCP, using CsA as a structural platform.

Genome-wide screen identifies host genes affecting viral RNA recombination.

Rapid evolution of RNA viruses with mRNA-sense genomes is a major concern to health and economic welfare because of the devastating diseases these viruses inflict on humans, animals, and plants. To test whether host genes can affect the evolution of RNA viruses, we used a Saccharomyces cerevisiae single-gene deletion library, which includes approximately 80% of yeast genes, in RNA recombination studies based on a small viral replicon RNA derived from tomato bushy stunt virus. The genome-wide screen led to the identification of five host genes whose absence resulted in the rapid generation of new viral RNA recombinants. Thus, these genes normally suppress viral RNA recombination, but in their absence, hosts become viral recombination "hotbeds." Four of the five suppressor genes are likely involved in RNA degradation, suggesting that RNA degradation could play a role in viral RNA recombination. In contrast, deletion of four other host genes inhibited virus recombination, indicating that these genes normally accelerate the RNA recombination process. A comparison of deletion strains with the lowest and the highest recombination rate revealed that host genes could affect recombinant accumulation by up to 80-fold. Overall, our results demonstrate that a set of host genes have a major effect on RNA virus recombination and evolution.

Antigen-presenting properties of gingival fibroblasts in chronic adult periodontitis.

Chronic periodontitis is characterized by dense infiltrations of T lymphocytes in the connective tissue, which consists mainly of gingival fibroblasts. It is becoming increasingly clear that T lymphocytes and gingival fibroblasts are capable of influencing each other. For example, the T cell cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is able to induce MHC class II molecules on the surface of several cell types, including gingival fibroblasts. Histological sections of chronically inflamed gingival tissue showed a great number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that produced IFN-gamma, and in addition showed abundant expression of MHC class II molecules on gingival fibroblasts. Therefore, we investigated whether these gingival fibroblasts acquire the capacity to carry out MHC class II-restricted functions such as antigen presentation to local T cells. In this study, we show that IFN-gamma-treated gingival fibroblasts were able to function as antigen-presenting cells (APC) for superantigen-mediated T cell proliferation. However, these fibroblasts failed to present whole-cell antigens of periodontitis-associated bacteria. Moreover, gingival fibroblasts inhibited the presentation of the whole-cell antigens of these bacteria by professional APC. This inhibition could be overcome by the addition of IL-2. These results suggest that gingival fibroblasts play an important role in the local specific immune response in chronic inflammatory periodontal lesions by regulating the response of infiltrating T cells.

Targeted Delivery of Anti-coxsackievirus siRNAs Using Ligand-conjugated Packaging RNAs

Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a common pathogen of myocarditis. We previously synthesized a siRNA targeting the CVB3 protease 2A (siRNA/2A) gene and achieved reduction of CVB3 replication by 92% in vitro. However, like other drugs under development, CVB3 siRNA faces a major challenge of targeted delivery. In this study, we investigated a novel approach to deliver CVB3 siRNAs to a specific cell population (e.g. HeLa cells containing folate receptor) using receptor ligand (folate)-linked packaging RNA (pRNA) from bacterial phage phi29. pRNA monomers can spontaneously form dimers and multimers under optimal conditions by base-pairing between their stem loops. By covalently linking a fluorescence-tag to folate, we delivered the conjugate specifically to HeLa cells without the need of transfection. We further demonstrated that pRNA covalently conjugated to siRNA/2A achieved an equivalent antiviral effect to that of the siRNA/2A alone. Finally, the drug targeted delivery was further evaluated by using pRNA monomers or dimers, which carried both the siRNA/2A and folate ligand and demonstrated that both of them strongly inhibited CVB3 replication. These data indicate that pRNA as a siRNA carrier can specifically deliver the drug to target cells via its ligand and specific receptor interaction and inhibit virus replication effectively.

Magnetic resonance imaging in children with sickle cell disease--detecting alterations in the apparent diffusion coefficient in hips with avascular necrosis.

BACKGROUND Avascular necrosis (AVN) is a common morbidity in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) that leads to pain and joint immobility. However, the diagnosis is often uncertain or delayed. OBJECTIVE To examine the ability of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements on diffusion-weighted imaging to detect AVN in children with SCD. MATERIALS AND METHODS ADC values were calculated at the hips of normal children (n = 19) and children with SCD who were either asymptomatic with no known previous hip disease (n = 13) or presented for the first time with clinical symptoms of hip pathology (n = 12). ADC values were compared for differences among groups with and without AVN using non-parametric statistical methods. RESULTS The ADC values were elevated in the hips of children with AVN (median ADC = 1.57 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s [95% confidence interval = 0.86-2.10]) and differed significantly in pairwise comparisons (all P < 0.05) from normal children (0.74 [0.46-0.98]), asymptomatic children with SCD (0.55 [0.25-0.85]), and SCD children who had symptoms referable to their hips but did not show findings of hip AVN on conventional MRI or radiographs (0.46 [0.18-0.72]). CONCLUSION Children with sickle cell disease have elevated apparent diffusion coefficient values in their affected hips on initial diagnosis of avascular necrosis.

Ecology of zoonoses: natural and unnatural histories

Summary More than 60% of human infectious diseases are caused by pathogens shared with wild or domestic animals. Zoonotic disease organisms include those that are endemic in human populations or enzootic in animal populations with frequent cross-species transmission to people. Some of these diseases have only emerged recently. Together, these organisms are responsible for a substantial burden of disease, with endemic and enzootic zoonoses causing about a billion cases of illness in people and millions of deaths every year. Emerging zoonoses are a growing threat to global health and have caused hundreds of billions of US dollars of economic damage in the past 20 years. We aimed to review how zoonotic diseases result from natural pathogen ecology, and how other circumstances, such as animal production, extraction of natural resources, and antimicrobial application change the dynamics of disease exposure to human beings. In view of present anthropogenic trends, a more effective approach to zoonotic disease prevention and control will require a broad view of medicine that emphasises evidence-based decision making and integrates ecological and evolutionary principles of animal, human, and environmental factors. This broad view is essential for the successful development of policies and practices that reduce probability of future zoonotic emergence, targeted surveillance and strategic prevention, and engagement of partners outside the medical community to help improve health outcomes and reduce disease threats.

A health-based assessment of particulate air pollution in urban areas of Beijing in 2000–2004

Abstract Particulate air pollution is a serious problem in Beijing. The annual concentration of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (PM10), ranging from 141 to 166 μg m−3 in 2000–2004, could be very harmful to human health. In this paper, we presented the mortality and morbidity effects of PM10 pollution based on statistical data and the epidemiological exposure–response function. The economic costs to health during the 5 years were estimated to lie between US$1670 and $3655 million annually, accounting for about 6.55% of Beijing's gross domestic product each year. The total costs were apportioned into two parts caused by: the local emissions and long-range transported pollution. The contribution from local emissions dominated the total costs, accounting on average for 3.60% of GDP. However, the contributions from transported pollution cannot be neglected, and the relative percentage to the total costs from the other regions could account for about 45%. An energy policy and effective measures should be proposed to reduce particulate matter, especially PM2.5 pollution in Beijing to protect public health. The Beijing government also needs to cooperate with the other local governments to reduce high background level of particulate air pollution.

COVID-19, an opportunity to reevaluate the correlation between long-term effects of anthropogenic pollutants on viral epidemic/pandemic events and prevalence

Occupational, residential, dietary and environmental exposures to mixtures of synthetic anthropogenic chemicals after World War II have a strong relationship with the increase of chronic diseases, health cost and environmental pollution. The link between environment and immunity is particularly intriguing as it is known that chemicals and drugs can cause immunotoxicity (e.g., allergies and autoimmune diseases). In this review, we emphasize the relationship between long-term exposure to xenobiotic mixtures and immune deficiency inherent to chronic diseases and epidemics/pandemics. We also address the immunotoxicologic risk of vulnerable groups, taking into account biochemical and biophysical properties of SARS-CoV-2 and its immunopathological implications. We particularly underline the common mechanisms by which xenobiotics and SARS-CoV-2 act at the cellular and molecular level. We discuss how long-term exposure to thousand chemicals in mixtures, mostly fossil fuel derivatives, exposure toparticle matters, metals, ultraviolet (UV)–B radiation, ionizing radiation and lifestyle contribute to immunodeficiency observed in the contemporary pandemic, such as COVID-19, and thus threaten global public health, human prosperity and achievements, and global economy. Finally, we propose metrics which are needed to address the diverse health effects of anthropogenic COVID-19 crisis at present and those required to prevent similar future pandemics.

Viral loads in throat and anal swabs in children infected with SARS-CoV-2

Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay on anal swabs was recently reported to be persistently positive even after throat testing was negative during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, data about the consistent performance of RT-PCR assay on throat and anal swabs remain limited in paediatric patients. Here, we retrospectively reviewed RT-PCR-testing results of 212 paediatric patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at Wuhan Children's Hospital. The diagnostic potential of these two types of specimens showed significant difference (positive rate: 78.2% on throat swabs vs. 52.6% on anal swabs, McNemar Test P = 0.0091) and exhibited a weak positive consistency (Kappa value was 0.311, P < 0.0001) in paediatric patients. Furthermore, viral loads detected on both throat and anal swabs also showed no significant difference (P = 0.9511) and correlation (Pearson r = 0.0434, P = 0.8406), and exhibited an inconsistent kinetic change through the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Besides, viral loads in the throat and anal swabs were correlated with different types of immune states, immune-reactive phase, and the resolution phase/immunologic tolerance, respectively. These findings revealed that RT-PCR-testing on throat and anal swabs showed significant difference for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 infection and correlated with different immune state in paediatric patients.

A case series describing the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in Jilin Province

Since its outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province China, 2019-coronavirus infected disease (COVID-19) had been widely spread all over the world, the control of which calls for a better understanding of its epidemiology and clinical characteristics. We included 12 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in First Affiliated Hospital of Jilin University from 23 January 2020 to 11 February 2020, which were retrospectively analyzed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features. All the patients were confirmed by nucleic acid detection, the average age of whom was 45.25 years (range, 23–79 years). Most patients had a history of Wuhan traveling or had contact with Wuhan travelers or infected cases. Obvious family cluster was observed. Clinical manifestations included fever (12/12), fatigue (10/12), cough (6/12), sore throat (4/12), headache (3/12), and diarrhea (2/12). Only three out of eight patients had pneumonia manifestation on radiography. Most patients had a normal white blood cell (WBC) count and normal or reduced lymphocyte (LY) count. Pneumonia changes were observed in all the four patients who underwent a chest CT scan. Only one elderly patient developed severe pneumonia, while all the rest were mild disease and had a self-limiting course.

Bat Airway Epithelial Cells: A Novel Tool for the Study of Zoonotic Viruses

Bats have been increasingly recognized as reservoir of important zoonotic viruses. However, until now many attempts to isolate bat-borne viruses in cell culture have been unsuccessful. Further, experimental studies on reservoir host species have been limited by the difficulty of rearing these species. The epithelium of the respiratory tract plays a central role during airborne transmission, as it is the first tissue encountered by viral particles. Although several cell lines from bats were established recently, no well-characterized, selectively cultured airway epithelial cells were available so far. Here, primary cells and immortalized cell lines from bats of the two important suborders Yangochiroptera and Yinpterochiroptera, Carollia perspicillata (Seba's short-tailed bat) and Eidolon helvum (Straw-colored fruit bat), were successfully cultured under standardized conditions from both fresh and frozen organ specimens by cell outgrowth of organ explants and by the use of serum-free primary cell culture medium. Cells were immortalized to generate permanent cell lines. Cells were characterized for their epithelial properties such as expression of cytokeratin and tight junctions proteins and permissiveness for viral infection with Rift-Valley fever virus and vesicular stomatitis virus Indiana. These cells can serve as suitable models for the study of bat-borne viruses and complement cell culture models for virus infection in human airway epithelial cells.

TEMPORARY REMOVAL: Two small, cysteine-rich and cationic antifungal proteins from Penicillium chrysogenum: A comparative study of PAF and PAFB

The filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum Q176 secretes the antimicrobial proteins (AMPs) PAF and PAFB, which share a compact disulfide-bond mediated, β-fold structure rendering them highly stable. These two AMPs effectively inhibit the growth of human pathogenic fungi in micromolar concentrations and exhibit antiviral potential without causing cytotoxic effects on mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo. The antifungal mechanism of action of both AMPs is closely linked to - but not solely dependent on - the lipid composition of the fungal cell membrane and requires a strictly regulated protein uptake into the cell, indicating that PAF and PAFB are not canonical membrane active proteins. Variations in their antifungal spectrum and their killing dynamics point towards a divergent mode of action related to their physicochemical properties and surface charge distribution. In this review, we relate characteristic features of PAF and PAFB to the current knowledge about other AMPs of different sources. In addition, we present original data that have never been published before to substantiate our assumptions and provide evidences that help to explain and understand better the mechanistic function of PAF and PAFB. Finally, we underline the promising potential of PAF and PAFB as future antifungal therapeutics.

Hydrodynamic comparison of the Penumbra system and commonly available syringes in forced-suction thrombectomy.

BACKGROUND The Penumbra system uses a coaxial separator and continuous extracorporeal suction to remove a clot from a cerebral artery. Forced-suction thrombectomy (FST) involves aspirating clots through the same reperfusion catheter using only a syringe, decreasing the procedure time and supplies needed. OBJECTIVE To evaluate multiple combinations of catheters and syringes to determine the optimal pairing for use in FST. METHODS Tests were performed using both the Penumbra system and syringes to aspirate water through Penumbra 0.041 inch (041), 4Max, 0.054 inch (054) and 5Max reperfusion catheters and a shuttle sheath. Dynamic pressure and flow at the catheter tip were calculated from the fill times for each system. Static pressure and force for each aspiration source were determined with a vacuum gauge. RESULTS All syringes provided significantly higher dynamic pressure at the catheter tip than the Penumbra system (p<0.001). Increasing syringe volume significantly increased static pressure (p<0.001). Both flow and aspiration force significantly increased with catheter size (p<0.001). Cases are presented to demonstrate the clinical value of the laboratory principles. CONCLUSIONS Maximizing static and dynamic pressure when performing FST is achieved by aspirating with a syringe possessing both the largest volume and the largest inlet diameter available. Maximizing aspiration force and flow rate is achieved by using the largest catheter possible.

Temperature of gas delivered from ventilators.

BACKGROUND Although heated humidifiers (HHs) are the most efficient humidifying device for mechanical ventilation, some HHs do not provide sufficient humidification when the inlet temperature to the water chamber is high. Because portable and home-care ventilators use turbines, blowers, pistons, or compressors to inhale in ambient air, they may have higher gas temperature than ventilators with piping systems. We carried out a bench study to investigate the temperature of gas delivered from portable and home-care ventilators, including the effects of distance from ventilator outlet, fraction of inspiratory oxygen (FIO2), and minute volume (MV). METHODS We evaluated five ventilators equipped with turbine, blower, piston, or compressor system. Ambient air temperature was adjusted to 24°C ± 0.5°C, and ventilation was set at FIO2 0.21, 0.6, and 1.0, at MV 5 and 10 L/min. We analyzed gas temperature at 0, 40, 80, and 120 cm from ventilator outlet and altered ventilator settings. RESULTS While temperature varied according to ventilators, the outlet gas temperature of ventilators became stable after, at the most, 5 h. Gas temperature was 34.3°C ± 3.9°C at the ventilator outlet, 29.5°C ± 2.2°C after 40 cm, 25.4°C ± 1.2°C after 80 cm and 25.1°C ± 1.2°C after 120 cm (P < 0.01). FIO2 and MV did not affect gas temperature. CONCLUSION Gas delivered from portable and home-care ventilator was not too hot to induce heated humidifier malfunctioning. Gas soon declined when passing through the limb.

A Real-Time Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction for Differentiation of Massachusetts Vaccine and Brazilian Field Genotypes of Avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus.

The avian infectious bronchitis virus is classified into serotypes or genotypes (or both) in different poultry-producing countries of the world. In Brazil, Massachusetts type (Mass), used as a live vaccine, and local field Brazilian variants (genotypes; BR) predominate in the commercial poultry flocks. This study describes the development and validation of two real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR) for the specific detection of Mass and BR genotypes in allantoic fluids and clinical samples. Genotype-specific primers, combined with a generic probe targeted to the S1 gene, originated Mass RT-qPCR and BR RT-qPCR-specific assays. Analytical sensitivity and linearity of these assays were determined in comparison with an IBV generic real-time RT-PCR based on the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR RT-qPCR). Mass RT-qPCR detected five Mass field isolates, three vaccine samples, and one coinfected sample (BR and Mass) while BR RT-qPCR detected 16 BR field isolates. Both assays were linear (R(2) > 0.98), reproducible, and as sensitive as the classical 5'UTR RT-qPCR used to detect IBV. In the analysis of 141 IBV clinical samples, 8 were positive for Mass RT-qPCR, 76 for BR RT-qPCR, and 2 for both assays. In the remaining 55 samples, 25 were positive only for 5'UTR RT-qPCR and 30 were negative for the three assays. In conclusion, both assays were able to detect Mass and BR genotypes, allowing rapid and easy IBV molecular typing from allantoic fluids and clinical samples.

Mismanagement of Covid-19: lessons learned from Italy

Maria Laura Ruiu is lecturer at Northumbria University (Newcastle upon Tyne). She has recently completed her second PhD in Social Sciences (Northumbria University). She also acted as post-doctoral researcher at the Desertification Research Centre (University of Sassari, Italy) investigating the adaptive capacity of some communities to climate change impact. This paper analyses the first phases of the Covid-19 (Coronavirus) outbreak management in Italy by exploring the combination of political, scientific, media and public responses. A lack of coordination between political and scientific levels, and between institutional claim-makers and the media, suggests a mismanagement of the crisis during the first phases of the outbreak. The outbreak management suffered from the five communication weaknesses identified by Reynolds, related to i) mixed messages from multiple messengers; ii) delay in releasing information; iii) paternalistic attitudes; iv) lack of immediate reaction to rumours; and v) political confusion. This supports that the communication of uncertainty around an unknown threat should be accompanied by both political and scientific cohesion. However, both political and scientific dysfunctions caused the failure of several government efforts to contain the outbreak. This paper contributes towards informing policymakers on some lessons learned from the management of the Covid-19 in one of the most affected countries in the world. The Italian case study offers the opportunity for other countries to improve the management of the outbreak by limiting the spread of both chaos and panic.

Orts- und zeitflexibles Arbeiten: Alte Geschlechterungleichheiten und neue Muster der Arbeitsteilung durch Digitalisierung

This paper follows the question to what extent the compatibility of work and family life and gender inequalities in the domestic division of labour change when working with digital technologies in a flexible manner in terms of time and place. It is based on the results of the research project “Changing gender relations through digital transformation” (Hans Böckler Foundation). Various effects have been observed: For example, mobile working and home office enable part-time workers to increase their contractual working hours; flexible digital work provides emotional and time relief in the event of spontaneous emergencies such as child illness; however, the extent of invisible and unpaid overtime is also increasing. In most cases, this does not lead to a reorganisation or redistribution of unpaid domestic and care work. Nevertheless, there are signs of shifts in the domestic division of labour. This article presents the central results of the project and discusses them with regard to their implications for gender inequality. Practical Relevance: The text provides information on current experiences with flexible working times and places from a gender perspective. It provides indications of conducive and obstructive conditions for reducing inequalities in the responsibility for care work and in domestic division of labour. The results can be used for the design of conditions and regulations for flexible work in terms of time and place in companies.

Epidemiological Trends of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China

Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic broke out in Wuhan, China, and it spread rapidly. Since January 23, 2020, China has launched a series of unusual and strict measures, including the lockdown of Wuhan city to contain this highly contagious disease. We collected the epidemiological data to analyze the trend of this epidemic in China. Methods: We closely tracked the Chinese and global official websites to collect the epidemiological information about COVID-19. The number of total and daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China was presented to illustrate the trend of this epidemic. Results: On January 23, 2020, 835 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in China. On February 6, 2020, there were 31,211 cases. By February 20, 2020, the number reached as high as 75,993. Most cases were distributed in and around Wuhan, Hubei province. Since January 23, 2020, the number of daily new cases in China except Hubei province reached a peak of 890 on the eleventh day and then it declined to a low level of 34 within two full-length incubation periods (28 days), and the number of daily new cases in Hubei also started to decrease on the twelfth day, from 3,156 on February 4, 2020 to 955 on February 15, 2020. Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic has been primarily contained in China. The battle against this epidemic in China has provided valuable experiences for the rest of the world. Strict measures need to be taken as earlier as possible to prevent its spread.

Pathogenicity of glycoprotein C negative mutants of herpes simplex virus type 1 for the mouse central nervous system

Abstract A previous study from our laboratory showed that a mutant of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), strain KOS-321, carrying a deletion in the structural gene for glycoprotein C (gC) had reduced pathogenicity for the mouse central nervous system when compared to the wild-type virus (Kümel et al., 1985). In this study, eight additional gC negative (gC−) mutants derived from KOS-321 were shown to vary widely in their ability to induce lethal encephalitis in female DBA/2 mice following intracerebral inoculation. This variation in virulence showed no correlation with thymidine kinase activity. One less virulent gC− strain, gC−39, was further studied to determine whether the neurovirulent phenotype could be restored by rescue of the gC gene using standard marker rescue cotransfection procedures. The resulting progeny contained 2% gC+ recombinant virions and was tested for its ability to cause encephalitis. Although this progeny had increased virulence, it was not attributable to the acquisition of the gC gene since passive immunization of mice with a pool of anti-gC monoclonal antibodies had no effect on the development of encephalitis and only gC−viruses were isolated from diseased brain tissues. In agreement with these findings, individual plaque-purified gC positive (gC+) virus recombinants were shown not to have been restored to the wild-type virus level of neurovirulence. It is concluded that gC is not a virulence determinant in this mouse model of HSV-induced encephalitis and that cotransfection procedures can induce additional mutations that affect viral pathogenesis.

The murine coronavirus nucleocapsid gene is a determinant of virulence.

The murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59, causes acute encephalitis and chronic demyelinating disease as well as hepatitis in mice. The JHM strain (also called MHV-4 or JHM.SD) causes fatal encephalitis and only minimal hepatitis. Previous analysis of chimeric recombinant MHVs in which the spike gene, encoding the protein that mediates viral entry and cell-to-cell fusion, was exchanged between JHM and A59 showed that the spike plays a major role in determining organ tropism and neurovirulence but that other genes also play important roles in pathogenic outcome. Here, we have investigated the role of the nucleocapsid protein in MHV-induced disease. The multifunctional nucleocapsid protein is complexed with the genomic RNA, interacts with the viral membrane protein during virion assembly, and plays an import role in enhancing the efficiency of transcription. A pair of chimeric recombinant viruses in which the nucleocapsid gene was exchanged between JHM and A59 was selected and compared to wild-type parental strains in terms of virulence. Importantly, expression of the JHM nucleocapsid in the context of the A59 genome conferred increased mortality and spread of viral antigen in the mouse central nervous system compared to the parental A59 strain, while having little effect on the induction of hepatitis. While the JHM nucleocapsid did not appear to enhance neuron-to-neuron spread in primary neuronal cultures, the increased neurovirulence it conferred may be due in part to the induction of a less robust T-cell response than that induced by strain A59.

Expression Pattern Analysis of Antiviral Genes and Inflammatory Cytokines in PEDV-Infected Porcine Intestinal Epithelial Cells

Porcine diarrhea disease in newborn and suckling piglets due to infection with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a leading cause of economic loss in the pig industry globally. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the host innate immune response to PEDV infection. The expression dynamics of antiviral genes (e.g., RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-α, IFN-β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12) in porcine small intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells were analyzed following PEDV stimulation. The results showed that the expression of antiviral genes (e.g., PKR, OAS1, and Mx2) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-α and TNF-α) were significantly reduced within 0–4 h post-infection (P < 0.05). However, all antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines were up-regulated from 12 to 24 h (P < 0.05), and cytopathic changes were observed during this time. The expression of RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2 were significantly and positively correlated to each other during the entire infection (P < 0.01). The results suggested that the RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2 genes may play an important role in PEDV infection in piglets. Initially, PEDV displayed cellular invasion by inhibiting IFN-α transcription and interfering with the antiviral function of PKR, OAS1, and Mx2, ultimately induced an intense inflammatory response. The relationship between antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines with PEDV infection at the cellular level provides a reference for studying the mechanism of resistance to PEDV infection in piglets.

Laparoscopic gastric pouch and remnant resection: a novel approach to refractory anastomotic ulcers after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: case report.

BACKGROUND Anastomotic or marginal ulcers occur in 0.6 to 16% of patients after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y-Gastric Bypass. Initial therapy aims at eliminating known risk factors including smoking, Helicobacter pylori infection, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and inhibition of gastric acid secretion. While this approach is successful in 68 to 88% of the cases, up to one third of patients need a subsequent surgical revision. However, marginal ulcers still recur in up to 10% of cases after revisional surgery, thus constituting a serious challenge for bariatric surgeons. CASE PRESENTATION We herein report a case of an insidious marginal ulcer refractory to both medical therapy with high-dosed proton pump inhibitors and sucralfate as well as surgical therapy consisting of the lengthening of a short alimentary limb and later resection of the gastroenterostomy and construction of a new tension-free anastomosis. Only after gastrectomy by laparoscopic en-bloc resection of the gastrojejunostomy, the gastric pouch and resection of the gastric remnant with reconstruction by esophagojejunostomy the patient remained free of symptoms. CONCLUSION By laparoscopic resection of the entire gastric pouch and the gastric remnant the risk to leave a suboptimally vascularised or even ischemic pouch in situ was avoided. The esophagojejunostomy was then created in healthy, good vascularised tissue. In our case this novel approach was effective in the management of a refractory anastomotic ulcer and might represent a rescue option when simple revision of the gastrojejunostomy fails.

Treatment of the common cold with unrefined echinacea. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

BACKGROUND Echinacea preparations are widely used to treat the common cold. OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of dried, encapsulated, whole-plant echinacea as early treatment for the common cold. DESIGN Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled community-based trial. SETTING University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin. PARTICIPANTS 148 registered students with common colds of recent onset. INTERVENTION An encapsulated mixture of unrefined Echinacea purpurea herb (25%) and root (25%) and E. angustifolia root (50%) taken in 1-g doses six times on the first day of illness and three times on each subsequent day of illness for a maximum of 10 days. MEASUREMENTS Severity and duration of self-reported symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. RESULTS No statistically significant differences were detected between the echinacea and placebo groups for any of the measured outcomes. Trajectories of severity over time were nearly identical in the two groups. Mean cold duration was 6.01 days in both groups as a whole, 5.75 days in the placebo group, and 6.27 days in the echinacea group (between-group difference, -0.52 day [95% CI, -1.09 to 0.22 days]). After controlling for severity and duration of symptoms before study entry, sex, date of enrollment, and use of nonprotocol medications, researchers found no statistically significant treatment effect (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.24 [CI, 0.86 to 1.78]). Multivariable regression models assessing severity scores over time failed to detect statistically significant differences between the echinacea and placebo groups. CONCLUSION Compared with placebo, unrefined echinacea provided no detectable benefit or harm in these college students who had the common cold.

Chitosan-cellulose composite for wound dressing material. Part 2. Antimicrobial activity, blood absorption ability, and biocompatibility.

Chitosan (CS), a polysaccharide derived from chitin, the second most abundant polysaccharide, is widely used in the medical world because of its natural and nontoxic properties and its innate ability for antibacterial and hemostasis effects. In this study, the novel composites containing CS and cellulose (CEL) (i.e., [CEL + CS]), which we have previously synthesized using a green and totally recyclable method, were investigated for their antimicrobial activity, absorption of anticoagulated whole blood, anti-inflammatory activity through the reduction of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the biocompatibility with human fibroblasts. The [CEL + CS] composites were found to inhibit the growth of both Gram positive and negative micro-organisms. For examples, the regenerated 100% lyophilized chitosan material was found to reduce growth of Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739 and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 51299) by 78, 36, and 64%, respectively. The composites are nontoxic to fibroblasts; that is, fibroblasts, which are critical to the formation of connective tissue matrix were found to grow and proliferate in the presence of the composites. They effectively absorb blood, and at the same rate and volume as commercially available wound dressings. The composites, in both air-dried and lyophilized forms, significantly inhibit the production of TNF-α and IL-6 by stimulated macrophages. These results clearly indicate that the biodegradable, biocompatible and nontoxic [CEL + CS] composites, particularly those dried by lyophilizing, can be effectively used as a material in wound dressings.

The efficacy and risks of preoperative embolization of spinal tumors.

BACKGROUND The goal of preoperative embolization of spinal tumors is to improve surgical outcomes by diminishing the vascular supply to the tumor to reduce intraoperative blood loss and operative time. OBJECTIVE To report our institutional experience with spinal tumor embolization and review the present literature. METHODS Clinical records from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2012 were reviewed and analyzed. Angiograms were used to calculate the percentage reduction in tumor vascularity, and relevant clinical and operative data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Thirty-seven patients underwent preoperative spinal tumor embolization (24 metastatic and 13 primary lesions) and were included in the study. One complication resulted in transient lower extremity weakness and was attributed to post-embolization swelling, which fully resolved after surgical resection. The transient neurological complication rate was 1/37 (3%) and the permanent rate was 0/37 (0%). The average surgical estimated blood loss (EBL) was 1946 mL (100-7000 mL) and the average operative time was 330 min (range 164-841 min). After embolization, tumor blush was reduced by 83% on average. Average pre- and postoperative modified Rankin Scale scores were 2.10 and 1.36, respectively (p=0.03). Cases in which tumor blush was decreased by ≥90% (classes 1 or 2) after embolization had significantly less operative blood loss than those cases in which <90% (classes 3 or 4) was achieved (mean EBL 1391 vs 2296 mL, respectively, p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS Spinal tumor embolization is a safe procedure, is associated with few complications, and may improve surgical outcomes by limiting intraoperative blood loss and reducing operative time.

Cis-acting sequences may contribute to size variation in the surface glycoprotein of bovine immunodeficiency virus.

Genetic recombination is an important mechanism of retrovirus variation and diversity. Size variation in the surface (SU) glycoprotein, characterized by duplication and insertion, has been observed during in vivo infection with several lentiviruses, including bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1. These duplication/insertion events are thought to occur through a mechanism of template switching/strand transfer during reverse transcription. Studies of RNA recombination in a number of virus systems indicate that cis-acting sequences can modulate the frequency of template switching/strand transfer. The size variable region of EIAV and BIV SU glycoproteins was examined and an AU-rich region and regions of nucleotide sequence identity that may facilitate template switching/strand transfer were identified. An in vitro strand transfer assay using donor and acceptor templates derived from the size variable region in BIV env detected both precise and imprecise strand transfer products, in addition to full-length products. Sequence analysis of clones obtained from imprecise strand transfer products showed that 87.5% had crossover sites within 10 nt of the crossover site observed in vivo. Mutations in the donor template which altered either the AU-rich region or nucleotide sequence identity dramatically decreased the frequency of imprecise strand transfer. Together, these results suggest that cis-acting elements can modulate non-homologous recombination events during reverse transcription and may contribute to the genetic and biological diversity of lentiviruses in vivo.

IFN-α2a or IFN-β1a in combination with ribavirin to treat Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus pneumonia: a retrospective study

OBJECTIVES: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is associated with significant mortality. We examined the utility of plasma MERS-CoV PCR as a prognostic indicator and compared the efficacies of IFN-α2a and IFN-β1a when combined with ribavirin in reducing MERS-CoV-related mortality rates. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 32 patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection, admitted between April 2014 and June 2014, by positive respiratory sample RT–PCR. Plasma MERS-CoV RT–PCR was performed at the time of diagnosis for 19 patients. RESULTS: The overall mortality rate was 69% (22/32). Ninety percent (9/10) of patients with positive plasma MERS-CoV PCR died compared with 44% (4/9) of those with negative plasma MERS-CoV PCR. Mortality rate in patients who received IFN-α2a was 85% (11/13) compared with 64% (7/11) in those who received IFN-β1a (P = 0.24). The mortality rate in patients with renal failure (14), including 8 on haemodialysis, was 100%. Age >50 years and diabetes mellitus were found to be significantly associated with mortality (OR = 26.1; 95% CI 3.58–190.76; P = 0.001 and OR = 15.74; 95% CI 2.46–100.67; P = 0.004, respectively). The median duration of viral shedding in patients who recovered was 11 days (range 6–38 days). Absence of fever was noted in 5/32 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma MERS-CoV RT–PCR may serve as an effective tool to predict MERS-CoV-associated mortality. Older age and comorbid conditions may have contributed to the lack of efficacy of IFN-α2a or IFN-β1a with ribavirin in treating MERS-CoV. Absence of fever should not exclude MERS-CoV.

ABSTRACT Objective The purpose of this report is to describe actions by chiropractic entities during the early stages of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods Large entities that support chiropractic education or practice were invited to participate in this report. Leaders of various entities were emailed an invitation. A designee who was assigned by the leader provided a brief synopsis of actions the entity had taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Only entities that responded are included in this report. Results Five entities agreed to participate: The Council on Chiropractic Education, Association of Chiropractic Colleges, Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards, National Board of Chiropractic Examiners, and the NCMIC. Common themes included (1) recognizing the crisis and taking action; (2) establishing a safe working environment for staff so that services could continue; (3) delivering communications to stakeholders (chiropractic students, practitioners, licensing boards, and others) to guide decisions and direct actions; and (4) continuing to monitor the situation and respond as new information becomes available. Conclusion These entities serve a large portion of the chiropractic profession. They have been quick to respond in a responsible, compassionate, and supportive manner to assist chiropractic licensing boards, practitioners, and students during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings are encouraging as the chiropractic profession looks to the future as it navigates changes in education and the healthcare environment in the months and years ahead.

The short-term outcomes of robotic sphincter-preserving surgery for rectal cancer: comparison with open and laparoscopic surgery using a propensity score analysis.

PURPOSE The aim of this study is to clarify the short-term outcomes of robotic sphincter-preserving surgery for rectal cancer in a retrospective study. METHODS The short-term outcomes of robotic sphincter-preserving surgery (n = 130) were retrospectively compared to open (n = 234) and laparoscopic surgery (n = 318) by a propensity score analysis. RESULTS Robotic surgery was performed more frequently for patients with lower rectal cancer (55%) than open (30%, p < 0.0001) or laparoscopic surgery (36%, p < 0.0001). None of the robotic surgery cases were converted to open surgery. After propensity score matching, robotic surgery was found to be associated with a longer operation time (342 vs. 230 min, p < 0.0001) and less blood loss (7 vs. 420 mL, p < 0.0001) than open surgery. The overall complication rate of robotic surgery was lower than that of open surgery (13 vs. 28%, p = 0.032). Robotic surgery was associated with a lower incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) than laparoscopic surgery (0 vs. 7%, p = 0.028). There were no cases of anastomotic leakage after robotic surgery. The circumferential resection margin was involved in 0.8% of the patients who underwent robotic surgery; the incidence did not differ among the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS Although robotic surgery for rectal cancer was associated with a longer operation time, it was associated with a very low incidence of SSIs. The degree of safety was comparable to both open and laparoscopic surgery.

Rhinovirus is an important pathogen in upper and lower respiratory tract infections in Mexican children

BACKGROUND: Most of the studies characterizing the incidence of rhinovirus (RV) have been carried out in hospitalized children and in developed countries. In those studies, RV-C has been associated with more severe respiratory tract infections than RV species A and B. In this study we determined the frequency and diversity of RV strains associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URTI, LRTI) in Mexico, and describe the clinical characteristics of the illness associated with different RV species. METHODS: A prospective surveillance of 526 and 250 children with URTI and LRTI was carried out. Respiratory samples were analyzed by RT-PCR for viruses. The 5′ untranslated region of the RV genome was amplified and sequenced. RESULTS: In the case of URTI, 17.5% were positive for RV, while this virus was found in 24.8% of LRTI. The RV species was determined in 73 children with URTI: 61.6% were RV-A, 37% RV-C and, 1.4% RV-B; and in 43 children with LRTI: 51.2% were RV-A, 41.8% RV-C, and 7% RV-B. No significant differences in clinical characteristics were found in patients with RV-A or RV-C infections. A high genetic diversity of RV strains was found in both URTI and LRTI. CONCLUSIONS: Both RV-A and RV-C species were frequently found in hospitalized as well as in outpatient children. This study underlines the high prevalence and genetic diversity of RV strains in Mexico and the potential severity of disease associated with RV-A and RV-C infections.

Ganglioside-linked terminal sialic acid moieties on murine macrophages function as attachment receptors for murine noroviruses.

Noroviruses are the major cause of nonbacterial gastroenteritis in humans. However, little is known regarding the norovirus life cycle, including cell binding and entry. In contrast to human noroviruses, the recently discovered murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1) readily infects murine macrophages and dendritic cells in culture. Many viruses, including the related feline calicivirus, use terminal sialic acids (SA) as receptors for infection. Therefore, we tested whether SA moieties play a role during MNV-1 infection of murine macrophages. Competition with SA-binding lectins and neuraminidase treatment led to a reduction in MNV-1 binding and infection in cultured and primary murine macrophages, suggesting a role for SA during the initial steps of the MNV-1 life cycle. Because SA moieties can be attached to glycolipids (i.e., gangliosides), we next determined whether MNV-1 uses gangliosides during infection. The gangliosides GD1a, GM1, and asialo-GM1 (GA1) are natural components of murine macrophages. MNV-1 bound to ganglioside GD1a, which is characterized by an SA on the terminal galactose, but not to GM1 or asialo-GM1 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The depletion of gangliosides using an inhibitor of glycosylceramide synthase (d-threo-P4) led to a reduction of MNV-1 binding and infection in cultured and primary murine macrophages. This defect was specifically rescued by the addition of GD1a. A similar phenotype was observed for MNV field strains WU11 (GV/WU11/2005/USA) and S99 (GV/Berlin/2006/DE). In conclusion, our data indicate that MNV can use terminal SA on gangliosides as attachment receptors during binding to murine macrophages.

Intensive care risk estimation in COVID-19 pneumonia based on clinical and imaging parameters: experiences from the Munich cohort

Background: The rapidly evolving dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the steadily increasing infection numbers require diagnostic tools to identify patients at high risk for a severe disease course. Here we evaluate clinical and imaging parameters for estimating the need of intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. Methods: We collected clinical, laboratory and imaging data from 65 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection based on PCR positivity. IL-6, CRP, leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were determined in blood samples. Two radiologists evaluated the severity of imaging findings in computed tomography (CT) images on a scale from 1 (no characteristic signs of COVID-19) to 5 (confluent ground glass opacities in over 50% of the lung parenchyma). The volume of affected lung was quantified using commercially available software. Machine learning modelling was performed to estimate the risk for intensive care unit treatment. Findings: Patients with a severe course of COVID-19 had significantly increased IL-6, CRP and leukocyte counts and significantly decreased lymphocyte counts. The radiological severity grading was significantly increased in ICU patients. Multivariate random forest modelling showed a mean +/- standard deviation sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 0.72 +/- 0.1, 0.86 +/- 0.16 and 0.80 +/- 0.1 and a ROC-AUC of 0.79 +/- 0.1. The most important predictive parameters were affected lung volume, radiological severity score, CRP and IL-6. Summary and Conclusion: Estimation of need for intensive care treatment is possible based on the clinical and radiological parameters.

Current transcriptomics in pig immunity research

Swine performance in the face of disease challenge is becoming progressively more important. To improve the pig’s robustness and resilience against pathogens through selection, a better understanding of the genetic and epigenetic factors in the immune response is required. This review highlights results from the most recent transcriptome research, and the meta-analyses performed, in the context of pig immunity. A technological overview is given including wholegenome microarrays, immune-specific arrays, small-scale high-throughput expression methods, high-density tiling arrays, and next generation sequencing (NGS). Although whole genome microarray techniques will remain complementary to NGS for some time in domestic species, research will transition to sequencing-based methods due to cost-effectiveness and the extra information that such methods provide. Furthermore, upcoming high-throughput epigenomic studies, which will add greatly to our knowledge concerning the impact of epigenetic modifications on pig immune response, are listed in this review. With emphasis on the insights obtained from transcriptomic analyses for porcine immunity, we also discuss the experimental design in pig immunity research and the value of the newly published porcine genome assembly in using the pig as a model for human immune response. We conclude by discussing the importance of establishing community standards to maximize the possibility of integrative computational analyses, such as was clearly beneficial for the human ENCODE project. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00335-014-9549-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Genetic factors associated with response to as-needed aflibercept therapy for typical neovascular age-related macular degeneration and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy

In the present study, we investigated the association between susceptible genetic variants to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and response to as-needed intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI) therapy for exudative AMD including both typical neovascular AMD and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) over 12-months. A total of 234 patients with exudative AMD were initially treated with 3 monthly IAI and thereafter as-needed IAI over 12 months. Seven variants of 6 genes including ARMS2 A69S (rs10490924), CFH (I62V:rs800292 and rs1329428), C2-CFB-SKIV2L(rs429608), C3 (rs2241394), CETP (rs3764261) and ADAMTS-9 (rs6795735) were genotyped for all participants using TaqMan technology. After adjusting for age, gender, baseline BCVA and AMD subtype, A (protective) allele of C2-CFB-SKIV2L rs429608 was associated with visual improvement at 12-month (P = 0.003). Retreatment was associated with T(risk) allele of ARMS2 A69S (P = 2.0 × 10-4; hazard ratio: 2.18:95%CI: 1.47-3.24) and C(risk) allele of CFH rs1329428 (P = 2.0 × 10-3; hazard ratio: 1.74:95%CI: 1.16-2.59) after adjusting for the baseline confounders. The need for additional injections was also associated with T allele of ARMS2 A69S (P = 1.0 × 10-5) and C allele of CFH rs1329428 (P = 3.0 × 10-3) after adjusting for the baseline confounders. The variants of ARMS2 and CFH are informative for both physicians and patients to predict recurrence and to quantify the need for additional injections.

Impact of severe hematological abnormalities in the outcome of hospitalized patients with influenza virus infection

Although hematological abnormalities have been described among patients with influenza virus infection, little is known about their impact on the outcome of the patients. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and clinical impact of severe hematological abnormalities in patients with confirmed influenza virus infection. This was an observational retrospective study including all adult patients with diagnosis of influenza virus infection hospitalized from January to May 2016 in our institution. Influenza virus infection was diagnosed by means of rRT-PCR assay performed on respiratory samples. Poor outcome was defined as a composite endpoint in which at least one of the following criteria had to be fulfilled: (a) respiratory failure, (b) SOFA ≥2, or (c) death. Two hundred thirty-nine patients were included. Applying the HLH-04 criteria for the diagnosis of hemophagocytic syndrome, cytopenias (hemoglobin ≤9 g/dl, platelets <100,000/μl or neutrophils <1,000/μl) were present in 51 patients (21%). Patients with hematological abnormalities showed higher SOFA scores, respiratory failure, septic shock and in-hospital mortality than the remaining patients. The composite endpoint was present in 33.3% in the cytopenias group vs. 13.3% in the group without cytopenias (p=0.001). In a multivariate analysis, variables associated with the composite endpoint were: use of steroids prior to present admission (OR: 0.12; 95% CI: 0.015–0.96, p=0.046), presence of any hematological abnormality (OR: 3.54; 95% CI:1.66–7.51, p= 0.001), and LDH>225 U/l (OR:4.45; CI:1–19.71, p=0.049). Hematological abnormalities are not uncommon among hospitalized patients with influenza virus infection, and they are associated with a poorer outcome.

Graphitic nitride-catalyzed advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for landfill leachate treatment: A mini review

Abstract Landfill leachate poses significant risks to public health via the release of high-toxicity contaminants, including refractory organic compounds, ammonia-nitrogen compounds, and heavy metals. Significant efforts have been made to develop useful methods for leachate disposition and treatment. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are one of the most promising methods, because they can rapidly degrade diverse pollutants and significantly improve the biodegradability of leachate. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a fascinating conjugated polymer, has become a hot topic in AOP research due to its metal-free benefits and high photosensitivity. Thus, combining AOPs with g-C3N4 achieves excellent degradation of refractory pollutants in leachate. Since the composition of leachate is complex in the practical conditions, the information reported by current studies of using g-C3N4 as a remediator is still incomplete and fragmented. Thus, in this review, the recent status of leachate treatment and approaches for its disposal has been summarized and some conclusions have been drawn. In addition, a brief introduction to g-C3N4 and its application in AOPs for leachate treatment have been critically discussed and with its future outlook assessed. Although the development of g-C3N4 in AOPs for leachate treatment is highly efficient and practical, comprehensive study about its application and technology expansion is urgently needed, based on the complex operating conditions. Perspectives on the treatment of leachate using g-C3N4-AOPs are also included. The information and perspectives provided in this review will provide guidance and novel understanding to accelerate the development of g-C3N4-based AOPs for leachate treatment.

Shared-Memory Parallel Probabilistic Graphical Modeling Optimization: Comparison of Threads, OpenMP, and Data-Parallel Primitives

This work examines performance characteristics of multiple shared-memory implementations of a probabilistic graphical modeling (PGM) optimization code, which forms the basis for an advanced, state-of-the art image segmentation method. The work is motivated by the need to accelerate scientific image analysis pipelines in use by experimental science, such as at x-ray light sources, and is motivated by the need for platform-portable codes that perform well across many different computational architectures. The primary focus of this work and its main contribution is an in-depth study of shared-memory parallel performance of different implementations, which include those using alternative parallelization approaches such as C11-threads, OpenMP, and data parallel primitives (DPPs). Our results show that, for this complex data-intensive algorithm, the DPP implementation exhibits better runtime performance, but also exhibits less favorable scaling characteristics than the C11-threads and OpenMP counterparts. Based upon a set of experiments that collect hardware performance counters on multiple platforms, the reason for the runtime performance difference appears to be due primarily to algorithmic efficiency gains: the reformulation from the traditional C11-threads and OpenMP expression of the solution into that of data parallel primitives results in significantly fewer instructions being executed. This study is the first of its type to do performance analysis using hardware counters for comparing methods based on VTK-m-based data-parallel primitives with those based on more traditional OpenMP or threads-based parallelism. It is timely, as there is increasing awareness of the need for platform portability in light of increasing node-level parallelism and increasing device heterogeneity.

Molecular diversity of Alphacoronavirus 1 in dogs and cats in Colombia

Alphacoronavirus 1 (subgenus Tegacovirus, genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae), which encompasses transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), feline coronavirus (FCoV) and canine coronavirus (CCoV), is an important pathogen that can cause severe gastroenteritis and is distributed worldwide. CCoV has two different genotypes: CCoV type I, which has a high identity with FCoV-I, and CCoV type II, which is divided into two subtypes, CCoV IIa (pantropic) and CCoV IIb, which is related to FCoV-II and has been involved in multiple recombination events. Between 2014 and 2018, 43 fecal samples from puppies and young dogs under 1 year of age with hemorrhagic enteritis and from 5 cats under 2 years of age with ascites or thoracic effusion were collected by a private veterinary practice in Bogotá, Colombia. A screening for Coronavirus via RT-PCR (nsp12) and PCR amplification of Canine protoparvovirus (VP1) revealed 27.1% (13/49) and 72.9% (35/49) positive samples, respectively. Positive samples for coronavirus were tested for M, N, S and the sequences grouped in the FCoV, CCoV-I and CCoV-IIb clusters that were distant from the pantropic type (IIa). The N gene formed two clusters, one exclusively with samples from this study in subtype II and another with strains in subtype I. For gene S (subtype I), the samples clustered with the Brazilian samples, while samples positive for S subtype IIb grouped into a cluster distinct from the other reference sequences. The prevalence of coronaviruses identified in this study is within the range reported by different countries worldwide.

Respiratory Viruses in Adults With Community-Acquired Pneumonia

Background Use of nucleic acid amplification techniques has increased the identification of respiratory viruses (RVs) in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The objectives of the present study were to identify RV in patients with CAP using three different sampling methods and to compare CAP virus proportions and types with two comparison groups. Methods The study population included 183 adult patients with CAP, 450 control subjects, and 201 patients with nonpneumonic lower respiratory tract infection (NPLRTI). Each participant was sampled by oropharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, and nasopharyngeal washing, and the samples were tested for detection of 12 RVs by multiplex TaqMan Hydrolysis probe-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (Integrated DNA Technology; Coralville, IA). Results At least one RV was identified in 58 patients with CAP (31.7%) compared with 32 (7.1%) in control subjects and 104 (51.7%) in patients with NPLRTI (P < .01 and P < .01, respectively). Coronaviruses were identified in 24 (13.1%) patients with CAP, compared with 17 (3.8%) in control subjects, and 21 (10.4%) patients with NPLRTI. Respiratory syncytial virus was identified in 13 (7.1%), four (0.9%), and seven (3.5%); rhinovirus in nine (4.9%), nine (2.0%), and 15 (7.5%); and influenza virus in eight (4.4%), two (0.4%), and 63 (31.3%) patients with CAP, control subjects, and patients with NPLRTI, respectively. Conclusions The proportion of RV involvement in CAP is higher than previously reported. The proportion of RV identified in healthy subjects is significantly lower than in CAP, but it is not zero and should be weighed when interpreting corresponding proportions among patients.

Evaluating the virucidal efficacy of hydrogen peroxide vapour

Summary Background Surface contamination has been implicated in the transmission of certain viruses, and surface disinfection can be an effective measure to interrupt the spread of these agents. Aim To evaluate the in-vitro efficacy of hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV), a vapour-phase disinfection method, for the inactivation of a number of structurally distinct viruses of importance in the healthcare, veterinary and public sectors. The viruses studied were: feline calicivirus (FCV, a norovirus surrogate); human adenovirus type 1; transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus of pigs (TGEV, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] surrogate); avian influenza virus (AIV); and swine influenza virus (SwIV). Methods The viruses were dried on stainless steel discs in 20- or 40-μL aliquots and exposed to HPV produced by a Clarus L generator (Bioquell, Horsham, PA, USA) in a 0.2-m3 environmental chamber. Three vaporized volumes of hydrogen peroxide were tested in triplicate for each virus: 25, 27 and 33mL. Findings No viable viruses were identified after HPV exposure at any of the vaporized volumes tested. HPV was virucidal (>4-log reduction) against FCV, adenovirus, TGEV and AIV at the lowest vaporized volume tested (25mL). For SwIV, due to low virus titre on the control discs, >3.8-log reduction was shown for the 25-mL vaporized volume and >4-log reduction was shown for the 27-mL and 33-mL vaporized volumes. Conclusion HPV was virucidal for structurally distinct viruses dried on surfaces, suggesting that HPV can be considered for the disinfection of virus-contaminated surfaces.

Two-Dimensional Matter: Order, Curvature and Defects

Many systems in nature and the synthetic world involve ordered arrangements of units on two-dimensional surfaces. We review here the fundamental role payed by both the topology of the underlying surface and its detailed curvature. Topology dictates certain broad features of the defect structure of the ground state but curvature-driven energetics controls the detailed structured of ordered phases. Among the surprises are the appearance in the ground state of structures that would normally be thermal excitations and thus prohibited at zero temperature. Examples include excess dislocations in the form of grain boundary scars for spherical crystals above a minimal system size, dislocation unbinding for toroidal hexatics, interstitial fractionalization in spherical crystals and the appearance of well-separated disclinations for toroidal crystals. Much of the analysis leads to universal predictions that do not depend on the details of the microscopic interactions that lead to order in the first place. These predictions are subject to test by the many experimental soft and hard matter systems that lead to curved ordered structures such as colloidal particles self-assembling on droplets of one liquid in a second liquid. The defects themselves may be functionalized to create ligands with directional bonding. Thus nano to meso scale superatoms may be designed with specific valency for use in building supermolecules and novel bulk materials. Parameters such as particle number, geometrical aspect ratios and anisotropy of elastic moduli permit the tuning of the precise architecture of the superatoms and associated supermolecules. Thus the field has tremendous potential from both a fundamental and materials science/supramolecular chemistry viewpoint.

Management of Kawasaki disease

Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute self-limiting inflammatory disorder, associated with vasculitis, affecting predominantly medium-sized arteries, particularly the coronary arteries. In developed countries KD is the commonest cause of acquired heart disease in childhood. The aetiology of KD remains unknown, and it is currently believed that one or more as yet unidentified infectious agents induce an intense inflammatory host response in genetically susceptible individuals. Genetic studies have identified several susceptibility genes for KD and its sequelae in different ethnic populations, including FCGR2A, CD40, ITPKC, FAM167A-BLK and CASP3, as well as genes influencing response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aneurysm formation such as FCGR3B, and transforming growth factor (TGF) β pathway genes. IVIG and aspirin are effective therapeutically, but recent clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that the addition of corticosteroids to IVIG is beneficial for the prevention of coronary artery aneurysms (CAA) in severe cases with highest risk of IVIG resistance. Outside of Japan, however, clinical scores to predict IVIG resistance perform suboptimally. Furthermore, the evidence base does not provide clear guidance on which corticosteroid regimen is most effective. Other therapies, including anti-TNFα, could also have a role for IVIG-resistant KD. Irrespective of these caveats, it is clear that therapy that reduces inflammation in acute KD, improves outcome. This paper summarises recent advances in the understanding of KD pathogenesis and therapeutics, and provides an approach for managing KD patients in the UK in the light of these advances.

Weight Loss Outcomes of Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Band with Plication: a Single Center Experience of 66 Patients with 18-Month Follow-Up.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic adjustable gastric band with plication (LAGBP) is a novel bariatric procedure, which combines the adjustability of the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) with the restrictive nature of the vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). The addition of plication of the stomach to LAGB should provide better appetite control, more effective weight loss, and greater weight loss potential. The purpose of the study was to analyze the outcomes of LAGBP at 18 months. METHODS Data from all patients who underwent a primary LAGBP procedure from December 2011 through June 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Data collected from each patient included age, gender, weight, body mass index (BMI), and excess weight loss (EWL). RESULTS Sixty-six patients underwent LAGBP. The mean age and BMI were 44.6 ± 12.7 years and 42.1 ± 5.1 kg/m2, respectively. The patients lost an average of 49% and 46.8% EWL at 12 months (77.2% follow-up) and 18 months (66.1% follow-up), respectively. The mean band adjustments were 2.1 ± 1.7 (range, 0-7) per patient in 1 year. The mean additional adjustment volume (infusion and withdrawal of saline) was 0.6 ± 1 cc. Dysphagia was the most common long-term complication. The band removal rate was 7.5%. The mortality rate was 0%. CONCLUSIONS LAGBP is a relatively safe and effective bariatric procedure. In light of recent studies demonstrating poor outcomes following LAGB, LAGBP may prove to be the future for patients desiring a bariatric procedure without resection of the stomach.

Prophylactic and therapeutic intranasal administration with an immunomodulator, Hiltonol® (Poly IC:LC), in a lethal SARS-CoV-infected BALB/c mouse model

Abstract Hiltonol®, (Poly IC:LC), a potent immunomodulator, is a synthetic, double-stranded polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly IC) stabilized with Poly-L-lysine and carboxymethyl cellulose (LC). Hiltonol® was tested for efficacy in a lethal SARS-CoV-infected BALB/c mouse model. Hiltonol® at 5, 1, 0.5 or 0.25 mg/kg/day by intranasal (i.n.) route resulted in significant survival benefit when administered at selected times 24 h prior to challenge with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The infected BALB/c mice receiving the Hiltonol® treatments were also significantly effective in protecting mice against weight loss due to infection (p < 0.001). Groups of 20 mice were dosed with Hiltonol® at 2.5 or 0.75 mg/kg by intranasal instillation 7, 14, and 21 days before virus exposure and a second dose was given 24 h later, prophylactic Hiltonol® treatments (2.5 mg/kg/day) were completely protective in preventing death, and in causing significant reduction in lung hemorrhage scores, lung weights and lung virus titers. Hiltonol® was also effective as a therapeutic when give up to 8 h post virus exposure; 100% of the-infected mice were protected against death when Hiltonol® was administered at 5 mg/kg/day 8 h after infection. Our data suggest that Hiltonol® treatment of SARS-CoV infection in mice leads to substantial prophylactic and therapeutic effects and could be used for treatment of other virus disease such as those caused by MERS-CoV a related coronavirus. These properties might be therapeutically advantageous if Hiltonol® is considered for possible clinical use.

Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer treatment scheduling

Objective: Current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a heavy burden on the mental and physical health of patients, regional healthcare resources, and global economic activity. Many patients with lung cancer are thought to be affected by this situation. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer treatment scheduling. Study design: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of lung cancer patients who were undergoing anti-cancer treatment at the National Hospital Organization Kyoto Medical Center (600 beds) in Kyoto, Japan, between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020. Methods: After the medical records were reviewed, the patients were assigned to one of two groups, depending on whether their lung cancer treatment schedule was delayed. We assessed the characteristics, types of histopathology and treatment, and the reason for the delay. Results: A total 15 (9.1%) patients experienced the delay of lung cancer treatment during COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with treatment delay received significantly more ICIs monotherapy than patients without treatment delay (p=0.0057). On the contrary, no patients receiving molecular target agents experienced treatment delay during COVID-19 pandemic period (p=0.0027). The treatments of most of the patients were delayed per their request. Conclusion: We revealed 9.1% lung cancer patients suffered anxiety and requested treatment delay during COVID-19 pandemic. Oncologists should keep in mind that patient with cancer have more anxiety than we expected under special occasions such as COVID-19 pandemic.

Characterization of RNA in Saliva

Background: We have previously shown that human mRNAs are present in saliva and can be used as biomarkers of oral cancer. In this study, we analyzed the integrity, sources, and stability of salivary RNA. Methods: We measured the integrity of salivary RNA with reverse transcription followed by PCR (RT-PCR) or RT-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). To study RNA entry sites into the oral cavity, we used RT-PCR analysis of salivary RNA from the 3 major salivary glands, gingival crevice fluid, and desquamated oral epithelial cells. We measured stability of the salivary β-actin mRNA by RT-qPCR of salivary RNA incubated at room temperature for different periods of time. We measured RNA association with other macromolecules by filtering saliva through pores of different sizes before performing RT-qPCR. To assess RNA–macromolecule interaction, we incubated saliva with Triton X-100 for different periods of time before performing RT-qPCR. Results: In most cases, we detected partial- to full-length salivary mRNAs and smaller amounts of middle and 3′ gene amplicons compared with the 5′. RNA was present in all oral fluids examined. Endogenous salivary β-actin mRNA degraded more slowly than exogenous β-actin mRNA, with half-lives of 12.2 and 0.4 min, respectively (P <0.001). Salivary RNA could not pass through 0.22 or 0.45 μm pores. Incubation of saliva with Triton X-100 accelerated degradation of salivary RNA. Conclusions: Saliva harbors both full-length and partially degraded forms of mRNA. RNA enters the oral cavity from different sources, and association with macromolecules may protect salivary RNA from degradation.

High neutralizing antibody titer in intensive care unit patients with COVID-19

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a wide spectrum of disease severity from mild upper respiratory symptoms to respiratory failure. The role of neutralizing antibody (NAb) response in disease progression remains elusive. This study determined the seroprevalence of 733 non-COVID-19 individuals from April 2018 to February 2020 in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and compared the neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses of eight COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with those of 42 patients not admitted to the ICU. We found that NAb against SARS-CoV-2 was not detectable in any of the anonymous serum specimens from the 733 non-COVID-19 individuals. The peak serum geometric mean NAb titer was significantly higher among the eight ICU patients than the 42 non-ICU patients (7280 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1468-36099]) vs 671 [95% CI, 368-1223]). Furthermore, NAb titer increased significantly at earlier infection stages among ICU patients than among non-ICU patients. The median number of days to reach the peak Nab titers after symptoms onset was shorter among the ICU patients (17.6) than that of the non-ICU patients (20.1). Multivariate analysis showed that oxygen requirement and fever during admission were the only clinical factors independently associated with higher NAb titers. Our data suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was unlikely to have silently spread before the COVID-19 emergence in Hong Kong. ICU patients had an accelerated and augmented NAb response compared to non-ICU patients, which was associated with disease severity. Further studies are required to understand the relationship between high NAb response and disease severity.

Myocardial T1 mapping and extracellular volume quantification: a Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) and CMR Working Group of the European Society of Cardiology consensus statement.

Rapid innovations in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) now permit the routine acquisition of quantitative measures of myocardial and blood T1 which are key tissue characteristics. These capabilities introduce a new frontier in cardiology, enabling the practitioner/investigator to quantify biologically important myocardial properties that otherwise can be difficult to ascertain clinically. CMR may be able to track biologically important changes in the myocardium by: a) native T1 that reflects myocardial disease involving the myocyte and interstitium without use of gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCA), or b) the extracellular volume fraction (ECV)-a direct GBCA-based measurement of the size of the extracellular space, reflecting interstitial disease. The latter technique attempts to dichotomize the myocardium into its cellular and interstitial components with estimates expressed as volume fractions. This document provides recommendations for clinical and research T1 and ECV measurement, based on published evidence when available and expert consensus when not. We address site preparation, scan type, scan planning and acquisition, quality control, visualisation and analysis, technical development. We also address controversies in the field. While ECV and native T1 mapping appear destined to affect clinical decision making, they lack multi-centre application and face significant challenges, which demand a community-wide approach among stakeholders. At present, ECV and native T1 mapping appear sufficiently robust for many diseases; yet more research is required before a large-scale application for clinical decision-making can be recommended.

Bi-stability of SUDR+K model of epidemics and test kits applied to COVID-19

Motivated with various responses of world governments to COVID-19, here we develop a toy model of the dependence epidemics spreading on the availability of tests for disease. Our model, that we call SUDR+K, is based on usual SIR model, but it splits the total fraction of infected individuals into two components: those that are undetected and those that are detected through tests. Moreover, we assume that available tests increase at a constant rate from the beginning of epidemics but are consumed to detect infected individuals. Strikingly we find a bi-stable behavior between a phase with a giant fraction of infected and a phase with a very small fraction. We show that the separation between these two regimes is governed by a match between the rate of testing and a rate of infection spread at given time. We also show that the existence of two phases does not depend on the mathematical choice of the form of the term describing the rate at which undetected individuals are tested and detected. Presented research implies that a vigorous early testing activity, before the epidemics enters into its giant phase, can potentially keep epidemics under control, and that even a very small change in rate of testing can increase or decrease the size of the whole epidemics of various orders of magnitude. For the real application of realistic model to ongoing epidemics, we would gladly collaborate with field epidemiologists in order to develop quantitative models of testing process.

Establishing an emergency department syndromic surveillance system to support the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

BACKGROUND The London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games is a mass gathering event that will present a major public health challenge. The Health Protection Agency, in collaboration with the College of Emergency Medicine, has established the Emergency Department Sentinel Syndromic Surveillance System (EDSSS) to support the public health surveillance requirements of the Games. METHODS This feasibility study assesses the usefulness of EDSSS in monitoring indicators of disease in the community. Daily counts of anonymised attendance data from six emergency departments across England were analysed by patient demographics (age, gender, partial postcode), triage coding and diagnosis codes. Generic and specific syndromic indicators were developed using aggregations of diagnosis codes recorded during each attendance. RESULTS Over 339,000 attendances were recorded (26 July 2010 to 25 July 2011). The highest attendances recorded on weekdays between 10:00 and 11:00 and on weekends between 12:00 and 13:00. The mean daily attendance per emergency department was 257 (range 38-435). Syndromic indicators were developed including: respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiac, acute respiratory infection, gastroenteritis and myocardial ischaemia. Respiratory and acute respiratory infection indicators peaked during December 2010, concomitant with national influenza activity, as monitored through other influenza surveillance systems. CONCLUSIONS The EDSSS has been established to provide an enhanced surveillance system for the London 2012 Olympics. Further validation of the data will be required; however, the results from this initial descriptive study demonstrate the potential for identifying unusual and/or severe outbreaks of infectious disease, or other incidents with public health impact, within the community.

A scoping review of the use of Twitter for public health research

Public health practitioners and researchers have used traditional medical databases to study and understand public health for a long time. Recently, social media data, particularly Twitter, has seen some use for public health purposes. Every large technological development in history has had an impact on the behaviour of society. The advent of the internet and social media is no different. Social media creates public streams of communication, and scientists are starting to understand that such data can provide some level of access into the people's opinions and situations. As such, this paper aims to review and synthesize the literature on Twitter applications for public health, highlighting current research and products in practice. A scoping review methodology was employed and four leading health, computer science and cross-disciplinary databases were searched. A total of 755 articles were retreived, 92 of which met the criteria for review. From the reviewed literature, six domains for the application of Twitter to public health were identified: (i) Surveillance; (ii) Event Detection; (iii) Pharmacovigilance; (iv) Forecasting; (v) Disease Tracking; and (vi) Geographic Identification. From our review, we were able to obtain a clear picture of the use of Twitter for public health. We gained insights into interesting observations such as how the popularity of different domains changed with time, the diseases and conditions studied and the different approaches to understanding each disease, which algorithms and techniques were popular with each domain, and more.

Long-Term Outcomes After Open Repair for Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm

BACKGROUND: Early mortality in ruptured abdominal aneurysm (rAAA) is high, but data on long-term outcome are scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term outcome in survivors after open surgery for rAAA in well-defined population. METHODS: This is a population-based, observational long-term follow-up (beyond 30-day mortality) study of patients surgically treated for rAAA from 2000 through 2014. Long-term survival was analysed using Kaplan–Meier estimates and compared to the general population by analyses of relative survival. RESULTS: Out of 178 patients operated for rAAA, 95 patients (55%) either died in the perioperative period, were referred from other hospitals or were lost to follow-up (two patients). Altogether 83 patients were eligible for long-term outcomes: 72 men and 11 women. Estimated median crude survival time was 6.5 years [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.8–8.2]. Men had a median survival of 7.3 years (95% CI 5.1–9.4) versus 5.4 years in females (95% CI 3.5–7.3) (P = 0.082). Reinterventions during follow-up occurred in 31 (37%). Relative survival demonstrated a slightly higher risk of death in the rAAA population compared to the general age- and gender-matched population. Age, but not comorbidities, had a significant influence on long-term survival. CONCLUSION: For survivors beyond 30 days after surgery for rAAA, long-term survival compares well to that of an age- and sex-matched population. A high frequency of cardiovascular comorbidities did not seem to affect long-term survival.

Prediction and prevention of suicide in patients with unipolar depression and anxiety.

Epidemiological data suggest that between 59 and 87% of suicide victims suffered from major depression while up to 15% of these patients will eventually commit suicide. Male gender, previous suicide attempt(s), comorbid mental disorders, adverse life-situations, acute psycho-social stressors etc. also constitute robust risk factors. Anxiety and minor depression present with a low to moderate increase in suicide risk but anxiety-depression comorbidity increases this risk dramatically Contrary to the traditional psychoanalytic approach which considers suicide as a retrospective murder or an aggression turned in-wards, more recent studies suggest that the motivations to commit suicide may vary and are often too obscure. Neurobiological data suggest that low brain serotonin activity might play a key role along with the tryptophan hydroxylase gene. Social factors include social support networks, religion etc. It is proven that most suicide victims had asked for professional help just before committing suicide, however they were either not diagnosed (particularly males) or the treatment they received was inappropriate or inadequate. The conclusion is that promoting suicide prevention requires the improving of training and skills of both psychiatrists and many non-psychiatrists and especially GPs in recognizing and treating depression and anxiety. A shift of focus of attention is required in primary care to detect potentially suicidal patients presenting with psychological problems. The proper use of antidepressants, after a careful diagnostic evaluation, is important and recent studies suggest that successful acute and long-term antidepressant pharmacotherapy reduces suicide morbidity and mortality.

Epidemiological study of canine parvovirus infection in and around Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India

AIM: An epidemiological study of canine parvovirus infection in dogs in and around Bhubaneswar, Odisha was conducted between December 2012 to March 2013 and prevalence rate was studied on the basis of age, breed, and sex. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 71 fecal samples from suspected diarrheic dogs were collected in sterile phosphate buffer saline (10% W/V) and examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of canine parvo virus infection, followed by epidemiological study in relation to age, breed, and sex. RESULTS: Of 71 samples analyzed, 29 (40.85%) were found to be positive by PCR assay. The infection was higher in Deshi/local breeds (34.48%), followed by German shepherd (17.24%), equal incidences in mixed and Labrador retriever (10.34%), Rottweiler and German spitz showed 6.90% each and finally lower incidences in four breeds (3.45%) such as Dalmatians, Nea politan mastiff, Pug and Great Dane. Age-wise prevalence study revealed the infection being more in the age group of 3-6 months (41.37%), followed by equal incidences of 27.59% in 1-3 months and 6-12 months age group, and a low incidence in age groups above 12 months (3.45%). The incidence was predominantly higher in males (86.21%) than females (13.79%). CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological analysis revealed that the breed wise prevalence was found to be more in Deshi breeds as compared to others, age groups below 6 months were found to be more prone to parvovirus infection and males were mostly infected.

Repair of diaphragmatic hernia following spinal surgery by laparoscopic mesh application: a case report and review of the literature.

We describe the laparoscopic management of diaphragmatic hernia (DH) caused by vertebral pedicle screw displacement. A 58-year-old woman underwent surgery for scoliosis and underwent posterior pedicle screw fixation. In the first postoperative (PO)day, she developed mild dyspnea. An anteroposterior chest radiograph revealed bilateral pleural effusion, which was more pronounced on the left side. A thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, performed in the second PO day, revealed a solid mass in the pleural cavity that was associated with screw displacement, which had also entered into the peritoneal cavity without apparent other lesion of hollow and solid viscous. In the third PO day, after the screw was removed, explorative laparoscopy was carried out. We observed herniation of the omentum through a small diaphragmatic tear. Once the absence of visceral injury was confirmed, we reduced the omentum into the abdomen. Then, we repaired the hernia by applying a dual layer polypropylene mesh over the defect with a 3-cm overlap. The remainder of the postoperative period was uneventful. Iatrogenic DH due to a pedicle screw displacement has never been described before. In cases of pleural effusion following spinal surgery, rapid assessment and treatment are crucial. We conclude that a laparoscopic approach to iatrogenic DH could be feasible and effective in a hemodynamically stable patient with negative CT findings because it enables the completion of the diagnostic cascade and the repair of the tear, providing excellent visualization of the abdominal viscera and diaphragmatic tears.

Coronavirus Nsp10, a Critical Co-factor for Activation of Multiple Replicative Enzymes

The RNA-synthesizing machinery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is composed of 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1–16) encoded by ORF1a/1b. The 148-amino acid nsp10 subunit contains two zinc fingers and is known to interact with both nsp14 and nsp16, stimulating their respective 3′-5′ exoribonuclease and 2′-O-methyltransferase activities. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, in cellulo bioluminescence resonance energy transfer experiments, and in vitro pulldown assays, we have now identified the key residues on the nsp10 surface that interact with nsp14. The functional consequences of mutations introduced at these positions were first evaluated biochemically by monitoring nsp14 exoribonuclease activity. Disruption of the nsp10-nsp14 interaction abrogated the nsp10-driven activation of the nsp14 exoribonuclease. We further showed that the nsp10 surface interacting with nsp14 overlaps with the surface involved in the nsp10-mediated activation of nsp16 2′-O-methyltransferase activity, suggesting that nsp10 is a major regulator of SARS-CoV replicase function. In line with this notion, reverse genetics experiments supported an essential role of the nsp10 surface that interacts with nsp14 in SARS-CoV replication, as several mutations that abolished the interaction in vitro yielded a replication-negative viral phenotype. In contrast, mutants in which the nsp10-nsp16 interaction was disturbed proved to be crippled but viable. These experiments imply that the nsp10 surface that interacts with nsp14 and nsp16 and possibly other subunits of the viral replication complex may be a target for the development of antiviral compounds against pathogenic coronaviruses.

Putative vaccine breakthrough event associated with heterotypic rotavirus infection in newborn calves, Turkey, 2015

Abstract Group A rotaviruses (RVA) are regarded as major enteric pathogens of large ruminants, including cattle. Rotavirus vaccines administered to pregnant cows are commonly used to provide passive immunity that protects newborn calves from the clinical disease. In this study we report the detection of RVA from calves with severe diarrhea in a herd regularly vaccinated to prevent enteric infections including RVA. Diarrheic disease was observed in newborn calves aged 4–15days, with high morbidity and mortality rates, but no diarrhea was seen in adult animals. Rotavirus antigen was detected by enzyme-immunoassay in the intestinal content or the fecal samples of all examined animals. Besides RVA, bovine coronavirus and bovine enteric calicivirus were detected in some samples. Selected RVA strains were characterized by whole genome sequencing. Two strains, RVA/Cow-wt/TUR/Amasya-1/2015/G8P[5] and RVA/Cow-wt/TUR/Amasya-2/2015/G8P[5] were genotyped as G8-P[5]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T6-E2-H3 and showed >99% nucleotide sequence identity among themselves. This genomic constellation is fairly common among bovine RVA strains; however, phylogenetic analysis of the G8 VP7 gene showed close genetic relationship to some European human RVA strains (up to 98.4% nt identity). Our findings is the first indication regarding the circulation of G8 RVA strains in Turkey. Given that the administered RVA vaccines contained type G6 and G10 VP7 antigens some concerns raised with regard to the level of heterotypic protection elicited by the vaccine strains against circulating bovine G8 RVA strains. Enhancement of surveillance of circulating RVA strains in calves across Turkey is needed to support ongoing vaccination programs.

Evaluation of Mucosal and Systemic Immune Responses Elicited by GPI-0100- Adjuvanted Influenza Vaccine Delivered by Different Immunization Strategies

Vaccines for protection against respiratory infections should optimally induce a mucosal immune response in the respiratory tract in addition to a systemic immune response. However, current parenteral immunization modalities generally fail to induce mucosal immunity, while mucosal vaccine delivery often results in poor systemic immunity. In order to find an immunization strategy which satisfies the need for induction of both mucosal and systemic immunity, we compared local and systemic immune responses elicited by two mucosal immunizations, given either by the intranasal (IN) or the intrapulmonary (IPL) route, with responses elicited by a mucosal prime followed by a systemic boost immunization. The study was conducted in BALB/c mice and the vaccine formulation was an influenza subunit vaccine supplemented with GPI-0100, a saponin-derived adjuvant. While optimal mucosal antibody titers were obtained after two intrapulmonary vaccinations, optimal systemic antibody responses were achieved by intranasal prime followed by intramuscular boost. The latter strategy also resulted in the best T cell response, yet, it was ineffective in inducing nose or lung IgA. Successful induction of secretory IgA, IgG and T cell responses was only achieved with prime-boost strategies involving intrapulmonary immunization and was optimal when both immunizations were given via the intrapulmonary route. Our results underline that immunization via the lungs is particularly effective for priming as well as boosting of local and systemic immune responses.

Endoscopic endonasal resection of skull base chondrosarcomas: technique and early results.

OBJECT The authors of this study sought to report the technique and early clinical outcomes of a purely endonasal endoscopic approach for resection of petroclival chondrosarcomas. METHODS Between 2010 and 2014, 8 patients (4 men and 4 women) underwent endonasal endoscopic operations to resect petroclival chondrosarcomas at 2 institutions. The patients' mean age was 44.8 years (range 30-64 years). One of the patients had previously undergone radiation therapy and another a staged craniotomy. Using volumetric software, an independent neuroradiologist assessed the extent of the resections on MRI scans taken immediately after surgery and at the 3-month follow-up. Immediate complications and control of symptoms were also recorded. In addition, the authors reviewed the current literature on surgical treatment of chondrosarcoma. RESULTS The mean preoperative tumor diameter and volume were 3.4 cm and 9.8 cm(3), respectively. Six patients presented with cranial neuropathies. Endonasal endoscopic surgery achieved > 95% resection in 5 of the 8 patients and < 95% resection in the remaining 3 patients. One of the 6 neuropathies resolved, and the remaining 5 partially improved. One instance of postoperative CSF leakage required a reoperation for repair; no other complications associated with these operations were observed. All of the patients underwent adjuvant radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS According to the authors' experience, the endoscopic endonasal route is a safe and effective approach for the resection of appropriately selected petroclival chondrosarcomas.

Antiviral immunity is impaired in COPD patients with frequent exacerbations

Patients with frequent exacerbations represent a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subgroup requiring better treatment options. The aim of this study was to determine the innate immune mechanisms that underlie susceptibility to frequent exacerbations in COPD. We measured sputum expression of immune mediators and bacterial loads in samples from patients with COPD at stable state and during virus-associated exacerbations. In vitro immune responses to rhinovirus infection in differentiated primary bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) sampled from patients with COPD were additionally evaluated. Patients were stratified as frequent exacerbators (≥2 exacerbations in the preceding year) or infrequent exacerbators (<2 exacerbations in the preceding year) with comparisons made between these groups. Frequent exacerbators had reduced sputum cell mRNA expression of the antiviral immune mediators type I and III interferons and reduced interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression when clinically stable and during virus-associated exacerbation. A role for epithelial cell-intrinsic innate immune dysregulation was identified: induction of interferons and ISGs during in vitro rhinovirus (RV) infection was also impaired in differentiated BECs from frequent exacerbators. Frequent exacerbators additionally had increased sputum bacterial loads at 2 wk following virus-associated exacerbation onset. These data implicate deficient airway innate immunity involving epithelial cells in the increased propensity to exacerbations observed in some patients with COPD. Therapeutic approaches to boost innate antimicrobial immunity in the lung could be a viable strategy for prevention and treatment of frequent exacerbations.

The experience of the 2003 SARS outbreak as a traumatic stress among frontline healthcare workers in Toronto: lessons learned.

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the first half of 2003 in Canada was unprecedented in several respects. Understanding the psychological impact of the outbreak on healthcare workers, especially those in hospitals, is important in planning for future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. This review draws upon qualitative and quantitative studies of the SARS outbreak in Toronto to outline the factors that contributed to healthcare workers' experiencing the outbreak as a psychological trauma. Overall, it is estimated that a high degree of distress was experienced by 29-35% of hospital workers. Three categories of contributory factors were identified. Relevant contextual factors were being a nurse, having contact with SARS patients and having children. Contributing attitudinal factors and processes were experiencing job stress, perceiving stigmatization, coping by avoiding crowds and colleagues, and feeling scrutinized. Pre-existing trait factors also contributed to vulnerability. Lessons learned from the outbreak include: (i) that effort is required to mitigate the psychological impact of infection control procedures, especially the interpersonal isolation that these procedures promote; (ii) that effective risk communication is a priority early in an outbreak; (iii) that healthcare workers may have a role in influencing patterns of media coverage that increase or decrease morale; (iv) that healthcare workers benefit from resources that facilitate reflection on the effects of extraordinary stressors; and (v) that healthcare workers benefit from practical interventions that demonstrate tangible support from institutions.

EAPCI Position Statement on Invasive Management of Acute Coronary Syndromes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge to healthcare worldwide. The infection can be life threatening and require intensive care treatment. The transmission of the disease poses a risk to both patients and healthcare workers. The number of patients requiring hospital admission and intensive care may overwhelm health systems and negatively affect standard care for patients presenting with conditions needing emergency interventions. This position statements aims to assist cardiologists in the invasive management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. To that end, we assembled a panel of interventional cardiologists and acute cardiac care specialists appointed by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) and from the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association (ACVC) and included the experience from the first and worst affected areas in Europe. Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge. Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described. In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries. Furthermore, we provide a guidance to reorganization of catheterization laboratories and, importantly, measures for protection of healthcare providers involved with invasive procedures.

Quantitative assessment of consciousness during anesthesia without EEG data.

Assessing the depth of anesthesia (DoA) is a daily challenge for anesthesiologists. The best assessment of the depth of anesthesia is commonly thought to be the one made by the doctor in charge of the patient. This evaluation is based on the integration of several parameters including epidemiological, pharmacological and physiological data. By developing a protocol to record synchronously all these parameters we aim at having this evaluation made by an algorithm. Our hypothesis was that the standard parameters recorded during anesthesia (without EEG) could provide a good insight into the consciousness level of the patient. We developed a complete solution for high-resolution longitudinal follow-up of patients during anesthesia. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was trained on the database in order to predict and assess states based on four physiological variables that were adjusted to the consciousness level: Heart Rate (HR), Mean Blood Pressure (MeanBP) Respiratory Rate (RR), and AA Inspiratory Concentration (AAFi) all without using EEG recordings. Patients undergoing general anesthesia for hernial inguinal repair were included after informed consent. The algorithm was tested on 30 patients. The percentage of error to identify the actual state among Awake, LOC, Anesthesia, ROC and Emergence was 18%. This protocol constitutes the very first step on the way towards a multimodal approach of anesthesia. The fact that our first classifier already demonstrated a good predictability is very encouraging for the future. Indeed, this first model was merely a proof of concept to encourage research ways in the field of machine learning and anesthesia.

Formatted for Journal of Clinical Virology

BACKGROUND: Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are highly prevalent, genetically diverse, and associated with both mild upper respiratory tract and more severe lower tract illnesses (LRTI). OBJECTIVE: To characterize the molecular epidemiology of HRV infections in young children seeking acute medical care. STUDY DESIGN: Nasal swabs collected from symptomatic children <3 years of age receiving care in the Emergency and Urgent Care Departments at Seattle Children's Hospital were analyzed by a rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system (FilmArray®) for multiple viruses including HRV/enterovirus. HRV-positive results were confirmed by laboratory-developed real-time reverse transcription PCR (LD-PCR). Clinical data were collected by chart review. A subset of samples was selected for sequencing using the 5’ noncoding region. Associations between LRTI and HRV species and genotypes were estimated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 595 samples with HRV/enterovirus detected by FilmArray, 474 (80%) were confirmed as HRV by LD-PCR. 211 (96%) of 218 selected samples were sequenced; HRV species A, B, and C were identified in 133 (63%), 6 (3%), and 72 (34%), respectively. LRTI was more common in HRVC than HRV-A illness episodes (adjusted OR [95% CI] 2.35[1.03-5.35). Specific HRV-A and HRV-C genotypes detected in multiple patients were associated with a greater proportion of LRTI episodes. In 18 patients with >1 HRV-positive illness episodes, a distinct genotype was detected in each. CONCLUSION: Diverse HRV genotypes circulated among symptomatic children during the study period. We found an association between HRV-C infections and LRTI in this patient population and evidence of association between specific HRV genotypes and LRTI.

Targeting of 111In-labeled dendritic cell human vaccines improved by reducing number of cells.

PURPOSE Anticancer dendritic cell (DC) vaccines require the DCs to relocate to lymph nodes (LN) to trigger immune responses. However, these migration rates are typically very poor. Improving the targeting of ex vivo generated DCs to LNs might increase vaccine efficacy and reduce costs. We investigated DC migration in vivo in humans under different conditions. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN HLA-A*02:01 patients with melanoma were vaccinated with mature DCs loaded with tyrosinase and gp100 peptides together with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (NCT00243594). For this study, patients received an additional intradermal vaccination with (111)In-labeled mature DCs. The injection site was pretreated with nonloaded, activated DCs, TNFα, or Imiquimod; granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor was coinjected or smaller numbers of DCs were injected. Migration was measured by scintigraphy and compared with an intrapatient control vaccination. In an ex vivo tissue model, we measured CCL21-directed migration of (19)F-labeled DCs over a period of up to 12 hours using (19)F MRI to supplement our patient data. RESULTS Pretreatment of the injection site induced local inflammatory reactions but did not improve migration rates. Both in vitro and in vivo, reduction of cell numbers to 5 × 10(6) or less cells per injection improved migration. Furthermore, scintigraphy is insufficient to study migration of such small numbers of (111)In-labeled DCs in vivo. CONCLUSION Reduction of cell density, not pretreatment of the injection site, is crucial for improved migration of DCs to LNs in vivo.

Engineering the largest RNA virus genome as an infectious bacterial artificial chromosome.

The construction of cDNA clones encoding large-size RNA molecules of biological interest, like coronavirus genomes, which are among the largest mature RNA molecules known to biology, has been hampered by the instability of those cDNAs in bacteria. Herein, we show that the application of two strategies, cloning of the cDNAs into a bacterial artificial chromosome and nuclear expression of RNAs that are typically produced within the cytoplasm, is useful for the engineering of large RNA molecules. A cDNA encoding an infectious coronavirus RNA genome has been cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome. The rescued coronavirus conserved all of the genetic markers introduced throughout the sequence and showed a standard mRNA pattern and the antigenic characteristics expected for the synthetic virus. The cDNA was transcribed within the nucleus, and the RNA translocated to the cytoplasm. Interestingly, the recovered virus had essentially the same sequence as the original one, and no splicing was observed. The cDNA was derived from an attenuated isolate that replicates exclusively in the respiratory tract of swine. During the engineering of the infectious cDNA, the spike gene of the virus was replaced by the spike gene of an enteric isolate. The synthetic virus replicated abundantly in the enteric tract and was fully virulent, demonstrating that the tropism and virulence of the recovered coronavirus can be modified. This demonstration opens up the possibility of employing this infectious cDNA as a vector for vaccine development in human, porcine, canine, and feline species susceptible to group 1 coronaviruses.

Single-cell RNA-seq and V(D)J profiling of immune cells in COVID-19 patients

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused over 220,000 deaths so far and is still an ongoing global health problem. However, the immunopathological changes of key types of immune cells during and after virus infection remain unclear. Here, we enriched CD3+ and CD19+ lymphocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of COVID-19 patients (severe patients and recovered patients at early or late stages) and healthy people (SARS-CoV-2 negative) and revealed transcriptional profiles and changes in these lymphocytes by comprehensive single-cell transcriptome and V(D)J recombination analyses. We found that although the T lymphocytes were decreased in the blood of patients with virus infection, the remaining T cells still highly expressed inflammatory genes and persisted for a while after recovery in patients. We also observed the potential transition from effector CD8 T cells to central memory T cells in recovered patients at the late stage. Among B lymphocytes, we analyzed the expansion trajectory of a subtype of plasma cells in severe COVID-19 patients and traced the source as atypical memory B cells (AMBCs). Additional BCR and TCR analyses revealed a high level of clonal expansion in patients with severe COVID-19, especially of B lymphocytes, and the clonally expanded B cells highly expressed genes related to inflammatory responses and lymphocyte activation. V-J gene usage and clonal types of higher frequency in COVID-19 patients were also summarized. Taken together, our results provide crucial insights into the immune response against patients with severe COVID-19 and recovered patients and valuable information for the development of vaccines and therapeutic strategies.

Intra-model Variability in COVID-19 Classification Using Chest X-ray Images

X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scanning technologies for COVID-19 screening have gained significant traction in AI research since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite these continuous advancements for COVID-19 screening, many concerns remain about model reliability when used in a clinical setting. Much has been published, but with limited transparency in expected model performance. We set out to address this limitation through a set of experiments to quantify baseline performance metrics and variability for COVID-19 detection in chest x-ray for 12 common deep learning architectures. Specifically, we adopted an experimental paradigm controlling for train-validation-test split and model architecture where the source of prediction variability originates from model weight initialization, random data augmentation transformations, and batch shuffling. Each model architecture was trained 5 separate times on identical train-validation-test splits of a publicly available x-ray image dataset provided by Cohen et al. (2020). Results indicate that even within model architectures, model behavior varies in a meaningful way between trained models. Best performing models achieve a false negative rate of 3 out of 20 for detecting COVID-19 in a hold-out set. While these results show promise in using AI for COVID-19 screening, they further support the urgent need for diverse medical imaging datasets for model training in a way that yields consistent prediction outcomes. It is our hope that these modeling results accelerate work in building a more robust dataset and a viable screening tool for COVID-19.

Hemodialysis catheter tip design: observations on fluid flow and recirculation.

PURPOSE To observe fluid flow patterns and measure recirculation rates of tunneled hemodialysis catheters using a mechanical model that simulates hemodialysis treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS Nine tunneled hemodialysis catheters were evaluated using a mechanical model that simulated catheter conditions during a routine hemodialysis treatment. Objective and subjective determinants of catheter performance were measured and compared. Catheters were evaluated with blood lines connected in standard and reversed configurations using a fluid flow rate of 425 ml/min. RESULTS With blood lines in standard configuration the Split Cath® was the only catheter to exhibit an atypical fluid flow pattern and significant tip movement. When the blood lines were reversed, three split-tip catheters had significant tip movement. The three step-tip catheters and two symmetric tip catheters had stable fluid flow patterns and no significant tip movement with blood lines connected in standard and reverse configurations.The nine catheters had no recirculation when connected in standard configuration. When the blood lines were reversed the percentage of recirculating fluid for symmetric tip, step-tip, and split-tip catheters was 0%, 15% to 20%, and 20% to 30%, respectively. The Equistream®, Palindrome™, and Symetrex catheters had no recirculation with blood lines connected in standard or reversed configurations. CONCLUSIONS Eight of the nine catheters evaluated in this study performed well with blood lines connected in standard configuration. When blood lines were reversed, symmetric tip and step-tip designs had more stable fluid flow patterns, less tip movement and lower recirculation rates when compared to split-tip designs.

Nidovirales

This chapter focuses on the Nidovirales order whose member families include Arteriviridae, Coronaviridae, and Roniviridae. The nidoviruses genome is an infectious, linear, positive sense RNA molecule, which is capped and polyadenylated. Based on the genome size, they are divided into two groups large and small nidoviruses. The genomes of the large nidoviruses are well over 25 kb in length with size differences in the 5 kb range. Based on the genome size, they can be distinguished into two groups, large and small nidoviruses. The genomes of the large nidoviruses are well over 25 kb in length with size differences in the 5 kb range. Although the structural proteins of the nidoviruses are generally functionally equivalent, there is no firm indication that any single protein species is evolutionary conserved across all of the families. Members of the family Coronaviridae generally possess three or four envelope proteins. The most abundant one is the membrane (M) protein. Though different in sequence, the M proteins of corona-, toro-, and bafiniviruses are alike in size, structure, and presumably also in function. Nidoviruses have lipid envelopes, which are commonly acquired by budding at membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, intermediate compartment and/or Golgi complex. In coronaviruses, the S protein is an important target for T cell responses and is the major inducer of virus-neutralizing antibodies, which are elicited by epitopes located mostly in the N-terminal half of the molecule.

Chest CT Scan of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: A Case-Control Study

Introduction: This paper sought to investigate the clinical characteristic differences between suspected and confirmed patients with COVID-19 from CT scan to prevent and treat this infectious disease, since the coronavirus outbreak in the world has seriously affected the quality of life. Methods: We proposed to use a retrospective case-control study to give a comparison between suspected patients and confirmed patients in the clinical characteristics. Results: (56%) patients were confirmed for COVID-19 from suspected 167 patients. We find that elder people were more likely to be infected by COVID-19. Among the confirmed 94 patients, 2 (2%) patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 0 (0%) patients died during the study period. We find that images of CT scan of patients with a COVID-19 are significantly different from patients without a COVID-19. Conclusions: To our best knowledge, it is the first time to use the case-control design to study the coronavirus disease, since it is particularly appropriate for investigating infectious disease outbreaks. The clinical treatment experience in this study can supply a guideline for treating COVID-19 as the number of the infected patients is increasing in the world. Compared with other studies, we find that the mortality rate and the intensive care unit rate can be reduced if patients can be treated timely in the right identification and detection with nucleic acid testing and chest CT scan. Therefore, we recommend nucleic acid testing and chest CT scan for the clinical treatment practice from this successful clinical treatment study.

Chapter Three Nucleic Acid Induced Interferon and Inflammasome Responses in Regulating Host Defense to Gastrointestinal Viruses

Abstract The gut bacterial and fungal communities residing in the gastrointestinal tract have undisputed far-reaching effects in regulating host health. In the meantime, however, metagenomic sequencing efforts are revealing enteric viruses as the most abundant dimension of the intestinal gut ecosystem, and the first gut virome-wide association studies showed that inflammatory bowel disease as well as type 1 diabetes could be linked to the presence or absence of particular viral inhabitants in the intestine. In line with the genetic component of these human diseases, mouse model studies demonstrated how beneficial functions of a resident virus can switch to detrimental inflammatory effects in a genetically predisposed host. Such viral-induced intestinal immune disturbances are also recapitulated by several gastrointestinal infectious viruses such as rotavirus and human norovirus. This wide range of viral effects on intestinal immunity emphasizes the need for understanding the innate immune responses to gastrointestinal viruses. Numerous nucleic acid sensors such as DexD/H helicases and AIM2 serve as cytosolic viral guardians to induce antiviral interferon and/or pro-inflammatory inflammasome responses. In both cases, pioneering examples are emerging in which RNA helicases cooperate with particular Nod-like receptors to trigger these cellular responses to enteric viruses. Here we summarize the reported beneficial versus detrimental effects of enteric viruses in the intestinal immune system, and we zoom in on the mechanisms through which sensing of nucleic acids from these enteric viruses trigger interferon and inflammasome responses.

Regulation of TGF-β signaling by Smad7

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is a pleiotropic cytokine regulating a variety of cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, cell adhesion, and immune response. In the well-understood classical TGF-β signaling pathway, TGF-β activates Smad signalling via its two cell surface receptors such as TβRII and ALK5/TβRI, leading to Smad-mediated transcriptional regulation. In addition, TGF-β may also activate other signaling pathways like mitogen-activated protein kinase, PI3K, etc. The signaling of TGF-β is finely regulated at different levels. Inhibitory Smads, including Smad6 and Smad7, are key regulators of TGF-β/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling by negative feedback loops. They can form stable complexes with activated type I receptors and thereby blocking the phosphorylation of R-Smads, or recruit ubiquitin E3 ligases, such as Smurf1/2, resulting in the ubiquitination and degradation of the activated type I receptors. Besides, these inhibitory Smad proteins also inhibit TGF-β/BMP signaling in the nucleus by interacting with transcriptional repressors, such as histone deacetylases, Hoxc-8, and CtBP, or disrupting the formation of the TGF-β-induced functional Smad-DNA complexes. Smad7 is in turn regulated by different stimuli, including TGF-β, IFN-γ, TNF-α as well as ultraviolet and TPA, and mediates the crosstalk between TGF-β and other signaling pathways. Deregulation of Smad7 expression has been associated with various human diseases, such as tissue fibrosis, inflammatory disease as well as carcinogenesis. Overexpression of Smad7 has been shown to antagonize TGF-β-mediated fibrosis, carcinogenesis, and inflammation, suggesting a therapeutic potential of Smad7 to treat these diseases.

Comparing glomerular filtration rate equations and the impact of different creatinine assays on the assessment of renal function in cancer patients.

BACKGROUND Equations to estimate glomerular filtration rate based on serum creatinine are commonly used in cancer patients to assess renal function. However, there is uncertainty regarding which equation is most appropriate for this population and the impact of different creatinine assays. METHODS Measured isotopic glomerular filtration rate results from 120 oncology patients were used to evaluate and compare all four versions of the Wright equation, Cockcroft and Gault, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration and the Janowitz and Williams formula; using eight different creatinine assays (five Jaffe, three enzymatic). RESULTS The enzymatic version of the Wright equation without creatine kinase performed better than the other versions for all eight creatinine assays. However, MDRD and Janowitz and Williams gave the best overall performance in this patient population. Performance was highly dependent on the creatinine assay used, for example, the percentage of results within 30% of the isotopic glomerular filtration rate (P30) ranged from 90.8% to 60.8% for MDRD. CONCLUSION The performance of any equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate is highly dependent on the creatinine assay used. Oncology units should assess the performance of glomerular filtration rate equations using their laboratory creatinine assay to determine whether they can be used safely and effectively in cancer patients.

Barbed versus usual suture for closure of the gastrojejunal anastomosis in laparoscopic gastric bypass: a comparative trial.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is one of the main bariatric procedures that require safe and reproducible anastomosis. The objective of this study is to compare the risk of leaks and stenosis of a mechanical gastric pouch jejunal anastomosis between the usual interrupted sutures and a continuous barbed suture for gastrojejunotomy, in order to reduce procedure time and costs. METHODS A comparative trial of 100 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was performed between October 2010 and July 2011. The population was divided into two groups of 50 consecutive patients. In the first group, gastrojejunotomy was sutured with resorbable interrupted sutures and the second with continuous barbed suture. Diabetes, body mass index and the American Society of Anaesthesiology score were compared. The time required for suturing and the incidence of anastomotic leaks and stricture were also compared after 6 months. RESULTS No fistulas or anastomotic stenoses had occurred at post-operative month 6 in either group. Gastrojejunotomy suture time was significantly shorter in the barbed suture group (11 versus 8.22 min; p < 0.01). Total costs of material to complete the reconstruction were significantly lower in the barbed suture group (€26.69 versus €18.33; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The use of barbed suture is as safe as usual sutures and allows easier and faster suture in the closure of gastrojejunotomy. This suture could be incorporated in the standard laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass technique.

The Fate of Mengovirus on Fiberglass Filter of Air Handling Units

One of the most important topics that occupy public health problems is the air quality. That is the reason why mechanical ventilation and air handling units (AHU) were imposed by the different governments in the collective or individual buildings. Many buildings create an artificial climate using heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems. Among the existing aerosols in the indoor air, we can distinguish the bioaerosol with biological nature such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Respiratory viral infections are a major public health issue because they are usually highly infective. We spend about 90% of our time in closed environments such as homes, workplaces, or transport. Some studies have shown that AHU contribute to the spread and transport of viral particles within buildings. The aim of this work is to study the characterization of viral bioaerosols in indoor environments and to understand the fate of mengovirus eukaryote RNA virus on glass fiber filter F7 used in AHU. In this study, a set-up close to reality of AHU system was used. The mengovirus aerosolized was characterized and measured with the electrical low pressure impact and the scanner mobility particle size and detected with RT-qPCR. The results about quantification and the level of infectivity of mengovirus on the filter and in the biosampler showed that mengovirus can pass through the filter and remain infectious upstream and downstream the system. Regarding the virus infectivity on the filter under a constant air flow, mengovirus was remained infectious during 10 h after aerosolization.

Disaster preparedness for earthquakes in hemodialysis units in Gyeongju and Pohang, South Korea

In 2016 and 2017, there were earthquakes greater than 5.0 in magnitude on the Korean Peninsula, which has previously been considered an earthquake-free zone. Patients with chronic kidney disease are particularly vulnerable to earthquakes, as the term “renal disaster” suggests. In the event of a major earthquake, patients on hemodialysis face the risk of losing maintenance dialysis due to infrastructure disruption. In this review, we share the experience of an earthquake in Pohang that posed a serious risk to patients on hemodialysis. We review the disaster response system in Japan and propose a disaster preparedness plan with respect to hemodialysis. Korean nephrologists and staff in dialysis facilities should be trained in emergency response to mitigate risk from natural disasters. Dialysis staff should be familiar with the action plan for natural disaster events that disrupt hemodialysis, such as outages and water treatment system failures caused by earthquakes. Patients on hemodialysis also need to be educated about disaster preparedness. In the event of a disaster situation that results in dialysis failure, patients need to know what to do. At the local and national government level, long-term preparations should be made to handle renal disaster and patient safety logistics. Moreover, Korean nephrologists should also be prepared to manage cardiovascular disease and diabetes in disaster situations. Further evaluation and management of social and national disaster preparedness of hemodialysis units to earthquakes in Korea are needed.

Lactate dehydrogenase and susceptibility to deterioration of mild COVID-19 patients: a multicenter nested case-control study

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 4 million people within 4 months. There is an urgent need to properly identify high-risk cases that are more likely to deteriorate even if they present mild diseases on admission. METHODS: A multicenter nested case-control study was conducted in four designated hospitals in China enrolling confirmed COVID-19 patients who were mild on admission. Baseline clinical characteristics were compared between patients with stable mild illness (stable mild group) and those who deteriorated from mild to severe illness (progression group). RESULTS: From Jan 17, 2020, to Feb 1, 2020, 85 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled, including 16 in the progression group and 69 in the stable mild group. Compared to stable mild group (n = 69), patients in the progression group (n = 16) were more likely to be older, male, presented with dyspnea, with hypertension, and with higher levels of lactase dehydrogenase and c-reactive protein. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, advanced age (odds ratio [OR], 1.012; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.020–1.166; P = 0.011) and the higher level of lactase dehydrogenase (OR, 1.012; 95% CI, 1.001–1.024; P = 0.038) were independently associated with exacerbation in mild COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Advanced age and high LDH level are independent risk factors for exacerbation in mild COVID-19 patients. Among the mild patients, clinicians should pay more attention to the elderly patients or those with high LDH levels.

Early chest computed tomography to diagnose COVID-19 from suspected patients: A multicenter retrospective study

Objective: The purpose of this study is to distinguish the imaging features of COVID-19 with other chest infectious diseases and evaluate diagnostic value of chest CT for suspected patients. Methods: Adult suspected patients aged >18 years within 14 days who underwent chest CT scan and reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) tests were enrolled. The enrolled patients were confirmed and grouped according to results of RT-PCR tests. The data of basic demographics, single chest CT features, and combined chest CT features were analyzed for confirmed and non-confirmed groups. Results: A total of 130 patients were enrolled with 54 cases positive and 76 cases negative. The typical CT imaging features of positive group were ground glass opacity (GGO), crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram. The lesions were mostly distributed bilaterally, close to the lower lungs or the pleura. When features combined, GGO with bilateral pulmonary distribution and GGO with pleural distribution were more common, of which were 31 cases (57.4%) and 30 cases (55.6%) respectively. The combinations were almost presented statistically significant (P<0.05) except for the combination of GGO with consolidation. Most combinations presented relatively low sensitivity but extremely high specificity. The average specificity of these combinations is around 90%. Conclusions: The combinations of GGO could be useful in the identification and differential diagnosis of COVID-19, which alerts clinicians to isolate patients for treatment promptly and repeat RT-PCR tests until incubation ends.

[Analysis of the first cluster of cases in a family of novel coronavirus pneumonia in Gansu Province].

The epidemiological history and clinical characteristics of 7 cases of COVID-19 and 1 case of close contact in the first family aggregation epidemic of COVID-19 in Gansu Province were analyzed. The first patient A developed on January 22, 2020, with a history of residence in Wuhan, and confirmed severe cases of NCP on January 24, 2020; patient B, on January 23, 2020, diagnosed on January 31, severe cases; patient C, asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 27; patient D, asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 27; patient E, on January 24, diagnosed on January 28; patient F, asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 31; Patient G was asymptomatic and was diagnosed on January 31. In close contact, H was asymptomatic, PCR test was negative and asymptomatic, and he was discharged early. Among the 7 patients, 1 case died of (B) aggravation, and the other patients' condition was effectively controlled after active treatment. Except for the discharged cases, 5 cases were positive for COVID-19 specific IgM antibody and 1 case was negative. In this clustering outbreak, 4 patients remained asymptomatic, but PCR and IgM antibodies were positive, indicating that asymptomatic patients may be the key point to control the epidemic. Specific IgM antibody screening for patients whose pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test is negative but with ground glass-like lung lesions is very important for early detection and early isolation.

Prospective study of respiratory viral infections in pediatric hemopoietic stem cell transplantation patients.

BACKGROUND Community-acquired respiratory viruses are an important cause of respiratory disease in pediatric patients undergoing hemopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, there are no studies examining the impact of more rapid and sensitive diagnosis by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in this population. We performed a prospective study to assess the impact of real time PCR diagnosis as well as protective isolation for community-acquired respiratory virus infections in pediatric patients undergoing hemopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHODS During a 2-year period, 39 pediatric patients undergoing hemopoietic stem cell transplantation were analyzed for presence of respiratory viruses. Samples were taken at regular intervals and analyzed by culture and newly developed real time PCR methods. All patients were cared for in protective isolation. RESULTS Respiratory symptoms were observed in 10 of the 39 cases (26%) and a virus was identified in 8 and 6 of these cases by PCR and culture, respectively. The PCR detected the respiratory infection a median of 8 days before culture. However, the morbidity of the respiratory infections was generally mild, and no mortality was observed. Additionally all infections were observed pretransplant or after discharge; no nosocomial infections were observed. CONCLUSIONS The real time PCR assay is more rapid and sensitive than culture and could be used to screen patients before transplant or as respiratory symptoms present for timely diagnosis.

Influence of the pandemic dissemination of COVID-19 on radiotherapy practice: A flash survey in Germany, Austria and Switzerland

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has already changed our globalised world and its long-term impact is not yet known. It is apparent that businesses and institutions are increasingly affected. COVID-19 discussions often focus on intensive care units in hospitals. However, COVID-19 also effects life-saving and -prolonging radiotherapy for patients suffering from cancer. METHOD: We have conducted a structured online survey among medical physicists in Germany, Austria and Switzerland from March 23rd to 26th 2020. In total 154 responses (82 completed, 72 partially completed) were analysed in the context of the COVID-19 dissemination. RESULTS: 72.4% of the respondent’s state that their processes are affected due to COVID-19, while the top three answers are longer processing times (54.2%), patient no-shows (42.5%) and staff reduction (36.7%). 75.8% expect further unavailability of their personnel in the upcoming weeks. All participants have already taken several measures, especially providing information for patients at the entrance (89.6%) or over the phone (73.6%), restricting access for accompanying persons (77.4%) and providing disinfectant at the entrance (72.6%). DISCUSSION: The results presented in this article aim to support business continuity and risk management for radiotherapy centres to prepare for future challenges. The results show that most radiotherapy centres has implemented initial contingency measures, applying them pragmatically. The main problem however remains, that is the high risk of infection both for patients and medical personnel along with the associated risk of temporarily loss of personnel and ordered closure of business.

The Nature of Protein Domain Evolution: Shaping the Interaction Network

The proteomes that make up the collection of proteins in contemporary organisms evolved through recombination and duplication of a limited set of domains. These protein domains are essentially the main components of globular proteins and are the most principal level at which protein function and protein interactions can be understood. An important aspect of domain evolution is their atomic structure and biochemical function, which are both specified by the information in the amino acid sequence. Changes in this information may bring about new folds, functions and protein architectures. With the present and still increasing wealth of sequences and annotation data brought about by genomics, new evolutionary relationships are constantly being revealed, unknown structures modeled and phylogenies inferred. Such investigations not only help predict the function of newly discovered proteins, but also assist in mapping unforeseen pathways of evolution and reveal crucial, co-evolving inter- and intra-molecular interactions. In turn this will help us describe how protein domains shaped cellular interaction networks and the dynamics with which they are regulated in the cell. Additionally, these studies can be used for the design of new and optimized protein domains for therapy. In this review, we aim to describe the basic concepts of protein domain evolution and illustrate recent developments in molecular evolution that have provided valuable new insights in the field of comparative genomics and protein interaction networks.

Hazardous Postoperative Outcomes of Unexpected COVID-19 Infected Patients: A Call for Global Consideration of Sampling all Asymptomatic Patients Before Surgical Treatment

BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of many pneumonia cases in China and eventually declared as a pandemic as the virus spread globally. Few reports were published on the outcome of surgical procedures in diagnosed COVID-19 patients and even fewer on the surgical outcomes of asymptomatic undiagnosed COVID-19 surgical patients. We aimed to review all published data regarding surgical outcomes of preoperatively asymptomatic untested coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: This report is a review on the perioperative period in COVID-19 patients who were preoperatively asymptomatic and not tested for COVID-19. Searches were conducted in PubMed April 4th, 2020. All publications, of any design, were considered for inclusion. RESULTS: Four reports were identified through our literature search, comprising 64 COVID-19 carriers, of them 51 were diagnosed only in the postoperative period. Synthesis of these reports, concerning the postoperative outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during the perioperative period, suggested a 14/51 (27.5%) postoperative mortality rate and severe mostly pulmonic complications, as well as medical staff exposure and transmission. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 may have potential hazardous implications on the perioperative course. Our review presents results of unacceptable mortality rate and a high rate of severe complications. These observations warrant further well-designed studies, yet we believe it is time for a global consideration of sampling all asymptomatic patients before surgical treatment.

Early Hemoglobin kinetics in response to ribavirin: Safety lesson learned from Hepatitis C to CoVID-19 therapy

Background: Ribavirin (RBV) is been used for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This drug is associated with a wide range of side effects, mainly anemia, so its use in patients with potential respiratory affectation could not be appropriate. The evidences of adverse events associated with RBV-use has mainly been derived in the context of hepatitis C (HCV) treatment, however the possible use of RBV in CoVID-19 patients could be limited to 14 days. Methods: Longitudinal study including HIV/HCV coinfected patients. We evaluate the hemoglobin dynamics and reductions as well as evaluate the development rate of anemia during the first 2 weeks of therapy in HCV infected patients. Results: 189 patients were included in the study. The median hemoglobin levels were 14.6 g/dL (IQR: 13.2-15.6 g/dL) and 13.5 g/dL (IQR: 12.3-14.5 g/dL) at weeks 1 and 2 of therapy, respectively. A cumulative number of 27 (14.2%) patients developed anemia (23 grade 1 [12.1%] and 4 grade 2 [2.1%]). We identify a baseline hemoglobin levels of 14 g/dL as the better cut-off to identify those patients with a high chance to develop anemia. Of the 132 patients with baseline hemoglobin level >14 g/dL, 8 developed anemia (6.1%) compared with 19 of 57 (33.3%) with hemoglobin levels lower than 14 g/dL (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our study shows valuable information about the early hemoglobin kinetic timing in patients on RBV-therapy, that could be useful to tailor CoVID-19 treatment if RBV use is considered.

A novel porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus vector system that stably expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein as a separate transcription unit

Here we report the rescue of a recombinant porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) carrying an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene as a separate transcription unit. A copy of the transcription regulatory sequence for ORF6 (TRS6) was inserted between the N protein and 3′-UTR to drive the transcription of the EGFP gene and yield a general purpose expression vector. Successful recovery of PRRSV was obtained using an RNA polymerase II promoter to drive transcription of the full-length virus genome, which was assembled in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). The recombinant virus showed growth replication characteristics similar to those of the wild-type virus in the infected cells. In addition, the recombinant virus stably expressed EGFP for at least 10 passages. EGFP expression was detected at approximately 10 h post infection by live-cell imaging to follow the virus spread in real time and the infection of neighbouring cells occurred predominantly through cell-to-cell-contact. Finally, the recombinant virus generated was found to be an excellent tool for neutralising antibodies and antiviral compound screening. The newly established reverse genetics system for PRRSV could be a useful tool not only to monitor virus spread and screen for neutralising antibodies and antiviral compounds, but also for fundamental research on the biology of the virus.

Fenestra Obscura: Flow Diverter Reconstruction of a Complex Vertebrobasilar Aneurysm Through an Obscured Fenestration Limb: Technical Case Report.

BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE Basilar fenestration aneurysms are rare, challenging intracranial vascular lesions with atypical anatomy. The posterior circulation represents a difficult therapeutic dilemma because of the close proximity of crucial life-sustaining brainstem structures. The use of flow diverter technology has been very limited in posterior circulation vessels. CLINICAL PRESENTATION We present the case of a 49-year-old female patient, who was diagnosed with a symptomatic large vertebrobasilar junction aneurysm, which was initially thought to be a proximal basilar dilatation. The aneurysm was later verified to arise from the proximal end of a basilar fenestration, distended by the aneurysm fundus. The small-caliber fenestration limbs were the only connection to the distal basilar artery, but were stretched laterally and concealed by the aneurysm fundus. This complex lesion was successfully treated by flow diverter deployment through one of the fenestration limbs, followed by coiling of the aneurysm fundus, and sacrificing the contralateral vertebral artery. A 6-month follow-up angiogram showed remodeling of the basilar artery and complete occlusion of the aneurysm with good clinical outcome. Careful diagnostic workup, multidisciplinary discussions, and the innovative use of versatile endovascular technology were crucial to achieve an optimal result in this case. CONCLUSION This is the first report of a successful basilar artery reconstruction for the treatment of a large atypical vertebrobasilar junction fenestration aneurysm by deployment of a flow diverter device directly in a small, obscured fenestration limb.

Acute Recanalization of Thrombo-Embolic Ischemic Stroke with pREset (ARTESp): the impact of occlusion time on clinical outcome of directly admitted and transferred patients.

OBJECTIVES Acute Recanalization of Thrombo-Embolic Ischemic Stroke with pREset (ARTESp) is a prospective multicenter study assessing the efficacy and safety of the pREset stent retriever for the treatment of intracranial vessel occlusion. Determination of the effect of transfer status on clinical outcome was a secondary objective. METHODS Efficacy was measured by recanalization success (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score ≥2b) and favorable clinical outcome at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale 0-2). Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and death at 90 days were safety measures. The outcome of directly admitted (DAP) and transferred (TP) patients was investigated using multivariable regression models. RESULTS Four study centers included 100 patients (mean age 68.3 years, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 15). Recanalization success was achieved in 84.4% after a mean of 1.7 passes. ICH was detected in 14.0%, with 2.0% being symptomatic. At 90 days, 62.5% of the patients had a favorable outcome and 7.3% died. TP had longer occlusion times (289 vs 180 minutes, p<0.001) and a lower rate of favorable outcome (58.0% vs 78.4%, p=0.046) than DAP. Multivariable regression revealed occlusion time as the critical determinant (OR=0.963, 95% CI 0.931 to 0.997, p=0.032), whereas transfer status itself showed no significant association (OR=0.565, CI 0.133 to 2.393, p=0.438). CONCLUSIONS pREset proved to be safe and effective for the treatment of acute intracranial vessel occlusion. Increased occlusion time impaired clinical outcome in TP. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER NCT02437409; Results.

Viral Infections in Children in the 2014/2015 Epidemic Season in Poland

In every epidemic season, viral infections affect the general population, including children, which is an underestimated issue. The present study demonstrates the results of examination of 802 clinical samples obtained from pediatric patients aged 0–14 years during the 2014/2015 epidemic season in Poland. The study was part of the virological surveillance systems – SENTINEL and NON-SENTINEL. A positive result for virological infection was obtained in 50.9 % of samples tested. The distribution of positive results by the age-groups was as follows: 38.2 % in 0–4 years old, 8.5 % in 5–9 years old, and 4.2 % in 10–14 years old children. Influenza viruses accounted for 48.0 % and influenza-like viruses for 52.0 % of all positive samples. Concerning the influenza virus, molecular biology-based techniques confirmed the infection caused by influenza type A in 63.3 % of samples, consisting of unsubtyped A virus detected in 65.3 % of cases of this sample group, subtype A/H1N1/pdm09 in 28.2 %, and subtype A/H3N2/ in 6.5 %. Genetic material of influenza B was detected in 36.7 % of samples. In a group of influenza-like viruses, the predominant virus was respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in as many as 96.2 % of samples, followed by parainfluenza viruses: PIV3 – 1.4 % and PIV1 – 1.0 %. Attention should be paid to the coinfection of respiratory viruses. There were six possible coinfection combinations reported in Poland, with four of them related to children up to 14 years old.

Plasma Amino Acid Concentrations of Horses Grazing Alfalfa, Cool-Season Perennial Grasses, and Teff.

The impact of forage species on plasma amino acid (AA) concentrations of grazing horses (Equus caballus L.) is unknown. The objectives of this study were to determine the impact of different forage species on plasma AA concentrations and protein synthesis. Research was conducted in July in St. Paul, MN, USA. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), mixed perennial cool-season grasses (CSGs), and teff (Eragrostis tef [Zucc.] Trotter) pastures were grazed by six horses randomly assigned to one of three forage types in a replicated Latin-square design. Horses had access to pasture each day. Jugular venous blood samples were collected from each horse before being turned out (0 hours) and then at 2 and 4 hours after turnout. Corresponding forage samples were taken by hand harvest and analyzed for AA concentrations. Equine muscle satellite cell cultures were treated with sera from grazing horses to assess de novo protein synthesis. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED in SAS. When evaluating forage, AA concentrations were generally lowest in teff and highest in CSG (P ≤ .05). Significant differences in threonine concentration in the plasma were observed; there was no effect on de novo protein synthesis of cultured equine myotubes treated with plasma obtained from the grazing horses (P ≥ .20). As a result, although there were significant differences in forage AA content, only plasma threonine concentration was different at 4 hours with no effect on protein synthesis of cultured equine satellite cells.

SARS-CoV-2 Infections and Serologic Responses from a Sample of U.S. Navy Service Members — USS Theodore Roosevelt, April 2020

Compared with the volume of data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks among older adults, relatively few data are available concerning COVID-19 in younger, healthy persons in the United States (1,2). In late March 2020, the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt arrived at port in Guam after numerous U.S. service members onboard developed COVID-19. In April, the U.S. Navy and CDC investigated this outbreak, and the demographic, epidemiologic, and laboratory findings among a convenience sample of 382 service members serving aboard the aircraft carrier are reported in this study. The outbreak was characterized by widespread transmission with relatively mild symptoms and asymptomatic infection among this sample of mostly young, healthy adults with close, congregate exposures. Service members who reported taking preventive measures had a lower infection rate than did those who did not report taking these measures (e.g., wearing a face covering, 55.8% versus 80.8%; avoiding common areas, 53.8% versus 67.5%; and observing social distancing, 54.7% versus 70.0%, respectively). The presence of neutralizing antibodies, which represent antibodies that inhibit SARS-CoV-2, among the majority (59.2%) of those with antibody responses is a promising indicator of at least short-term immunity. This report improves the understanding of COVID-19 in the U.S. military and among young adults in congregate settings and reinforces the importance of preventive measures to lower risk for infection in similar environments.

Diagnosis, Outcome, and Management of Chylous Ascites Following Pediatric Liver Transplantation

Data on postoperative chylous ascites (CA) after pediatric liver transplantation (LT) are scarce. This retrospective study was conducted to identify the incidence, risk factors, management, and outcomes of postoperative CA in a large single‐center pediatric LT cohort (2000‐2016). The study cohort comprised 317 LTs (153 living donors and 164 deceased donors) in 310 recipients with a median age of 2.7 years. The incidence of CA was 5.4% (n = 17), diagnosed after a median time of 10 days after LT. Compared with chylomicron detection in peritoneal fluid (the gold standard), a triglyceride cutoff value of 187 mg/dL in peritoneal fluid showed insufficient sensitivity (31%) for CA diagnosis. In univariate logistic regression analyses, ascites before LT, younger age, and lower weight, height, and height‐for‐age z score at LT were associated with CA. Symptomatic management of CA included peritoneal drain (100%) and diuretics (76%). Therapeutic interventions included very low‐fat or medium‐chain triglyceride–rich diets (94%) and intravenous octreotide (6%), leading to CA resolution in all patients. CA was associated with prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS; 40 days in the CA group versus 24 days in the non‐CA group; P = 0.001) but not with reduced patient or graft survival rates after a median follow‐up time of 14 years. In conclusion, CA in the pediatric LT recipient is a relatively uncommon complication associated with increased hospital LOS and morbidity. Measurement of chylomicrons is recommended in patients with ascites that is more severe or persistent than expected. Dietary interventions are effective in most patients.

A decade of the sharing economy: Concepts, users, business and governance perspectives

Sharing economy platforms have been transforming production and consumption systems in cities around the world. While the sharing economy may contribute to addressing sustainability issues, its actual economic, social and environmental impacts remain poorly understood. Advancing more sustainably promising forms of sharing and leveraging its benefits, while circumventing its pitfalls, is becoming increasingly important in the era of Covid-19 and climate crisis, economic downturn and uncertainty, and loss of social connectedness, particularly in anonymous urban environments. The ways to capitalise on strengths of the sharing economy are still poorly understood. In particular, the roles and perspectives of users, businesses and municipal governments in institutionalising the sharing economy in various geographical contexts are essential to examine. This volume seeks to advance the research field by focusing on four research areas: 1) understanding the sharing economy conceptually; 2) user perspectives on the sharing economy; 3) business perspective on the sharing economy; and 4) urban governance perspective on the sharing economy. The twenty articles in this volume discuss sustainability implications of the sharing economy from different perspectives, in various geographical contexts, and drawing on a range of disciplines. The volume makes a significant contribution by bringing in empirical findings from emerging and developing economies, including Brazil, China, Indonesia, Poland, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, thereby supplementing more frequently discussed perspectives from high-income countries. The volume also outlines the course for future research.

Chapter 2. Surge capacity and infrastructure considerations for mass critical care

PURPOSE: To provide recommendations and standard operating procedures for intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital preparations for a mass disaster or influenza epidemic with a specific focus on surge capacity and infrastructure considerations. METHODS: Based on a literature review and expert opinion, a Delphi process was used to define the essential topics including surge capacity and infrastructure considerations. RESULTS: Key recommendations include: (1) hospitals should increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICU capacity and expanding ICUs into other areas; (2) hospitals should have appropriate beds and monitors for these expansion areas; hospitals should develop contingency plans at the facility and government (local, state, provincial, national) levels to provide additional ventilators; (3) hospitals should develop a phased staffing plan (nursing and physician) for ICUs that provides sufficient patient care supervision during contingency and crisis situations; (4) hospitals should provide expert input to the emergency management personnel at the hospital both during planning for surge capacity as well as during response; (5) hospitals should assure that adequate infrastructure support is present to support critical care activities; (6) hospitals should prioritize locations for expansion by expanding existing ICUs, using postanesthesia care units and emergency departments to capacity, then step-down units, large procedure suites, telemetry units and finally hospital wards. CONCLUSIONS: Judicious planning and adoption of protocols for surge capacity and infrastructure considerations are necessary to optimize outcomes during a pandemic.

Developing Interactive Antimicrobial Stewardship and Infection Prevention Curricula for Diverse Learners: A Tailored Approach

BACKGROUND. To impart principles of antimicrobial stewardship (AS) and infection prevention and control (IPC), we developed a curriculum tailored to the diverse aptitudes of learners at our medical center. METHODS. We integrated case-based modules, group learning activities, smartphone applications (apps), decision support tools, and prescription audit and feedback into curricula of the medical school, medicine residency program, infectious diseases (ID) fellowship program, and hospital medicine program operations. Interventions were implemented in 2012–2016 using a quasi-experimental before-and-after study design, and this was assessed using pre- and postintervention surveys or audit of antibiotic prescriptions. RESULTS. Over 180 medical students participated in the AS and IPC seminars. After smartphone app introduction, 69% reported using the app as their preferred source of antibiotic information. Approximately 70% of students felt comfortable prescribing antibiotics for a known infection compared with 40% at baseline (P = .02), and approximately 83% were able to identify the appropriate personal protective equipment for specific scenarios. Approximately 99% agreed that they have a role in promoting patient safety and preventing healthcare-associated infections as medical students. At 20 months, appropriateness of trainee antibiotic prescriptions increased by 20% (P < .01). Almost all ID fellows indicated that the AS and IPC seminar was a vital training supplement. Uptake of internist antibiotic recommendations using AS decision support tools was approximately 70%. CONCLUSIONS. All 5 interventions addressed learning objectives and knowledge gaps and are applicable across a range of environments. Evaluating long-term impact of our curriculum is the focus of future study.

The prevalence of enteric pathogens in diarrhoeic Thoroughbred foals in Britain and Ireland

A survey of 77 normal and 326 diarrhoeic foals in Britain and Ireland from 1987 to 1989 revealed a significantly higher prevalence of Group A rotaviruses and Aeromonas hydrophila in diarrhoeic foals. The prevalence of cryptosporidia, potentially pathogenic Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica and Clostridium perfringens was similar in normal or diarrhoeic foals. Rotaviruses had a similar prevalence in all age groups of scouring foals up to three months of age, with an overall prevalence of 37 per cent among diarrhoeic foals. The number of cases of diarrhoea varied considerably from year to year, but in all three years of the survey rotavirus was a significant pathogen. A comparison of diagnostic tests for rotavirus in the faeces showed electron microscopy (EM) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) to have similar sensitivity. The Rotazyme ELISA test kit was found to have the same sensitivity as a combination of EM and PAGE. A. hydrophila had an overall prevalence of 9 per cent among diarrhoeic foals, although its prevalence was higher in some age groups. A. hydrophila has not been established previously as a significant enteric pathogen in foals. Other putative pathogens found at very low prevalence were coronavirus, the putative picobirnavirus, Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. No evidence was found of synergistic effects between rotavirus, cryptosporidia and potentially pathogenic E. coli. Neither coccidia nor non‐Group A rotaviruses were found in any of the samples examined.

Interstitial Lung Diseases

The term interstitial lung diseases (ILD) comprises a diverse group of diseases that lead to inflammation and fibrosis of the alveoli, distal airways, and septal interstitium of the lungs. The ILD consist of disorders of known cause (e.g., collagen vascular diseases, drug-related diseases) as well as disorders of unknown etiology. The latter include idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs), and a group of miscellaneous, rare, but nonetheless interesting, diseases. In patients with ILD, MDCT enriches the diagnostic armamentarium by allowing volumetric high-resolution scanning, i.e., continuous data acquisition with thin collimation and a high spatial frequency reconstruction algorithm. CT is a key method in the identification and management of patients with ILD. It not only improves the detection and characterization of parenchymal abnormalities, but also increases the accuracy of diagnosis. The spectrum of morphologic characteristics that are indicative of interstitial lung disease is relatively limited and includes the linear and reticular pattern, the nodular pattern, the increased attenuation pattern (such as ground-glass opacities and consolidation), and the low attenuation pattern (such as emphysema and cystic lung diseases). In the correct clinical context, some patterns or combination of patterns, together with the anatomic distribution of the abnormality, i.e., from the lung apex to the base, or peripheral subpleural versus central bronchovascular, can lead the interpreter to a specific diagnosis. However, due to an overlap of the CT morphology between the various entities, the final diagnosis of many ILD requires close cooperation between clinicians and radiologists and complementary lung biopsy is recommended in many cases.

Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis, weather conditions and air pollution in an Italian urban area: An observational study

Abstract Background In this study we sought to evaluate the association between viral bronchiolitis, weather conditions, and air pollution in an urban area in Italy. Methods We included infants hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis from 2004 to 2014. All infants underwent a nasal washing for virus detection. A regional agency network collected meteorological data (mean temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity) and the following air pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, benzene and suspended particulate matter measuring less than 10 µm (PM10) and less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) in aerodynamic diameter. We obtained mean weekly concentration data for the day of admission, from the urban background monitoring sites nearest to each child's home address. Overdispersed Poisson regression model was fitted and adjusted for seasonality of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, to evaluate the impact of individual characteristics and environmental factors on the probability of a being positive RSV. Results Of the 723 nasal washings from the infants enrolled, 266 (68%) contained RSV, 63 (16.1%) rhinovirus, 26 (6.6%) human bocavirus, 20 (5.1%) human metapneumovirus, and 16 (2.2%) other viruses. The number of RSV-positive infants correlated negatively with temperature (p < 0.001), and positively with relative humidity (p < 0.001). Air pollutant concentrations differed significantly during the peak RSV months and the other months. Benzene concentration was independently associated with RSV incidence (p = 0.0124). Conclusions Seasonal weather conditions and concentration of air pollutants seem to influence RSV-related bronchiolitis epidemics in an Italian urban area.

The effect of corticosteroid treatment on patients with coronavirus infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis

Abstract Objectives An outbreak of novel coronavirus in 2019 threatens the health of people, and there is no proven pharmacological treatment. Although corticosteroids were widely used during outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, their efficacy remainedhighly controversial. We aimed to further evaluate the influence of corticosteroids on patients with coronavirus infection. Methods We conducted a comprehensive search of literature published in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) from January 1, 2002 to March 15, 2020. All statistical analyses in this study were performed on stata14.0. Results A total of 5270 patients from 15 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The result indicated that critical patients were more likely to require corticosteroids therapy (risk ratio [RR] = 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28-1.90, P<0.001). However, corticosteroid treatment was associated with higher mortality (RR = 2.11, 95%CI = 1.13-3.94, P = 0.019), longer length of stay (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 6.31, 95%CI = 5.26–7.37, P<0.001), a higher rate of bacterial infection (RR = 2.08, 95%CI = 1.54–2.81, P<0.001), and hypokalemia (RR = 2.21, 95%CI = 1.07–4.55, P = 0.032) but not hyperglycemia (RR = 1.37, 95%CI=0.68–2.76, P = 0.376) or hypocalcemia (RR = 1.35, 95%CI = 0.77–2.37, P = 0.302). Conclusions Patients with severe conditions are more likely to require corticosteroids. Corticosteroid use is associated with increased mortality in patients with coronavirus pneumonia.

Spatial-temporal variations of atmospheric factors contribute to SARS-CoV-2 outbreak

The global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reached over two million confirmed cases worldwide, and numbers are still growing at a fast rate. The majority of new infections are now being reported outside of China, where the outbreak officially originated in December 2019 in Wuhan. Despite the wide outbreak of the infection, a remarkable asymmetry is observed in the number of cases and in the distribution of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms in patients with respect to the countries/regions. In the early stages of a new pathogen outbreak, it is critical to understand the dynamics of the infection transmission, in order to follow contagion over time and project the epidemiological situation in the near future. While it is possible to reason that observed variation in the number and severity of cases stem from the initial number of infected individuals, the difference in the testing policies and social aspects of community transmissions, the factors that could explain high discrepancy in areas with a similar level of healthcare still remain unknown. Here we introduce a binary classifier based on an artificial neural network that can help in explaining those differences and that can be used to support the design of containment policies. We propose that air pollutants, and specifically particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and ozone, are oppositely related with the SARS-CoV-2 infection frequency and could serve as surrogate markers to complement the infection outbreak anticipation.

Dichloro-Phenyl-Benzotriazoles: A New Selective Class of Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus Entry Inhibitors

Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the primary cause of bronchopneumonia in infants and children worldwide. Clinical studies have shown that early treatments of RSV patients with ribavirin improve prognosis, even if the use of this drug is limited due to myelosuppression and toxicity effects. Furthermore, effective vaccines to prevent RSV infection are currently unavailable. Thus, the development of highly effective and specific antiviral drugs for pre-exposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of RSV infections is a compelling need. In the quest of new RSV inhibitors, in this work we evaluated the antiviral activity of a series of variously substituted 5,6-dichloro-1-phenyl-1(2)H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole derivatives in cell-based assays. Several 1- and 2-phenyl-benzotriazoles resulted fairly potent (μM concentrations) inhibitors of RSV infection in plaque reduction assays, accompanied by low cytotoxicity in human highly dividing T lymphoid-derived cells and primary cell lines. Contextually, no inhibitory effects were observed against other RNA or DNA viruses assayed, suggesting specific activity against RSV. Further results revealed that the lead compound 10d was active during the early phase of the RSV infection cycle. To understand whether 10d interfered with virus attachment to target cells or virus-cell fusion events, inhibitory activity tests against the RSV mutant strain B1 cp-52—expressing only the F envelope glycoprotein—and a plasmid-based reporter assay that quantifies the bioactivity of viral entry were also performed. The overall biological results, in conjunction with in silico modeling studies, supported the conclusion that the RSV fusion process could be the target of this new series of compounds.

Current pharmacological treatments for SARS-COV-2: A narrative review

The novel coronavirus, later identified as SARS-CoV-2, originating from Wuhan in China in November 2019, quickly spread around the world becoming a pandemic. Despite the knowledge of previous coronaviruses, such as those responsible for the SARS and MERS-CoV epidemic, there is no drug or prophylaxis treatment to this day. The rapid succession of scientific findings on SARS-CoV-2 provides a significant number of potential drug targets. Nevertheless, at the same time, the high quantity of clinical data, generated by a large number of rapidly infected people, require accurate tests regarding effective medical treatments. Several in vitro and in vivo studies were rapidly initiated after the outbreak of the pandemic COVID-19. Initial clinical studies revealed the promising potential of remdesivir that demonstrated a powerful and specific in vitro antiviral activity for COVID-19. Promising effects appear to be attributable to hydroxychloroquine. Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine are being tested in ongoing randomized trials. In contrast, oseltamivir was not effective and corticosteroids are not currently recommended. However, few data from ongoing clinical trials are identifying low molecular weight heparins, innate immune system stimulating agents, and inflammatory modulating agents as potential effective agents. The authors assume that the current pandemic will determine the need for a systematic approach based on big data analysis for identifying effective drugs to defeat SARS-Cov-2. This work is aimed to be a general reference point and to provide an overview as comprehensive as possible regarding the main clinical trials in progress at the moment.

Comparison of the outcomes of laparoscopic and open approaches in the treatment of periappendiceal abscess diagnosed by radiologic investigation.

BACKGROUND Although laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) has been performed widely, the role of LA for complicated appendicitis remains controversial, and its role for periappendiceal abscess (PA) remains undefined. This study compared the clinical outcomes of LA and open appendectomy (OA) for PA diagnosed by radiologic investigation. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of 84 patients who underwent surgery for PA diagnosed by radiologic investigation between 2010 and 2013. Twenty-five patients underwent LA, and the remaining patients underwent OA. Patient characteristics, operative outcomes, and surgical complications were compared between the two groups. RESULTS Three patients required conversion from LA to OA (12%). There were no significant differences in the overall complication (28% versus 25.4%; P=.8), wound infection (15.3% versus 4%; P=.27), stump leakage (4% versus 1.7%; P=.51), and postoperative ileus (4% versus 8.5%; P=.66) rates between the groups. The incidence of intraabdominal abscess (IAA) was significantly higher in the LA group (20% versus 3.4%; P=.02). In multivariate analysis, the risk factors for IAA were duration of drainage (P=.04) and type of operation (P=.006). The major complications rate was 2.4% in the total cohort, and the rate was significantly higher in the LA group (8% versus 0%; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS For patients with PA, the rates of overall complications, wound infection, stump leakage, and postoperative ileus were similar for both procedures. However, LA resulted in a significantly higher incidence of IAA and major complications than OA.

Addressing inequities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality: research and policy recommendations

The COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest global public health crisis since the 1918 influenza outbreak. As of early June, the novel coronavirus has infected more than 6.3 million people worldwide and more than 1.9 million in the United States (US). The total number of recorded deaths due to COVID-19 are growing at an alarming rate globally (³383,000) and nationally (³109,000) Evidence is mounting regarding the heavier burden of COVID-19 infection, morbidity, and mortality on the underserved populations in the US. This commentary focuses on this global health pandemic and how mitigation of the virus relies heavily on health behavior change to slow its spread, highlighting how the pandemic specifically affects the most socially and economically disadvantaged populations in the US. The commentary also offers short, intermediate and long-term research and policy focused recommendations. Both the research and policy recommendations included in this commentary emphasize equity-driven: (1) research practices, including applying a social determinants and health equity lens on monitoring, evaluation, and clinical trials activities on COVID-19; and (2) policy actions, such as dedicating resources to prioritize high-risk communities for testing, treatment, and prevention approaches and implementing organizational, institutional, and legislative policies that address the social and economic barriers to overall well-being that these populations face during a pandemic. It is our hope that these recommendations will generate momentum in delivering timely, effective, and lifesaving changes.

Prevalence of Intracranial Aneurysms in Patients with Connective Tissue Diseases: A Retrospective Study.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Few studies have examined the prevalence of intracranial aneurysms in connective tissue diseases such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. We studied the prevalence of intracranial aneurysms and other intracranial neurovascular pathologies such as arteriovenous malformations and intracranial dissections, in these 4 patient populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all patients who had a clinical diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, or Loeys-Dietz syndrome who underwent MRA, CTA, and/or DSA imaging of the intracranial circulation between January 1, 2005, and January 31, 2015. The presence, location, and maximum dimensions of intracranial aneurysms were catalogued. Other neurovascular findings studied included intracranial dissections and arteriovenous fistulas and shunts. Baseline data collected included demographic characteristics (sex, age, smoking history), imaging modality, and cardiovascular comorbidities. RESULTS The prevalence of intracranial saccular and fusiform aneurysms was as follows: 14% (8/59) among patients with Marfan syndrome, 12% (12/99) among patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, 11% (5/47) among patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, and 28% (7/25) among patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Intracranial dissections were found in 2 patients (3%) with Marfan syndrome and 1 patient (1%) with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. No intracranial dissections were found in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 or Loeys-Dietz syndrome. CONCLUSIONS Patients with connective tissue disorders, including Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome, have a high prevalence of intracranial aneurysms.

Incidence of asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and elevated D-dimer levels

AIM: An increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) has been reported. Whether COVID-19 increases the risk of VTE in non-ICU wards remains unknown. We aimed to evaluate the burden of asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in COVID-19 patients with elevated D-dimer levels. METHOD: In this prospective study consecutive patients hospitalized in non-intensive care units with diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and D-dimerâ¯>â¯1000â¯ng/ml were screened for asymptomatic DVT with complete compression doppler ultrasound (CCUS). The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. RESULTS: The study comprised 156 patients (65.4% male). All but three patients received standard doses of thromboprophylaxis. Median days of hospitalization until CCUS was 9 (IQR 5-17). CCUS was positive for DVT in 23 patients (14.7%), of whom only one was proximal DVT. Seven patients (4.5%) had bilateral distal DVT. Patients with DVT had higher median D-dimer levels: 4527 (IQR 1925-9144) ng/ml vs 2050 (IQR 1428-3235) ng/ml; pâ¯<â¯0.001. D-dimer levelsâ¯>â¯1570â¯ng/ml were associated with asymptomatic DVT (OR 9.1; CI 95% 1.1-70.1). D-dimer showed an acceptable discriminative capacity (area under the ROC curve 0.72, 95% CI 0.61-0.84). CONCLUSION: In patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia and elevated D-dimer levels, the incidence of asymptomatic DVT is similar to that described in other series. Higher cut-off levels for D-dimer might be necessary for the diagnosis of DVT in COVID-19 patients.

Acute effects of insulin on circulating natriuretic peptide levels in humans.

BACKGROUND The natriuretic peptide hormones play an important role in salt and blood pressure regulation. In observational studies, obesity and insulin resistance have been consistently associated with lower concentrations of natriuretic peptides. It has been proposed that insulin influences natriuretic peptide production. OBJECTIVE We sought to determine the acute effects of insulin administration on natriuretic peptide concentrations. METHODS 31 men and women (11 lean, 10 overweight, and 10 obese), ages 30-70 years, without cardiovascular disease or overt diabetes underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic insulin clamp. Plasma concentrations of N-terminal pro atrial natriuretic peptide (NT-proANP) and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were measured at baseline and steady-state (the final 30 minutes of the clamp protocol). RESULTS From baseline to steady-state, insulin levels increased from a mean level of 9.5 to 176.7 μU/ml (p<0.001). Over this period, circulating NT-proANP concentrations decreased by 9% (-1933 ng/L, p = 0.01). The changes in NT-proANP did not differ between lean, overweight, and obese individuals. Steady-state NT-proANP levels, adjusted for baseline, were lower in individuals with greater insulin resistance, independent of BMI. In contrast to NT-proANP, NT-proBNP levels did not change significantly during the clamp (p = 0.41). CONCLUSION Insulin administration was associated with a moderate decrease in circulating NT-proANP, but not NT-proBNP. The lowest NT-proANP concentrations were found in insulin-resistant individuals. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate potential mechanisms underlying the effects of insulin on the cardiac hormonal axis.

Biosafety Recommendations on the Handling of Animal Cell Cultures

The first steps in tissue culture are dating back to the beginning of the nineteenth century when biosafety measures did not yet exist. Later on, animal cell culture became essential for scientific research, diagnosis and biotechnological activities. Along with this development, biosafety concerns have emerged pointing to the risks for human health and in a lesser extent for the environment associated to the handling of animal cell cultures. The management of these risks requires a thorough risk assessment of both the cell cultures and the type of manipulation prior the start of any activity. It involves a case-by-case evaluation of both the intrinsic properties of the cell culture genetically modified or not and the probability that it may inadvertently or intentionally become infected with pathogenic micro-organisms. The latter hazard is predominant when adventitious contaminants are pathogenic or have a better capacity to persist in unfavourable conditions. Consequently, most of the containment measures primarily aim at protecting cells from adventitious contamination. Cell cultures known to harbour an infectious etiologic agent should be manipulated in compliance with containment measures recommended for the etiologic agent itself. The manipulation of cell cultures from human or primate origin necessitates the use of a type II biosafety cabinet. The scope of this chapter is to highlight aspects relevant for the risk assessment and to summarize the main biosafety recommendations and the recent technological advances allowing a mitigation of the risk for the handling of animal cell cultures.

Spatiotemporal Characteristics of COVID-19 Epidemic in the United States

BACKGROUND: A range of near-real-time online/mobile mapping dashboards and applications have been used to track the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. It remains unknown about small area-based spatiotemporal patterns of COVID-19 in the United States. METHODS: We obtained county-based counts of COVID-19 cases confirmed in the United States from January 22 to May 13, 2020 (N=1,386,050). We characterized the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic through detecting weekly hotspots of newly confirmed cases using Spatial and Space-Time Scan Statistics and quantifying the trends of incidence of COVID-19 by county characteristics using the Joinpoint analysis. RESULTS: Along with the national plateau reached in early April, COVID-19 incidence significantly decreased in the Northeast (estimated weekly percentage changes [EWPC]: -16.6%), but remained increasing in the Midwest, South and West Regions (EWPCs: 13.2%, 5.6%, and 5.7%, respectively). Higher risks of clustering and incidence of COVID-19 were consistently observed in metropolitan vs rural counties, counties closest to core airports, most populous counties, and counties with highest proportion of racial/ethnic minority counties. However, geographic differences in the incidence have shrunk since early April, driven by a significant decrease in the incidence in these counties (EWPC range: -2.0% - -4.2%) and a consistent increase in other areas (EWPC range: 1.5% - 20.3%). CONCLUSIONS: To substantially decrease the nationwide incidence of COVID-19, strict social distancing measures should be continuously implemented, especially in geographic areas with increasing risks, including rural areas. Spatiotemporal characteristics and trends of COVID-19 should be considered in decision-making on the timeline of re-opening for states and localities.

Drug Repurposing to find Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently there is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 and so, there is an urgent need for expedite discovery of new therapeutics to combat the disease until a vaccine will be available worldwide. Drug repurposing is a strategy for identifying new uses for approved drugs that has the advantage (over conventional approaches that attempt to develop a drug from scratch) that time frame of the overall process can be significantly reduced because of the few number of clinical trial required. In this work, a virtual screening of FDA-approved drugs was performed for repositioning as potential inhibitors of the main protease Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. As a result of this study, 12 drugs are proposed as candidates for inhibitors of the Mpro enzyme. Some of the selected compounds are antiviral drugs that are already being tested in COVID-19 clinical trials (i.e. ribavirin) or are used to alleviate symptoms of the disease (i.e. codeine). Surprisingly, the most promising candidate is the naturally occurring broad spectrum antibiotic oxytetracycline. This compound has largely outperformed the remaining selected candidates along all filtering steps of our virtual screening protocol. If the activity of any of these drugs is experimentally corroborated, they could be used directly in clinical trials without the need for pre-clinical testing or safety evaluation since they are already used as drugs for other diseases.

Outbreak of neonatal diarrhea in farmed mink kits (Mustella vison) associated with enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus delphini.

An outbreak of diarrhea on a large commercial mink farm affected 5,000 of 36,000 neonatal mink kits, with 2,000 dying within a 2-week period. Affected kits were severely dehydrated, and their furcoats and paws were covered with yellow- to green-tinged mucoid feces. On necropsy, the small intestines of examined animals were markedly distended by serous to mucoid fluid. Microscopically, there was prominent colonization of the intestinal villar epithelium by gram-positive bacterial cocci in the absence of inflammation and morphologic changes in villous enterocytes. The colonizing bacteria were phenotypically identified as belonging to the Staphylococcus intermedius group of bacteria. This was confirmed by nucleic acid sequence analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Further nucleic acid sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons from the superoxide dismutase gene and the heat shock protein 60 gene differentiated the isolate as Staphylococcus delphini. Production of staphylococcal enterotoxins A and E was demonstrated with a commercial ELISA-based immunoassay. Sequencing of PCR amplicons confirmed the presence of the enterotoxin E gene, but PCR amplification of the enterotoxin A, B, C, or D genes was not successful. Although direct causation was not confirmed in this study, the authors postulate that the observed hypersecretory diarrhea in these mink kits was the result of colonization of the small intestine by S delphini and subsequent production of enterotoxin.

Implications of asymptomatic carriers for infectious disease transmission and control

For infectious pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, some hosts may carry the pathogen and transmit it to others, yet display no symptoms themselves. These asymptomatic carriers contribute to the spread of disease but go largely undetected and can therefore undermine efforts to control transmission. Understanding the natural history of carriage and its relationship to disease is important for the design of effective interventions to control transmission. Mathematical models of infectious diseases are frequently used to inform decisions about control and should therefore accurately capture the role played by asymptomatic carriers. In practice, incorporating asymptomatic carriers into models is challenging due to the sparsity of direct evidence. This absence of data leads to uncertainty in estimates of model parameters and, more fundamentally, in the selection of an appropriate model structure. To assess the implications of this uncertainty, we systematically reviewed published models of carriage and propose a new model of disease transmission with asymptomatic carriage. Analysis of our model shows how different assumptions about the role of asymptomatic carriers can lead to different conclusions about the transmission and control of disease. Critically, selecting an inappropriate model structure, even when parameters are correctly estimated, may lead to over- or under-estimates of intervention effectiveness. Our results provide a more complete understanding of the role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission and highlight the importance of accurately incorporating carriers into models used to make decisions about disease control.

Patients With Cancer and COVID-19: A WhatsApp Messenger-Based Survey of Patients’ Queries, Needs, Fears, and Actions Taken

PURPOSE: This descriptive investigation was undertaken at three oncology units to report queries, needs, and fears related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) of patients with cancer and to avoid uncontrolled treatment delays or withdrawal, behavioral mistakes, and panic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All queries spontaneously delivered through the WhatsApp instant messaging system commonly used by patients to communicate with oncology units were collected and grouped by homology in five categories. Responses to the queries were given according to recommendations by the Italian Association of Medical Oncology through WhatsApp and by subsequent phone calls. Patients were also classified according to the site of the primary tumor, stage of disease, and current treatments. Analysis of the association between these data and queries was carried out. RESULTS: The social scenario in Italy is a nationwide lockdown except for hospitals, pharmacies, and food supplies. Overall, 446 different patients’ WhatsApp conversations were analyzed between March 1 and March 13 and comprised the following: requirement of visit delay by patients undergoing oral therapies or in follow-up, delays in chemotherapy or immunotherapy administration, queries about possible immunosuppression, and changes in lifestyle or daily activities. Delay requirements were statistically more frequent among patients with prostate or breast cancer compared with those with lung or pancreatic cancer. Actions taken by oncologists are also reported. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, the WhatsApp instant messaging system has been occasionally used in other medical settings with controversial results. In our experience, WhatsApp turned out to be adequate to give a rapid answer to most queries from patients with cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic scenario.

Endovascular treatment of middle cerebral artery aneurysms with flow modification with the use of the pipeline embolization device.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The Pipeline Embolization Device was reported to be safe and effective in the treatment of sidewall aneurysms, preserving the patency of the vessels covered by the construct. However, to date, the safety and efficacy of this device in treating bifurcation aneurysms remains unknown. We report our preliminary experience with the use of the Pipeline Embolization Device in the management of MCA aneurysms located at the bifurcations, including mid- and long-term follow-up data. MATERIALS AND METHODS Wide-neck MCA aneurysms, which give rise to a bifurcating or distal branch in which other endovascular techniques are thought to be unfeasible or more risky, were included. Data including demographics, aneurysm features, antiplatelet therapy, complications, and angiographic follow-up results for up to 30 months were recorded. RESULTS Twenty-five aneurysms located at the MCA bifurcation (n = 21) or distal (n = 4) were treated. Of these, 22 were small and 3 were large. A single device was used in all but 2. No deaths occurred in the series. All patients had at least 1 control angiographic study, 21 of which were DSA (3-30 months), which showed that 12 of the rising branches were patent whereas 6 were filling in reduced caliber and 3 were occluded asymptomatically. According to the last angiographic follow-up, complete occlusion was revealed in 21 of 25 aneurysms (84%). CONCLUSIONS The Pipeline Embolization Device provides a safe and effective treatment alternative for wide-neck MCA aneurysms that give rise to a bifurcating or distal branch when other endovascular techniques are thought to be unfeasible or more risky.

Handling Stress and Sample Storage Are Associated with Weaker Complement-Mediated Bactericidal Ability in Birds but Not Bats.

Variation in immune defense influences infectious disease dynamics within and among species. Understanding how variation in immunity drives pathogen transmission among species is especially important for animals that are reservoir hosts for zoonotic pathogens. Bats, in particular, have a propensity to host serious viral zoonoses without developing clinical disease themselves. The immunological adaptations that allow bats to host viruses without disease may be related to their adaptations for flight (e.g., in metabolism and mediation of oxidative stress). A number of analyses report greater richness of zoonotic pathogens in bats than in other taxa, such as birds (i.e., mostly volant vertebrates) and rodents (i.e., nonvolant small mammals), but immunological comparisons between bats and these other taxa are rare. To examine interspecific differences in bacterial killing ability (BKA), a functional measure of overall constitutive innate immunity, we use a phylogenetic meta-analysis to compare how BKA responds to the acute stress of capture and to storage time of frozen samples across the orders Aves and Chiroptera. After adjusting for host phylogeny, sample size, and total microbe colony-forming units, we find preliminary evidence that the constitutive innate immune defense of bats may be more resilient to handling stress and storage time than that of birds. This pattern was also similar when we analyzed the proportion of nonnegative and positive effect sizes per species, using phylogenetic comparative methods. We discuss potential physiological and evolutionary mechanisms by which complement proteins may differ between species orders and suggest future avenues for comparative field studies of immunity between sympatric bats, birds, and rodents in particular.

Assessing Eating Behaviour Using Upper Limb Mounted Motion Sensors: A Systematic Review.

Wearable motion tracking sensors are now widely used to monitor physical activity, and have recently gained more attention in dietary monitoring research. The aim of this review is to synthesise research to date that utilises upper limb motion tracking sensors, either individually or in combination with other technologies (e.g., cameras, microphones), to objectively assess eating behaviour. Eleven electronic databases were searched in January 2019, and 653 distinct records were obtained. Including 10 studies found in backward and forward searches, a total of 69 studies met the inclusion criteria, with 28 published since 2017. Fifty studies were conducted exclusively in laboratory settings, 13 exclusively in free-living settings, and three in both settings. The most commonly used motion sensor was an accelerometer (64) worn on the wrist (60) or lower arm (5), while in most studies (45), accelerometers were used in combination with gyroscopes. Twenty-six studies used commercial-grade smartwatches or fitness bands, 11 used professional grade devices, and 32 used standalone sensor chipsets. The most used machine learning approaches were Support Vector Machine (SVM, n = 21), Random Forest (n = 19), Decision Tree (n = 16), Hidden Markov Model (HMM, n = 10) algorithms, and from 2017 Deep Learning (n = 5). While comparisons of the detection models are not valid due to the use of different datasets, the models that consider the sequential context of data across time, such as HMM and Deep Learning, show promising results for eating activity detection. We discuss opportunities for future research and emerging applications in the context of dietary assessment and monitoring.

GPI-anchored single chain Fv - an effective way to capture transiently-exposed neutralization epitopes on HIV-1 envelope spike

BACKGROUND: Identification of broad neutralization epitopes in HIV-1 envelope spikes is paramount for HIV-1 vaccine development. A few broad neutralization epitopes identified so far are present on the surface of native HIV-1 envelope spikes whose recognition by antibodies does not depend on conformational changes of the envelope spikes. However, HIV-1 envelope spikes also contain transiently-exposed neutralization epitopes, which are more difficult to identify. RESULTS: In this study, we constructed single chain Fvs (scFvs) derived from seven human monoclonal antibodies and genetically linked them with or without a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) attachment signal. We show that with a GPI attachment signal the scFvs are targeted to lipid rafts of plasma membranes. In addition, we demonstrate that four of the GPI-anchored scFvs, but not their secreted counterparts, neutralize HIV-1 with various degrees of breadth and potency. Among them, GPI-anchored scFv (X5) exhibits extremely potent and broad neutralization activity against multiple clades of HIV-1 strains tested. Moreover, we show that GPI-anchored scFv (4E10) also exhibited more potent neutralization activity than its secretory counterpart. Finally, we demonstrate that expression of GPI-anchored scFv (X5) in the lipid raft of plasma membrane of human CD4(+ )T cells confers long-term resistance to HIV-1 infection, HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion, and the infection of HIV-1 captured and transferred by human DCs. CONCLUSIONS: Thus GPI-anchored scFv could be used as a general and effective way to identify antibodies that react with transiently-exposed neutralization epitopes in envelope proteins of HIV-1 and other enveloped viruses. The GPI-anchored scFv (X5), because of its breadth and potency, should have a great potential to be developed into anti-viral agent for HIV-1 prevention and therapy.

The Impact of Infectious Diseases on the Development of Africa

Despite the success of vaccination programs for polio and some childhood diseases, other diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, acute respiratory infections and diarrheal disease are causing high mortality rates in Africa. However, mortality figures give only a partial measure of the toll asked by infectious diseases, and the global burden includes also health impact measured by disabilities, deformities, loss of productivity, care and treatment caused by a multitude of diseases like lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, sleeping sickness and others. The impact of infectious diseases can be traced according to economic performance of African countries, showing that 34 out of 53 countries are classified as low-income economies. The disease burden is, however, more devastating since it affects all components of human development, including income, health and education. The impact of infectious diseases on African countries is no longer a crisis only for the healthcare sector, but presents a challenge to all sectors. It has the potential to reverse those gains made in human development in the last few years. Consequently, beyond health issues, these diseases should and must globally be seen as a development concern, affecting education and knowledge acquisition, income and social status, productivity and economic growth and other direct and indirect components of human development such as gender equality and human rights. For health strategies to be successful, international solidarity and public-private partnerships are needed to tackle the problems of shortage and lack of treatments, resistance and the need for new drugs, vaccines and diagnostic procedures. However, the output of international initiatives will remain limited without the national and local implication.

[COVID-19 in the Emergency Department of Bernhoven hospital].

OBJECTIVE To describe disease presentation and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) of Bernhoven hospital in Uden, the Netherlands. DESIGN Prospective, descriptive study. METHOD The registry focused on atypical symptoms and co-infections. We hypothesized that patients older than 70 years more often have atypical symptoms. The number of co-infections is unknown. Therefore, we prospectively registered medical history, duration of symptoms, symptoms, temperature, lab results and co-infections of patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the period March 4-16th. RESULTS The clinical characteristics of 107 patients were registered. The average age was 71 years and 41% was female. The median duration of symptoms was 5 days. 19% of patients had not been referred to pulmonary or internal medicine. Symptoms were fever (78%), respiratory complaints (78%), chest pain (28%), abdominal pain (13%), and diarrhea (34%). In 54% of the COVID-19 patients at the ED, the temperature was ≥ 38,0°C, CRP ≥ 50 in 51%, leucocytosis in 12% and elevated LD in 61%. Of 31 patients 24 (77%) had an absolute lymphopenia. Co-infections were seen in 16% of patients. The mortality in the ED was 2% and ICU-admission 5%. On March 25th, 2020 the overall mortality was 22% and ICU-admission 15%. CONCLUSION We have seen patients with a very serious disease resulting in a high mortality and ICU-admission. Over 35% of patient did not have the typical symptoms of fever and respiratory complaints; atypical symptoms like chest pain, abdominal pain and diarrhea are frequently seen. There is no difference between patients over and under 70 years. COVID-19 patients can present with atypical symptoms, co-infections and distributed over various medical specialties.

Laparoscopic versus open surgery for rectal cancer: long-term oncologic results.

OBJECTIVE The goal was to assess long-term oncologic outcome after laparoscopic versus open surgery for rectal cancer and to evaluate the impact of conversion. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Laparoscopic resection of rectal cancer is technically feasible, but there are no data to evaluate the long-term outcome between laparoscopic and open approach. Moreover, the long-term impact of conversion is not known. METHODS Between 1994 and 2006, patients treated by open (1994-1999) and laparoscopic (2000-2006) curative resection for rectal cancer were included in a retrospective comparative study. Patients with fixed tumors or metastatic disease were excluded. Those with T3-T4 or N+ disease received long course preoperative radiotherapy. Surgical technique and follow-up were standardized. Survival were analyzed by Kaplan Meier method and compared with the Log Rank test. RESULTS Some 471 patients had rectal excision for invasive rectal carcinoma: 238 were treated by laparoscopy and 233 by open procedure. Postoperative mortality (0.8% vs. 2.6%; P = 0.17), morbidity (22.7% vs. 20.2%; P = 0.51), and quality of surgery (92.0% vs. 94.8% R0 resection; P = 0.22) were similar in the 2 groups. At 5 years, there was no difference of local recurrence (3.9% vs. 5.5%; P = 0.371) and cancer-free survival (82% vs. 79%; P = 0.52) between laparoscopic and open surgery. Multivariate analysis confirmed that type of surgery did not influence cancer outcome. Conversion (36/238, 15%) had no negative impact on postoperative mortality, local recurrence, and survival. CONCLUSIONS The efficacy of laparoscopic surgery in a team specialized in rectal excision for cancer (open and laparoscopic surgery) is suggested with similar long-term local control and cancer-free survival than open surgery. Moreover, conversion had no negative impact on survival.

Employees recruitment: A prescriptive analytics approach via machine learning and mathematical programming

In this paper, we propose a comprehensive analytics framework that can serve as a decision support tool for HR recruiters in real-world settings in order to improve hiring and placement decisions. The proposed framework follows two main phases: a local prediction scheme for recruitments' success at the level of a single job placement, and a mathematical model that provides a global recruitment optimization scheme for the organization, taking into account multilevel considerations. In the first phase, a key property of the proposed prediction approach is the interpretability of the machine learning (ML) model, which in this case is obtained by applying the Variable-Order Bayesian Network (VOBN) model to the recruitment data. Specifically, we used a uniquely large dataset that contains recruitment records of hundreds of thousands of employees over a decade and represents a wide range of heterogeneous populations. Our analysis shows that the VOBN model can provide both high accuracy and interpretability insights to HR professionals. Moreover, we show that using the interpretable VOBN can lead to unexpected and sometimes counter-intuitive insights that might otherwise be overlooked by recruiters who rely on conventional methods. We demonstrate that it is feasible to predict the successful placement of a candidate in a specific position at a pre-hire stage and utilize predictions to devise a global optimization model. Our results show that in comparison to actual recruitment decisions, the devised framework is capable of providing a balanced recruitment plan while improving both diversity and recruitment success rates, despite the inherent trade-off between the two.

Single-incision vs straight laparoscopic segmental colectomy: a case-controlled study.

PURPOSE Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is gaining momentum in general surgery but it is essentially unstudied for laparoscopic colectomy. The aim of our study was to compare outcomes for single-incision laparoscopic colectomy with laparoscopic-assisted colectomy. METHODS Patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy were prospectively entered into an institutional review board-approved database. Those that underwent single-incision laparoscopic colectomy were case matched for sex, age, disease, surgery, body mass index, previous surgeries, and surgeon with patients undergoing LAC. RESULTS Twenty-nine single-incision laparoscopic segmental colectomies were performed for polyps (4), adenocarcinoma (12), diverticulitis (6), and Crohn's disease (7) and were case matched to laparoscopic-assisted colectomy for the same indications. Mean body mass index was 28.8 ± 3 kg/m². Operative time was longer for single-incision laparoscopic colectomy (134.4 ± 40 vs 103.8 ± 54 min; P = .0002). Four single-incision laparoscopic colectomies were converted to LAC requiring either one extra port (2) or 2 extra ports (2), and there was one conversion to laparotomy. Extraction scar length (millimeters) was similar (38 ± 6.0 vs 45 ± 6.2; P = .746). Postoperative morbidity (5/29 vs 7/29; P = .284) and length of stay (day) (3.7 ± 1.1 vs 3.9 ± 1.1; P = .445) were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy is feasible and safe but takes more time than laparoscopic-assisted colectomy. Although results approximate those for laparoscopic-assisted colectomy, an additional learning curve is involved, and extra incisions are sometimes required. Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy requires further prospective validation so that the cost of the device can be justified by an improved clinical outcome.

Characterization of a Large Panel of Lactic Acid Bacteria Derived from the Human Gut for their Capacity to Polarize Dendritic Cell

Dendritic cells (DCs) are the principal stimulators of naïve T helper (Th) cells and play a pivotal regulatory role in the Th1, Th2 and Treg cell balance. DCs are present in the gut mucosa and may thus be target for modulation by gut microbes, including ingested probiotics. Here, we tested the hypothesis that species of lactic acid bacteria, important members of the gut flora, differentially activate DC. A large panel of human gut‐derived Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp. was screened for DC‐polarizing capacity by exposing bone marrow‐derived murine DC to lethally irradiated bacteria. Cytokines in culture supernatants and DC‐surface maturation markers were analysed. Substantial differences were found among strains in the capacity to induce interleukin‐12 (IL‐12) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)‐α, while the differences for IL‐10 and IL‐6 were less pronounced. Bifidobacteria tended to be weak IL‐12 and TNF‐α inducers, while both strong and weak IL‐12 inducers were found among the strains of Lactobacillus. Remarkably, strains weak in IL‐12 induction inhibited IL‐12 and TNF‐α production induced by an otherwise strong cytokine‐inducing strain of Lactobacillus casei, while IL‐10 production remained unaltered. Selected strains were tested for induction of DC maturation markers. Those lactobacilli with greatest capacity to induce IL‐12 were most effective in upregulating surface MHC class II and CD86. Moreover, L. casei‐induced upregulation of CD86 was reduced in the presence of a weak IL‐12‐inducing L. reuteri. In conclusion, human Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp. polarize differentially DC maturation. Thus, the potential exists for Th1/Th2/Treg‐driving capacities of the gut DC to be modulated according to composition of gut flora including ingested probiotics.

Can pioglitazone be potentially useful therapeutically in treating patients with COVID-19?

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic disease (COVID-19) that has spread globally causing more than 30,000 deaths. Despite the immense and ongoing global effort, no efficacious drugs to fight this plague have been identified and patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU), for respiratory distress, are managed mostly by means of supportive care based on oxygen maintenance. Several authors have reported that the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases comorbidities were indeed frequent among patients with COVID-19, which suggests that these conditions are likely to aggravate and complicate the prognosis. What the aforementioned diseases have in common is a latent chronic inflammatory state that may be associated with the alteration of laboratory parameters that are typical of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. In severe COVID-19 patients laboratory markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, D-dimer, serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase are elevated in many patients; assessed since the 4th-6th day of illness onset, such increases seem to be predictive of an adverse prognosis. Our hypothesis is that drugs belonging to the family of thiazolidinediones (TZD) such as pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, approved for treating the condition of insulin resistance and the accompanying inflammation, could ameliorate the prognosis of those COVID-19 patients with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disorders comorbidities. TZD are PPARÎ³ agonists that act on nuclear receptors, thereby triggering certain transcription factors. TZD were widely used for type-2 diabetes in the first decade of this century and although concerns have been raised for possible side effects associated with long-term treatment, their use has been recently revaluated for their anti-inflammatory properties in numerous medical conditions.

Recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing the spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus induces protective neutralizing antibodies primarily targeting the receptor binding region.

Immunization with a killed or inactivated viral vaccine provides significant protection in animals against challenge with certain corresponding pathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs). However, the promise of this approach in humans is hampered by serious concerns over the risk of leaking live severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viruses. In this study, we generated a SARS vaccine candidate by using the live-attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) as a vector. The full-length SARS-CoV envelope Spike (S) glycoprotein gene was introduced into the deletion III region of the MVA genome. The newly generated recombinant MVA, ADS-MVA, is replication incompetent in mammalian cells and highly immunogenic in terms of inducing potent neutralizing antibodies in mice, rabbits, and monkeys. After two intramuscular vaccinations with ADS-MVA alone, the 50% inhibitory concentration in serum was achieved with reciprocal sera dilutions of more than 1,000- to 10,000-fold in these animals. Using fragmented S genes as immunogens, we also mapped a neutralizing epitope in the region of N-terminal 400 to 600 amino acids of the S glycoprotein (S400-600), which overlaps with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-binding region (RBR; S318-510). Moreover, using a recombinant soluble RBR-Fc protein, we were able to absorb and remove the majority of the neutralizing antibodies despite observing that the full S protein tends to induce a broader spectrum of neutralizing activities in comparison with fragmented S proteins. Our data suggest that a major mechanism for neutralizing SARS-CoV likely occurs through blocking the interaction between virus and the cellular receptor ACE2. In addition, ADS-MVA induced potent immune responses which very likely protected Chinese rhesus monkeys from pathogenic SARS-CoV challenge.

Protective effect of sildenafil on the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice bone marrow cells

BACKGROUND: The pharmacological inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), sildenafil, is a promising candidate for antioxidant therapy that can result in cardiovascular protection. In addition to its known effects on the cardiovascular system, hypercholesterolemia leads to increased oxidative stress and DNA damage in the bone marrow, which is a non-classical target organ of atherosclerosis. In the present study, we evaluate oxidative stress and assess the effect of genomic instability on cell cycle kinetics in atherosclerotic animals and determine if sildenafil reverses these detrimental effects in bone marrow cells. METHODS: Experiments were performed in male wild-type (WT) and apolipoprotein E knockout mice (apoE(−/−)) (9 weeks of age). apoE(−/−) mice were randomly distributed into the following 2 groups: sildenafil-treated (40 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks, n = 8) and vehicle-treated (n = 8), by oral gavage. After treatment, bone marrow cells were isolated to assess the production of superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide, determine cell cycle kinetics and evaluate the presence of micronucleated cells. RESULTS: Sildenafil treatment reduced the cytoplasmic levels of superoxide anion (~95 % decrease, p < 0.05) and decreased hydrogen peroxide (~30 % decrease, p < 0.05). Moreover, we observed protective effects on the DNA of bone marrow cells, including normal cell cycling, decreased DNA fragmentation and a diminished frequency of micronucleated cells. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal that the excessive production of ROS in atherosclerotic mice overcome the DNA repair pathways in bone marrow cells. The novelty of the present study is that the administration of sildenafil reduced ROS to baseline levels and, consequently, reverted the DNA damage and its outcomes in bone marrow cells.

Emerging pharmacological therapies for ARDS: COVID-19 and beyond

ARDS, first described in 1967, is the commonest form of acute severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. Despite considerable advances in our knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of ARDS, insights into the biologic mechanisms of lung injury and repair, and advances in supportive care, particularly ventilatory management, there remains no effective pharmacological therapy for this syndrome. Hospital mortality at 40% remains unacceptably high underlining the need to continue to develop and test therapies for this devastating clinical condition. The purpose of the review is to critically appraise the current status of promising emerging pharmacological therapies for patients with ARDS and potential impact of these and other emerging therapies for COVID-19-induced ARDS. We focus on drugs that: (1) modulate the immune response, both via pleiotropic mechanisms and via specific pathway blockade effects, (2) modify epithelial and channel function, (3) target endothelial and vascular dysfunction, (4) have anticoagulant effects, and (5) enhance ARDS resolution. We also critically assess drugs that demonstrate potential in emerging reports from clinical studies in patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS. Several therapies show promise in earlier and later phase clinical testing, while a growing pipeline of therapies is in preclinical testing. The history of unsuccessful clinical trials of promising therapies underlines the challenges to successful translation. Given this, attention has been focused on the potential to identify biologically homogenous subtypes within ARDS, to enable us to target more specific therapies ‘precision medicines.’ It is hoped that the substantial number of studies globally investigating potential therapies for COVID-19 will lead to the rapid identification of effective therapies to reduce the mortality and morbidity of this devastating form of ARDS.

A Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of the COVID–19 Pandemic Model

Global efforts around the world are focused on to discuss several health care strategies for minimizing the impact of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) on the community. As it is clear that this virus becomes a public health threat and spreading easily among individuals. Mathematical models with computational simulations are effective tools that help global efforts to estimate key transmission parameters and further improvements for controlling this disease. This is an infectious disease and can be modeled as a system of non-linear differential equations with reaction rates. This work reviews and develops some suggested models for the COVID-19 that can address important questions about global health care and suggest important notes. Then, we suggest an updated model that includes a system of differential equations with transmission parameters. Some key computational simulations and sensitivity analysis are investigated. Also, the local sensitivities for each model state concerning the model parameters are computed using three different techniques: non-normalizations, half normalizations, and full normalizations. Results based on the computational simulations show that the model dynamics are significantly changed for different key model parameters. Interestingly, we identify that transition rates between asymptomatic infected with both reported and unreported symptomatic infected individuals are very sensitive parameters concerning model variables in spreading this disease. This helps international efforts to reduce the number of infected individuals from the disease and to prevent the propagation of new coronavirus more widely on the community. Another novelty of this paper is the identification of the critical model parameters, which makes it easy to be used by biologists with less knowledge of mathematical modeling and also facilitates the improvement of the model for future development theoretically and practically.

Finding disease modules for cancer and COVID-19 in gene co-expression networks with the Core&Peel method

Diseases imply dysregulation of cell’s functions at several levels. The study of differentially expressed genes in case-control cohorts of patients is often the first step in understanding the details of the cell’s dysregulation. A further level of analysis is introduced by noticing that genes are organized in functional modules (often called pathways), thus their action and their dysregulation may be better understood by the identification of the modules most affected by the disease (aka disease modules, or active subnetworks). We describe how an algorithm based on the Core&Peel method developed originally for detecting protein complexes in PPI networks, can be adapted to detect disease modules in co-expression networks of genes. We first validate Core&Peel for the easier general task of functional module detection by comparison with 42 methods participating in the Disease Module Identification DREAM challenge of 2019. Next, we use four specific disease test cases (colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, asthma and rheumatoid arthritis), four state-of-the-art algorithms (ModuleDiscoverer, Degas, KeyPathwayMiner and ClustEx), and several pathway databases to validate the proposed algorithm. Core&Peel is the only method able to find significant associations of the predicted disease module with known validated relevant pathways for all four diseases. Moreover for the two cancer data sets, Core&Peel detects further nine relevant pathways enriched in the predicted disease module, not discovered by the other methods used in the comparative analysis. Finally we apply Core&Peel, along with other methods, to explore the transcriptional response of human cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection, at a modular level, aiming at finding supporting evidence for drug repositioning efforts.

855 Double Blind Placebo Controlled Food Challenge Useful to Disconfirm Over Estimated Diagnosis of Cmpa in Children

Background and aims: The incidence of CMPA in infancy seems to be approximately 3%. In Italy diagnosis of CMPA is often over estimated. The double-blind, placebo controlled food challenge(DBPCFC) is widely considered as the “gold standard” for the diagnosis of food allergy. Methods: 14 patients, (12 months-12 yrs) previously diagnosed as having CMPA, underwent our diagnostic algorithm in order to confirm or to exclude diagnosis. Diagnostic algorithm includes: total blood cell count, serum IgE assay, RAST, betalactotest, Prick by prick with fresh milk, chemical examination and eosinophilic cell count of the stools. DBPCFC was performed with extensively hydrolyzed formula (as placebo) VS a lactose-free, cow milk derived formula. At discharge a post challenge form was given to parents to record delayed symptoms that might occur at home. Results: 12 out of 14 patients had positive results for skin prick test (prick by prick) and four out of them also presented specific IgE against CMPs. 13 patients showed tolerance to CMP during and after DBPCFC and had no symptoms also in the next 72h. Only one patient, aged 30 months, had to keep CMP avoidance. Conclusion: In our survey DBPCFC demonstrated tolerance to CMP for all but one patients. DBPCFC is effective also to disconfirm diagnosis of CMPA. Skin prick tests and serological specific IgE do not always correlate with oral tolerance test. Subjects with positive skin prick test and high serological specific IgE against CMP but tolerant at DBPCFC may reintroduce cow milk proteins in to their dietary meals.

Health Sensors, Smart Home Devices, and the Internet of Medical Things: An Opportunity for Dramatic Improvement in Care for the Lower Extremity Complications of Diabetes.

OBJECTIVE The prevalent and long-neglected diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) and its related complications rank among the most debilitating and costly sequelae of diabetes. With the rise of the Internet of medical things (IoMT), along with smart devices, the med-tech industry is on the cusp of a home-care revolution, which could also create opportunity for developing effective solutions with significant potential to reduce DFU-associated costs and saving limbs. This article discusses potential applications of IoMT to the DFU patient population and beyond. METHODS To better understand potential opportunities and challenges associated with implementing IoMT for management of DFU, the authors reviewed recent relevant literatures and included their own expert opinions from a multidisciplinary point of view including podiatry, engineering, and data security. RESULTS The IoMT has opened digital transformation of home-based diabetic foot care, as it enables promoting patient engagement, personalized care and smart management of chronic and noncommunicable diseases through individual data-driven treatment regimens, telecommunication, data mining, and comprehensive feedback tailored to individual requirements. In particular, with recent advances in voice-activated commands technology and its integration as a part of IoMT, new opportunities have emerged to improve the patient's central role and responsibility in enabling an optimized health care ecosystem. CONCLUSIONS The IoMT has opened new opportunities in health care from remote monitoring to smart sensors and medical device integration. While it is at its early stage of development, ultimately we envisage a connected home that, using voice-controlled technology and Bluetooth-radio-connected add-ons, may augment much of what home health does today.

An immunoturbidimetric assay for rapid quantitative measurement of feline alpha-1-acid glycoprotein in serum and peritoneal fluid.

BACKGROUND Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) is an acute phase protein that increases in concentration in infectious and inflammatory conditions. The serum and peritoneal fluid concentrations of AGP may be useful in the diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a lethal disease of cats. Currently AGP can be measured by radioimmunodiffusion (RID) assays, which are time consuming and difficult. OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study were to develop a rapid immunoturbidimetric assay for measurement of AGP in feline serum and peritoneal fluid and to compare the results with those obtained by RID. METHODS AGP was purified by perchloric acid precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography from a pool of peritoneal fluid obtained from cats with FIP, as determined by a panel of laboratory tests, including serum AGP concentration, albumin: globulin ratio, and total protein concentration, anti-coronavirus antibody titers, and effusion analysis. The purified AGP in a complete Freund's adjuvant and Tween 20 mixture was injected into a sheep and blood was collected at monthly intervals. Anti-AGP antiserum, as confirmed by ELISA and Western blot techniques, and a pool of peritoneal fluid from cats with FIP were used to prepare standards. Clinical samples of feline peritoneal fluid (n=55) and serum (n=59) were assayed for AGP and results from the immunoturbidimetric and RID methods were compared. RESULTS Significant correlation (P < .001) was obtained between methods for both peritoneal fluid (R2=.9259) and serum (R2=.9448) samples. Coefficients of variation for the immunoturbidimetric method were <5%. CONCLUSIONS This rapid immunoturbidimetric assay for measurement of feline AGP in serum and peritoneal fluid may be of value in the diagnosis of FIP and possibly other inflammatory diseases in cats.

Adaptation of Russian population to SARS-CoV-2: Asymptomatic course, comorbidities, mortality, and other respiratory viruses - A reply to Fear versus Data: Short Communication to International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents

In the current research, we report results of our studying SARS-CoV-2 spread in Russia and adaptation of Russian population to it in March-June 2020. Two groups of people have been investigated: 1) 12,082 persons already proven positive for SARS-CoV-2 (clinical information is studied); 2) 7,864+4,458 persons with respiratory suspicions (PCR tests and clinical information). In the latter, SARS-CoV-2 positive persons comprised 5.37% in March and 11.42% in June 2020. A number of viral co-infections was observed for SARS-CoV-2. Rhinoviruses accounted for the largest co-infection part (7.91% of samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2); respiratory syncytial virus 7.03%; adenoviruses 4.84%; metapneumoviruses 3.29%; parainfluenza viruses 2.42%; enterovirus D68 1.10% and some other viruses (entero-, echo-, parecho-) less than 1%. In the group of 12,537 humans, SARS-CoV-2 case fatality rate was determined to be 0.6% on average (in contrast with official Russian governmental statistics that reports 1.5% mortality). It is within range of mortality caused by other common seasonal respiratory viruses (0.01-2.21% in Russia in 2012-2020 range). Most of deaths were of people with other comorbidities, also similar with different respiratory viruses. Proportion of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic carriers was 56.68% in March and 70.67% in June 2020. Obviously, this new pathogen presents a substantial risk to human population, as it was not contained at the very beginning of its outbreak in Wuhan and spread to the whole world. However, measures of its surveillance, prevention and treatment must be strictly evidence-based and not dictated by fear.

The silver lining of COVID‐19: estimation of short‐term health impacts due to lockdown in the Yangtze River Delta region, China

The outbreak of COVID‐19 in China has led to massive lockdowns in order to reduce the spread of the epidemic and control human‐to‐human transmission. Subsequent reductions in various anthropogenic activities have led to improved air quality during the lockdown. In this study, we apply a widely used exposure‐response function to estimate the short‐term health impacts associated with PM(2.5) changes over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region due to COVID‐19 lockdown. Concentrations of PM(2.5) during lockdown period reduced by 22.9% to 54.0% compared to pre‐lockdown level. Estimated PM(2.5)‐related daily premature mortality during lockdown period is 895 (95% confidential interval: 637‐1081), which is 43.3% lower than pre‐lockdown period and 46.5% lower compared with averages of 2017‐2019. According to our calculation, total number of avoided premature death associated PM(2.5) reduction during the lockdown is estimated to be 42.4 thousand over the YRD region, with Shanghai, Wenzhou, Suzhou (Jiangsu province), Nanjing, and Nantong being the top five cities with largest health benefits. Avoided premature mortality is mostly contributed by reduced death associated with stroke (16.9 thousand, accounting for 40.0%), ischemic heart disease (14.0 thousand, 33.2%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (7.6 thousand, 18.0%). Our calculations do not support or advocate any idea that pandemics produce a positive note to community health. We simply present health benefits from air pollution improvement due to large emission reductions from lowered human and industrial activities. Our results show that continuous efforts to improve air quality are essential to protect public health, especially over city‐clusters with dense population.

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in nuclear medicine departments: preliminary report of the first international survey

PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is challenging the availability of hospital resources worldwide. The Young Group of the Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine (AIMN) developed the first international survey to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in nuclear medicine (NM). The aim of this study was to perform a preliminary report of the ongoing survey. METHODS: A questionnaire of thirty questions was prepared for all NM professionals addressing three main issues: (1) new scheduling praxes for NM diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, (2) assistance of patients with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and (3) prevention of COVID-19 spreading in the departments. An invitation to the survey was sent to the corresponding authors of NM scientific papers indexed in SCOPUS in 2019. Personal data were analysed per individual responder. Organisation data were evaluated per single department. RESULTS: Two-hundred and ninety-six individual responders from 220 departments were evaluated. Most of the responders were from Europe (199/296, 67%). Approximately, all departments already changed their scheduling praxes due to the pandemic (213/220, 97%). In most departments, scheduled diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were allowed but quantitatively reduced (112/220, 51%). A significant reduction of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (more than 20%) affected 198/220 (90%) and 158/220 (72%) departments, respectively. Incidental COVID-19 signs in NM exams occurred in 106/220 departments (48%). Few departments were closed or shifted to assist patients with COVID-19 (36/220, 16%). Most of the responders thought that pandemic would not permanently change the work of NM departments in the future (189/296, 64%). CONCLUSIONS: According to this preliminary report of the first international survey, COVID-19 heavily impacted NM departments and professionals. New praxes for NM procedures, assistance, and prevention of COVID-19 have been applied during the pandemic.

Distribution of the 2019-nCoV Epidemic and Correlation with Population Emigration from Wuhan, China

BACKGROUNDS: The ongoing new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia outbreak is spreading in China and has not reached its peak. Five millions of people had emigrated from Wuhan before the city lockdown, which potentially represent a source of virus spreaders. Case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in early epidemic are of great importance for early warning and prevention of future outbreak. METHODS: The officially reported cases of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information of these cases were extracted analyzed with ArcGIS and WinBUGS. Population migration data of Wuhan City and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi and analyzed for their correlation with case number. FINDINGS: The 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases were predominantly distributed in Hubei and other provinces of South China. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan provinces that are adjacent to Hubei. While Wuhan city has the highest number of cases, the time risk is relatively stable. Numbers of cases in some cities are relatively low, but the time risks are continuously rising. The case numbers of different provinces and cities of Hubei province were highly correlated with the emigrated populations from Wuhan. Lockdown of 19 cities of Hubei province, and implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented the exponential growth of case number. INTERPRETATION: Population emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source for other cities and provinces. Some cities with low case number but were in rapid increase. Due to the upcoming Spring Festival return transport wave, understanding of the trends of risks in different regions is of great significance for preparedness for both individuals and institutions.

Electroencephalogram signatures of loss and recovery of consciousness from propofol.

Unconsciousness is a fundamental component of general anesthesia (GA), but anesthesiologists have no reliable ways to be certain that a patient is unconscious. To develop EEG signatures that track loss and recovery of consciousness under GA, we recorded high-density EEGs in humans during gradual induction of and emergence from unconsciousness with propofol. The subjects executed an auditory task at 4-s intervals consisting of interleaved verbal and click stimuli to identify loss and recovery of consciousness. During induction, subjects lost responsiveness to the less salient clicks before losing responsiveness to the more salient verbal stimuli; during emergence they recovered responsiveness to the verbal stimuli before recovering responsiveness to the clicks. The median frequency and bandwidth of the frontal EEG power tracked the probability of response to the verbal stimuli during the transitions in consciousness. Loss of consciousness was marked simultaneously by an increase in low-frequency EEG power (<1 Hz), the loss of spatially coherent occipital alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz), and the appearance of spatially coherent frontal alpha oscillations. These dynamics reversed with recovery of consciousness. The low-frequency phase modulated alpha amplitude in two distinct patterns. During profound unconsciousness, alpha amplitudes were maximal at low-frequency peaks, whereas during the transition into and out of unconsciousness, alpha amplitudes were maximal at low-frequency nadirs. This latter phase-amplitude relationship predicted recovery of consciousness. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of propofol-induced unconsciousness, establish EEG signatures of this brain state that track transitions in consciousness precisely, and suggest strategies for monitoring the brain activity of patients receiving GA.

Angiopoietin-2 as a marker of endothelial activation is a good predictor factor for intensive care unit admission of COVID-19 patients

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease has been associated with ischemic complications, coagulation disorders, and an endotheliitis. OBJECTIVES: To explore endothelial damage and activation-related biomarkers in COVID-19 patients with criteria of hospitalization for referral to intensive care unit (ICU) and/or respiratory worsening. METHODS: Analysis of endothelial and angiogenic soluble markers in plasma from patients at admission. RESULTS: Study enrolled 40 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to emergency department that fulfilled criteria for hospitalization. Half of them were admitted in conventional wards without any ICU transfer during hospitalization; whereas the 20 others were directly transferred to ICU. Patients transferred in ICU were more likely to have lymphopenia, decreased SpO2 and increased D-dimer, CRP and creatinine levels. In those patients, soluble E-selectin and angiopoietin-2 were significantly increased (p value at 0.009 and 0.003, respectively). Increase in SELE gene expression (gene coding for E-selectin protein) was confirmed in an independent cohort of 32 patients using a whole blood gene expression profile analysis. In plasma, we found a strong association between angiopoetin-2 and CRP, creatinine and D-dimers (with p value at 0.001, 0.001 and 0.003, respectively). ROC curve analysis identified an Angiopoietin-2 cut-off of 5000 pg/mL as the best predictor for ICU outcome (Se = 80.1%, Sp = 70%, PPV = 72.7%, NPV = 77%), further confirmed in multivariate analysis after adjustment for creatinine, CRP or D-dimers. CONCLUSION: Angiopoietin-2 is a relevant predictive factor for ICU direct admission in COVID-19 patients. This result showing an endothelial activation reinforces the hypothesis of a COVID-19-associated microvascular dysfunction.

Social determinants of health inequalities: towards a theoretical perspective using systems science

A systems approach offers a novel conceptualization to natural and social systems. In recent years, this has led to perceiving population health outcomes as an emergent property of a dynamic and open, complex adaptive system. The current paper explores these themes further and applies the principles of systems approach and complexity science (i.e. systems science) to conceptualize social determinants of health inequalities. The conceptualization can be done in two steps: viewing health inequalities from a systems approach and extending it to include complexity science. Systems approach views health inequalities as patterns within the larger rubric of other facets of the human condition, such as educational outcomes and economic development. This anlysis requires more sophisticated models such as systems dynamic models. An extension of the approach is to view systems as complex adaptive systems, i.e. systems that are 'open' and adapt to the environment. They consist of dynamic adapting subsystems that exhibit non-linear interactions, while being 'open' to a similarly dynamic environment of interconnected systems. They exhibit emergent properties that cannot be estimated with precision by using the known interactions among its components (such as economic development, political freedom, health system, culture etc.). Different combinations of the same bundle of factors or determinants give rise to similar patterns or outcomes (i.e. property of convergence), and minor variations in the initial condition could give rise to widely divergent outcomes. Novel approaches using computer simulation models (e.g. agent-based models) would shed light on possible mechanisms as to how factors or determinants interact and lead to emergent patterns of health inequalities of populations.

Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir against SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp): A molecular docking study

Abstract Aims A new human coronavirus (HCoV), which has been designated SARS-CoV-2, began spreading in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China causing pneumonia called COVID-19. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been faster than any other coronaviruses that have succeeded in crossing the animal-human barrier. There is concern that this new virus will spread around the world as did the previous two HCoVs—Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)—each of which caused approximately 800 deaths in the years 2002 and 2012, respectively. Thus far, 11,268 deaths have been reported from the 258,842 confirmed infections in 168 countries. Main methods In this study, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the newly emerged coronavirus is modeled, validated, and then targeted using different anti-polymerase drugs currently on the market that have been approved for use against various viruses. Key findings The results suggest the effectiveness of Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 since they tightly bind to its RdRp. In addition, the results suggest guanosine derivative (IDX-184), Setrobuvir, and YAK as top seeds for antiviral treatments with high potential to fight the SARS-CoV-2 strain specifically. Significance The availability of FDA-approved anti-RdRp drugs can help treat patients and reduce the danger of the mysterious new viral infection COVID-19. The drugs mentioned above can tightly bind to the RdRp of the SARS-CoV-2 strain and thus may be used to treat the disease. No toxicity measurements are required for these drugs since they were previously tested prior to their approval by the FDA.

High-Efficiency Same-Day Approach to Breast Reconstruction During the COVID-19 Crisis

PURPOSE: As our hospitals conserve and re-allocate resources during the COVID-19 crisis, there is urgent need to determine how best to continue caring for breast cancer patients. During the time window before the COVID-19 critical peak and particularly thereafter, as hospitals are able to resume cancer operations, we anticipate that there will be great need to maximize efficiency to treat breast cancer. The goal of this study is to present a same-day protocol that minimizes resource utilization to enable hospitals to increase inpatient capacity, while providing care for breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction during the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: IRB exempt patient quality improvement initiative was conducted to detail the operationalization of a novel same-day breast reconstruction protocol. Consecutive patients having undergone immediate breast reconstruction were prospectively enrolled between February and March of 2020 at Massachusetts General Hospital during the COVID-19 crisis. Peri-operative results and postoperative complications were summarized. RESULTS: Time interval from surgical closure to patient discharge was 5.02 ± 1.29 h. All patients were discharged home, with no re-admissions or emergency department visits. No postoperative complications were observed. CONCLUSION: This report provides an instruction manual to operationalize a same-day breast reconstruction protocol, to meet demands of providing appropriate cancer treatment during times of unprecedented resource limitations. Pre-pectoral implant-based breast reconstruction can be the definitive procedure or be used as a bridge to autologous reconstruction. Importantly, we hope this work will be helpful to our patients and community as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1007/s10549-020-05739-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Rapid detection and differentiation of dengue virus serotypes by NS1 specific reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay in patients presenting to a tertiary care hospital in Hyderabad, India

Abstract Early and rapid detection of dengue virus (DENV) infection during the acute phase of illness is crucial for proper patient management and prevention of the spread of the infection. In the present study, the standardization and validation of a one step, four tube reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (RT-LAMP) for rapid detection and serotyping of the DENV targeting NS1 gene using the Genie® II flourometer was carried out. The performance of the RT-LAMP was compared to RT-PCR, CDC 1-4 Real time PCR and the NS1 antigen ELISA, IgM and IgG anti DENV antibodies. Acute DENV infection was confirmed in 250/300 patients suspected clinically of DENV infection. RT- LAMP and CDC 1-4 Real time PCR assay was positive in 148/250 patients, while 92/250 patients were positive for anti- Dengue IgM and IgG antibodies. The RT-LAMP assay and the CDC real-time RT-PCR assay showed high concordance (k =1.0). The detection rate of acute DENV infection improved to 96% (240/250) when the results of RT-LAMP were combined with NS1 Ag, IgM and IgG ELISA. The RT-LAMP had a detection limit of 100 copies for DEN-1 and DEN-2, 10 copies for DEN-3 and DEN-4 compared to 1000 copies for DEN-1 and DEN-2, 100 copies for DEN-3 and DEN-4 by the conventional RT-PCR. The assay showed 100% specificity. The RT-LAMP assay developed in this study has potential use for early clinical diagnosis, serotyping and surveillance of DENV infection in endemic countries such as India.

Air quality changes in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic

In December 2019, a new, severe coronavirus (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan, China. Shortly after, the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in the United States. The emergence of this virus led many United States governors to enact executive orders in an effort to limit the person-to-person spread of the virus. One state that utilized such measures was New York, which contains New York City (NYC), the most populous city in the United States. Many reports have shown that due to the government-backed shutdowns, the air quality in major global cities improved. However, there has been only limited work on whether this same trend is seen throughout the United States, specifically within the densely populated NYC area. Thus, the focus of this study was to examine whether changes in air quality were observed in NYC resulting from New York State's COVID-19-associated shutdown measures. To do this, daily concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were obtained from 15 central monitoring stations throughout the five NYC boroughs for the first 17 weeks (January through May) of 2015-2020. Decreases in PM2.5 (36%) and NO2 (51%) concentrations were observed shortly after the shutdown took place; however, using a linear time lag model, when changes in these pollutant concentrations were compared to those measured during the same span of time in 2015-2019, no significant difference between the years was found. Therefore, we highlight the importance of considering temporal variability and long-term trends of pollutant concentrations when analyzing for short-term differences in air pollutant concentrations related to the COVID-19 shutdowns.

Increases in cortisol are positively associated with gains in encoding and maintenance working memory performance in young men.

Past studies have demonstrated that increases in cortisol secretion are associated with either enhancements or impairments of long-term memory, depending on the subprocess involved. However, working memory is generally studied as a unified system within the cortisol literature. The present study sought to determine if cortisol increases are positively associated with increases in performance in the encoding subprocess of working memory, and whether increases are positively or negatively associated with performance changes in the maintenance subprocess. Thirty-three young men (M = 19.4 years, SD = 0.89) participated in a change-detection task, consisting of a condition requiring encoding only and a condition requiring both encoding and maintenance. To elicit a cortisol response, participants completed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) between two administrations of the task. Cardiovascular measurements and saliva samples were obtained before the TSST (T1), and mid-way between blocks of the second administration of the change-detection task (T2), to measure autonomic and cortisol responses to the TSST evident during the second change-detection task. Cortisol increases between T1 and T2 were positively correlated with both encoding (r(32) = 0.503, p = 0.003) and maintenance (r(32) = 0.463, p = 0.007) performance. This is a novel finding as previous studies have shown an impairing effect of cortisol on working memory. The positive relation between cortisol and working memory has likely been obscured in previous tasks, which did not examine these specific subprocesses in isolation from each other. The beneficial role of cortisol in the stress response is discussed.

Spread, Circulation, and Evolution of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus

The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first documented in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in 2012 and, to date, has been identified in 180 cases with 43% mortality. In this study, we have determined the MERS-CoV evolutionary rate, documented genetic variants of the virus and their distribution throughout the Arabian peninsula, and identified the genome positions under positive selection, important features for monitoring adaptation of MERS-CoV to human transmission and for identifying the source of infections. Respiratory samples from confirmed KSA MERS cases from May to September 2013 were subjected to whole-genome deep sequencing, and 32 complete or partial sequences (20 were ≥99% complete, 7 were 50 to 94% complete, and 5 were 27 to 50% complete) were obtained, bringing the total available MERS-CoV genomic sequences to 65. An evolutionary rate of 1.12 × 10(−3) substitutions per site per year (95% credible interval [95% CI], 8.76 × 10(−4); 1.37 × 10(−3)) was estimated, bringing the time to most recent common ancestor to March 2012 (95% CI, December 2011; June 2012). Only one MERS-CoV codon, spike 1020, located in a domain required for cell entry, is under strong positive selection. Four KSA MERS-CoV phylogenetic clades were found, with 3 clades apparently no longer contributing to current cases. The size of the population infected with MERS-CoV showed a gradual increase to June 2013, followed by a decline, possibly due to increased surveillance and infection control measures combined with a basic reproduction number (R(0)) for the virus that is less than 1.

A Snapshot of SARS-CoV-2 Genome Availability up to April 2020 and its Implications: Data Analysis

BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been growing exponentially, affecting over 4 million people and causing enormous distress to economies and societies worldwide. A plethora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published both in scientific journals and through non–peer-reviewed channels to investigate the genetic heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. However, a systematic investigation of phylogenetic information and sampling bias in the available data is lacking. Although the number of available genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 is growing daily and the sequences show increasing phylogenetic information, country-specific data still present severe limitations and should be interpreted with caution. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the quality of the currently available SARS-CoV-2 full genome data in terms of sampling bias as well as phylogenetic and temporal signals to inform and guide the scientific community. METHODS: We used maximum likelihood–based methods to assess the presence of sufficient information for robust phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies in several SARS-CoV-2 sequence alignments assembled from GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) data released between March and April 2020. RESULTS: Although the number of high-quality full genomes is growing daily, and sequence data released in April 2020 contain sufficient phylogenetic information to allow reliable inference of phylogenetic relationships, country-specific SARS-CoV-2 data sets still present severe limitations. CONCLUSIONS: At the present time, studies assessing within-country spread or transmission clusters should be considered preliminary or hypothesis-generating at best. Hence, current reports should be interpreted with caution, and concerted efforts should continue to increase the number and quality of sequences required for robust tracing of the epidemic.

Another Set of Coronavirus Vaccine Candidates

I surveyed the coronavirus vaccine landscape in this post, and then detailed some of the larger efforts in the field here (several updates have been added to that one since its initial posting) Now it’s time to look at several programs that aren’t in either of those, but still have plenty of serious science behind them For an example of a relatively new technology that’s now in use for human patients, there’s the VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus) platform, which was used to produce the Ebola vaccine now manufactured by Merck Stat has an excellent long-form article from earlier this year about how this came about, and it’s well worth a read, both for the history itself and as a look into the ups and downs of vaccine research in general The Yale team behind that one had developed a promising vaccine candidate for the SARS coronavirus during its epidemic, and they’re using those lessons in their current work If you look at that second link above on vaccine candidates, you will note that there are several using adenovirus vectors – this is conceptually the same sort of thing, but using a livestock virus (VSV) instead of human or primate-associated adenoviruses I don’t know if the Yale team has partnered with anyone yet, but I should also mention another connection of theirs, a spinoff company called CaroGen that has another engineered virus platform that is also being put to use against SARS-CoV-2 These projects are aiming at FDA approval for Phase I trials, but there’s no word yet on what such an application might go in

Effect of acute respiratory infections in infancy on pulmonary function test at 3 years of age: a prospective birth cohort study

INTRODUCTION: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in infancy may have a long-term impact on the developing respiratory system. We planned a prospective cohort study to determine the impact of ARI during infancy on the pulmonary function test indices at 3 years of age. METHODS: A cohort of normal, full-term newborns were followed up 6 monthly and during ARI episodes. Infant pulmonary function tests (IPFTs) were performed at baseline and each follow-up visit using tidal breathing flow-volume loop, rapid thoracoabdominal compression (RTC) and raised volume RTC manoeuvres. During each ARI episode, nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for respiratory pathogens by real-time PCR. RESULTS: We screened 3421 neonates; 310 were enrolled; IPFT was performed in 225 (boys: 125 (55.6%)) at 3 years. During infancy, 470 ARI episodes were documented in 173 infants. At 3 years, children with history of any ARI episode during infancy had lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1.0)), forced expiratory volume in 0.75 s (FEV(0.75)), forced expiratory volume in 0.5 s (FEV(0.5)), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF(25–75)), and maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC (MEF(25)) as compared with those without any ARI episode during infancy. The ratio of tidal expiratory flow (TEF) at 25% or 50% of tidal expiratory volume to peak TEF (TEF(50) or TEF(25)/peak TEF) at 3 years was significantly increased in children who had ARI in infancy. CONCLUSIONS: ARI during infancy is associated with impaired pulmonary function indices such as increased resistance and decreased forced expiratory flow and volume at 3 years of age.

Serial measurements in COVID-19-induced acute respiratory disease to unravel heterogeneity of the disease course: design of the Maastricht Intensive Care COVID cohort; MaastrICCht

Background: The course of the disease in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in mechanically ventilated patients is unknown. To unravel the clinical heterogeneity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in these patients, we designed the prospective observational Maastricht Intensive Care COVID cohort; MaastrICCht. We incorporated serial measurements that harbour aetiological, diagnostic and predictive information. The study aims to investigate the heterogeneity of the natural course of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Study population: Mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the Intensive Care with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main message: We will collect clinical variables, vital parameters, laboratory variables, mechanical ventilator settings, chest electrical impedance tomography, electrocardiograms, echocardiography as well as other imaging modalities to assess heterogeneity of the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in critically ill patients. The MaastrICCht cohort is, also designed to foster various other studies and registries and intends to create an open-source database for investigators. Therefore, a major part of the data collection is aligned with an existing national Intensive Care data registry and two international COVID-19 data collection initiatives. Additionally, we create a flexible design, so that additional measures can be added during the ongoing study based on new knowledge obtained from the rapidly growing body of evidence. Conclusion: The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic requires the swift implementation of observational research to unravel heterogeneity of the natural course of the disease of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mechanically ventilated patients. Our design is expected to enhance aetiological, diagnostic and prognostic understanding of the disease. This paper describes the design of the MaastrICCht cohort.

Laparoscopic Salpingo-oophorectomy in Conscious Sedation.

INTRODUCTION Conscious sedation has traditionally been used for laparoscopic tubal ligation. General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation may be associated with side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, cough, and dizziness, whereas sedation offers the advantage of having the patient awake and breathing spontaneously. Until now, only diagnostic laparoscopy and minor surgical procedures have been performed in patients under conscious sedation. CASE DESCRIPTION Our report describes 5 cases of laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy successfully performed with the aid of conventional-diameter multifunctional instruments in patients under local anesthesia. Totally intravenous sedation was provided by the continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil, administered through a workstation that uses pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models to titrate each drug, as well as monitoring tools for levels of conscious sedation and local anesthesia. We have labelled our current procedure with the acronym OLICS (Operative Laparoscopy in Conscious Sedation). Four of the patients had mono- or bilateral ovarian cysts and 1 patient, with the BRCA1 gene mutation and a family history of ovarian cancer, had normal ovaries. Insufflation time ranged from 19 to 25 minutes. All patients maintained spontaneous breathing throughout the surgical procedure, and no episodes of hypotension or bradycardia occurred. Optimal pain control was obtained in all cases. During the hospital stay, the patients did not need further analgesic drugs. All the women reported high or very high satisfaction and were discharged within 18 hours of the procedure. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Salpingo-oophorectomy in conscious sedation is safe and feasible and avoids the complications of general anesthesia. It can be offered to well-motivated patients without a history of pelvic surgery and low to normal body mass index.

Critically ill healthcare workers with the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS): A multicenter study

BACKGROUND: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) leads to healthcare-associated transmission to patients and healthcare workers with potentially fatal outcomes. AIM: We aimed to describe the clinical course and functional outcomes of critically ill healthcare workers (HCWs) with MERS. METHODS: Data on HCWs was extracted from a multi-center retrospective cohort study on 330 critically ill patients with MERS admitted between (9/2012–9/2015). Baseline demographics, interventions and outcomes were recorded and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Survivors were approached with questionnaires to elucidate their functional outcomes using Karnofsky Performance Status Scale. FINDINGS: Thirty-Two HCWs met the inclusion criteria. Comorbidities were recorded in 34% (11/32) HCW. Death resulted in 8/32 (25%) HCWs including all 5 HCWs with chronic renal impairment at baseline. Non-surviving HCW had lower PaO2/FiO2 ratios 63.5 (57, 116.2) vs 148 (84, 194.3), p = 0.043, and received more ECMO therapy compared to survivors, 9/32 (28%) vs 4/24 (16.7%) respectively (p = 0.02).Thirteen of the surviving (13/24) HCWs responded to the questionnaire. Two HCWs confirmed functional limitations. Median number of days from hospital discharge until the questionnaires were filled was 580 (95% CI 568, 723.5) days. CONCLUSION: Approximately 10% of critically ill patients with MERS were HCWs. Hospital mortality rate was substantial (25%). Patients with chronic renal impairment represented a particularly high-risk group that should receive extra caution during suspected or confirmed MERS cases clinical care assignment and during outbreaks. Long-term repercussions of critical illness due to MERS on HCWs in particular, and patients in general, remain unknown and should be investigated in larger studies.

Minimally invasive surgical instruments with an accessory channel capable of integrating fibre-optic cable for optical biopsy: a review of the state of the art.

This review article provides a comprehensive overview and classification of minimally invasive surgical instruments with an accessory channel incorporating fibreoptics or another auxiliary device for various purposes. More specifically, this review was performed with the focus on the newly emerging field of optical biopsy, its objective being to discuss primarily the instruments capable of carrying out the optical biopsy and subsequent tissue resection. Instruments housing the fibreoptics for other uses, as well as instruments with an accessory channel capable of housing the fibreoptics instead of their original auxiliary device after relevant design modifications, supplement the review. The entire Espacenet and Scopus databases were searched, yielding numerous patents and articles on conceptual and existing instruments satisfying the criteria. The instruments were categorised based on the function the fibreoptics or the auxiliary device serves. On the basis of their geometrical placement with respect to the tissue resector or manipulator, the subcategories were further defined. This subdivision was used to identify the feasibility of performing the optical biopsy and the tissue resection in an accurate and successive fashion. In general, the existing concepts or instruments are regarded as limited with regard to such a functionality, either due to the placement of their accessory channel with or without the fibreoptics or due to the operational restrictions of their tissue manipulators. A novel opto-mechanical biopsy harvester, currently under development at Delft University of Technology, is suggested as a promising alternative, ensuring a fast and accurate succession of the optical and the mechanical biopsies of a flat superficial tissue.

Role of vitamin D in preventing of COVID-19 infection, progression and severity

The outbreak of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis. Little is known about the protective factors of this infection. Therefore, preventive health measures that can reduce the risk of infection, progression and severity are desperately needed. This review discussed the possible roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory tract infections and severity. Moreover, this study determined the correlation of vitamin D levels with COVID-19 cases and deaths in 20 European countries as of 20 May 2020. A significant negative correlation (p = 0.033) has been observed between mean vitamin D levels and COVID-19 cases per one million population in European countries. However, the correlation of vitamin D with COVID-19 deaths of these countries was not significant. Some retrospective studies demonstrated a correlation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality, while other studies did not find the correlation when confounding variables are adjusted. Several studies demonstrated the role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of acute viral respiratory tract infections and pneumonia. These include direct inhibition with viral replication or with anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory ways. In the meta-analysis, vitamin D supplementation has been shown as safe and effective against acute respiratory tract infections. Thus, people who are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency during this global pandemic should consider taking vitamin D supplements to maintain the circulating 25(OH)D in the optimal levels 75-125 nmol/L. In conclusion, there not enough evidence on the association between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 severity and mortality. Therefore, randomized control trials and cohort studies are necessary to test this hypothesis.

Variables affecting leakage past endotracheal tube cuffs: a bench study.

PURPOSE Leakage of oral secretions past endotracheal tubes (ETT) has been implicated in ventilator associated pneumonia. The aim of this bench study was to compare the ability of current generation ETT cuffs to prevent fluid leakage and to determine the specific mechanical ventilator settings that affect movement of fluid across an inflated ETT cuff. METHODS Using a 2.3-cm internal diameter (ID) tracheal model and simulated ventilatory support, we evaluated the impact of cuff pressure (20 and 30 cmH(2)O), positive end-expiratory pressure/continuous positive airway pressure (PEEP/CPAP, 0-15 cmH(2)O), peak inspiratory pressure (PIP, 15-45 cmH(2)O), and mode of ventilation (volume control, volume assist/control, pressure control, pressure assist/control, and CPAP) on leakage of fluid past the ETT cuffs of 16 ETTs. The tracheal model was configured in the vertical position with 35 ml of vitaminwater(®) on top of the inflated ETT cuff and mechanically ventilated. Fluid leakage past the cuff was determined by calculating the volume change in the tracheal model after each 30-min ventilation period. Initially five 8.0-mm-ID ETTs of each manufacturer type were evaluated at baseline ventilator settings. Tubes allowing a consistent leak within two SD of the mean leakage for the five tubes were numbered in consecutive order. A single tube from this group was then randomly selected for detailed evaluation. RESULTS Cuff leakage varied among ETT types (p < 0.0001); median leak volume 6.0 ml (0.6-15.1) across all tubes under all conditions. Cuff leakage was inversely related to PEEP level, cuff pressure, and PIP except when PEEP was set at 15 cmH(2)O (all p < 0.0001). In addition, cuff leak varied among modes (p = 0.035). CONCLUSION Cuff leakage varies greatly among ETT types and is affected by cuff pressure, PEEP, PIP, and mode.

[Experts recommendation on the diagnosis and treatment of oral mucosal diseases during prevention and control stage of the novel coronavirus infection].

The announcement of National Health Commission on January 20, 2020 (No. 1 of 2020) has included Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia(NCP) into the B class infectious diseases according to the law of the People's Republic of China on the prevention and control of infectious diseases, and has been managed as A class infectious diseases. People's governments at all levels and health administration departments have been paying high attention to it, and medical and health institutions have taken a series of prevention and control measures according to the law to prevent and control the spread of NCP. In the process of combating the outbreak of NCP, how to protect the oral mucosal disease physicians normatively, how to ensure hand and environmental cleaning and disinfection; how to carry out triage of the patients with oral mucosal disease accompanied by fever reasonably; how to carry out oral mucosal disease patients'self-care and self-management during this stage, are the practical problems that all levels of medical institutions and medical workers and patients will meet. For these three problems, we invited the experts from the Society of Oral Medicine, Shanghai Stomatological Association and the Oral Mucosal Disease Specialist Alliance Organization of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital Group to write the recommendation on the diagnosis and treatment of oral mucosal disease during prevention and control stage of novel coronavirus infection, in order to provide references for oral mucosal disease medical physicians and patients in this special period. This recommendation will be updated according to the situation of epidemic prevention and control in China and the new relevant diagnosis and treatment plans.

Evaluation of Nutritional Risk and its Association With Mortality Risk in Severe and Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients

BACKGROUND: The nutritional status of COVID-19 patients is unknown. This study evaluates the clinical and nutritional characteristics of severe and critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and investigates the relationship between nutritional risk and clinical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was conducted at West Campus of Union Hospital in Wuhan. Patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by a nucleic acid-positive test and identified as severe or critically ill, were enrolled in this study. Clinical data and outcomes information was collected and nutritional risk was assessed by using Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS). RESULTS: Totally, 413 patients were enrolled in this study, including 346 severe patients and 67 critically ill patients. Most patients, especially critically ill patients, had significant changes in nutrition-related parameters and inflammatory markers. As for nutritional risk, the critically ill patients had significantly higher proportion of high NRS scores (P<0.001), which were correlated with inflammatory and nutrition-related markers. Among 342 patients with NRS score &#8805;3, only 84 (25%) received nutritional support. The critically ill patients and the patients with higher NRS score had a higher risk of mortality and longer stay in hospital. In logistic regression models, one unit increased in NRS score was associated with the risk of mortality increased by 1.23 times (adjusted OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.10, 4.51, P = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Most severe and critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at nutritional risk. The patients with higher nutrition risk have worse outcome, and require nutritional therapy.

Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery for management of ovarian endometriomas.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES To compare our initial experience in laparoscopic surgery for ovarian endometriomas performed through an umbilical incision using a single 3-channel port and flexible laparoscopic instrumentation versus traditional laparoscopy. METHODS This study was conducted in 3 tertiary care referral centers. Since September 2009, we have performed laparoendoscopic single-site surgery in 24 patients diagnosed with ovarian endometriomas. A control group of patients with similar diagnoses who underwent traditional operative laparoscopy during the same period was included (n = 28). In the laparoendoscopic single-site surgery group, a multichannel port was inserted into the peritoneum through a 1.5- to 2.0-cm umbilical incision. RESULTS Patients in the laparoendoscopic single-site surgery group were significantly older (P = .04) and had a higher body mass index (P = .005). Both groups were comparable regarding history of abdominal surgery, lateral pelvic side wall involvement, and cul-de-sac involvement. After we controlled for age and body mass index, the size of the resected endometriomas, duration of surgery, and amount of operative blood loss were comparable in both groups. When required, an additional 5-mm port was inserted in the right or left lower quadrant in the laparoendoscopic single-site surgery group to allow the use of a third instrument for additional tissue retraction or manipulation (10 of 24 patients, 41.6%). However, adhesiolysis was performed more frequently in the conventional laparoscopy group. The duration of hospital stay was <24 hours in both groups. No intraoperative complications were encountered. All incisions healed and were cosmetically satisfactory. CONCLUSION The laparoendoscopic single-site surgery technique is a reasonable initial approach for the treatment of endometriomas. In our experience, an additional side port is usually needed to treat pelvic side wall and cul-de-sac endometriosis that often accompanies endometriomas.

Monitoring depth of anaesthesia in a randomized trial decreases the rate of postoperative delirium but not postoperative cognitive dysfunction.

BACKGROUND Postoperative delirium in elderly patients is a frequent complication and associated with poor outcome. The aim of this parallel group study was to determine whether monitoring depth of anaesthesia influences the incidence of postoperative delirium. METHODS Patients who were planned for surgery in general anaesthesia expected to last at least 60 min and who were older than 60 yr were included between March 2009 and May 2010. A total of 1277 patients of a consecutive sample were randomized (n=638 open, n=639 blinded) and the data of 1155 patients were analysed (n=575 open, n=580 blinded). In one group, the anaesthesiologists were allowed to use the bispectral index (BIS) data to guide anaesthesia, while in the other group, BIS monitoring was blinded. Cognitive function was evaluated at baseline, 1 week, and 3 months after operation. RESULTS Delirium incidence was lower in patients guided with BIS. Postoperative delirium was detected in 95 patients (16.7%) in the intervention group compared with 124 patients (21.4%) in the control group (P=0.036). In a multivariate analysis, the percentage of episodes of deep anaesthesia (BIS values <20) were independently predictive for postoperative delirium (P=0.006; odds ratio 1.027). BIS monitoring did not alter the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (7th day P=0.062; 90th day P=0.372). CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative neuromonitoring is associated with a lower incidence of delirium, possibly by reducing extreme low BIS values. Therefore, in high-risk surgical patients, this may give the anaesthesiologist a possibility to influence one precipitating factor in the complex genesis of delirium.

Electrocautery, Diathermy, and Surgical Energy Devices: Are Surgical Teams at Risk During the COVID-19 Pandemic?

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to provide a rapid synthesis of available data to identify the risk posed by utilizing surgical energy devices intraoperatively due to the generation of surgical smoke, an aerosol. Secondarily it aims to summarize methods to minimize potential risk to operating room staff. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Continuing operative practice during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic places the health of operating theatre staff at potential risk. SARS-CoV2 is transmitted through inhaled droplets and aerosol particles, thus posing an inhalation threat even at considerable distance. Surgical energy devices generate an aerosol of biological particular matter during use. The risk to healthcare staff through use of surgical energy devices is unknown. METHODS: This review was conducted utilizing a rapid review methodology to enable efficient generation and dissemination of information useful for concurrent clinical practice. RESULTS: There are conflicting stances on the use of energy devices and laparoscopy by different surgical governing bodies and societies. There is no definitive evidence that aerosol generated by energy devices may carry active SARS-CoV2 virus. However, investigations of other viruses have demonstrated aerosolization through energy devise use. Measures to reduce potential transmission include appropriate personal protective equipment, evacuation and filtration of surgical plume, limiting energy device use if appropriate, and adjusting endoscopic and laparoscopic practice (low CO2 pressures, evacuation through ultrafiltration systems). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of transmission of SARS-CoV2 through aerosolized surgical smoke associated with energy device use is not fully understood, however transmission is biologically plausible. Caution and appropriate measures to reduce risk to healthcare staff should be implemented when considering intraoperative use of energy devices.

Association of enteric shedding of bovine torovirus (Breda virus) and other enteropathogens with diarrhea in veal calves.

OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence, fecal shedding pattern, and association of bovine torovirus (BoTV) with diarrhea in veal calves at time of arrival and periodically throughout the first 35 days after their arrival on a veal farm. ANIMALS 62 veal calves. PROCEDURE Fecal samples collected on days 0, 4, 14, and 35 after arrival were tested for BoTV by use of ELISA and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Paired serum samples obtained from blood collected on days 0 and 35 were analyzed for BoTV antibodies with a hemagglutination inhibition assay. Fecal samples were also screened for other enteric pathogens, including rotavirus, coronavirus, and Cryptosporidium spp. RESULTS Fecal shedding of BoTV was detected in 15 of 62 (24%) calves by use of ELISA and RT-PCR assay, with peak shedding on day 4. A significant independent association between BoTV shedding and diarrhea was observed. In addition, calves shedding > or = 2 enteric pathogens were more likely to have diarrhea than calves shedding < or = 1 pathogen. Calves that were seronegative or had low antibody titers against BoTV (< or = 1:10 hemagglutination inhibition units) at arrival seroconverted to BoTV (> 4-fold increase in titer); these calves were more likely to shed virus than calves that were seropositive against BoTV at arrival. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Shedding of BoTV was strongly associated with diarrhea in neonatal veal calves during the first week after arrival at the farm. These data provide evidence that BoTV is an important pathogen of neonatal veal calves.

Risk perception and impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on work and personal lives of healthcare workers in Singapore: what can we learn?

INTRODUCTION Healthcare workers (HCWs) were at the frontline during the battle against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Understanding their fears and anxieties may hold lessons for handling future outbreaks, including acts of bioterrorism. METHOD We measured risk perception and impact on personal and work life of 15,025 HCWs from 9 major healthcare institutions during the SARS epidemic in Singapore using a self-administered questionnaire and Impact of Events Scale and analyzed the results with bivariate and multivariate statistics. RESULTS From 10,511 valid questionnaires (70% response), we found that although the majority (76%) perceived a great personal risk of falling ill with SARS, they (69.5%) also accepted the risk as part of their job. Clinical staff (doctors and nurses), staff in daily contact with SARS patients, and staff from SARS-affected institutions expressed significantly higher levels of anxiety. More than half reported increased work stress (56%) and work load (53%). Many experienced social stigmatization (49%) and ostracism by family members (31%), but most (77%) felt appreciated by society. Most felt that the personal protective measures implemented were effective (96%) and that the institutional policies and protocols were clear (93%) and timely (90%). CONCLUSION During epidemics, healthcare institutions have a duty to protect HCWs and help them cope with their personal fears and the very stressful work situation. Singapore's experience shows that simple protective measures based on sound epidemiological principles, when implemented in a timely manner, go a long way to reassure HCWs.

Family Tetraviridae

Publisher Summary This chapter describes the Tetraviridae family. The virions of the Betatetravirus genus are nonenveloped, roughly spherical, of about 40 nm in diameter and exhibit T = 4 icosahedral shell quasi-symmetry. The genome consists of ssRNA and the viruses in the genus Betatetravirus have monopartite genomes. Betatetraviruses replicate in the cytoplasm and has three distinct types of genomic organization. Most of the members of the group are serologically interrelated but distinguishable. The majority of the isolates were identified on the basis of their serological reaction with antiserum raised against NβV. All the virus species were isolated from Lepidoptera species (moths and butterflies), principally from Saturniid, Limacodid, and Noctuid moths, and no replication in other animals has been detected. In larvae, virus replication is restricted predominantly to the cells of the midgut. With the exception of PrV, no infections by members of the Betatetravirus genus have been achieved in cultured cells, even when gRNA was transfected directly into cells. At high host densities, horizontal spread appears to be the major route of infection. Suggestive evidence exists for vertical transmission, which could be responsible for the observed persistence of tetraviruses within insect populations. The viruses replicate primarily in the cytoplasm of gut cells of several Lepidoptera species. The virons of omegatetravirus genus are nonenveloped, roughly spherical, about 40 nm in diameter and exhibit T = 4 icosahedral shell quasi-symmetry. Unlike viruses in the genus Betatetravirus, viruses in the genus Omegatetravirus have bipartite genomes. As with the betatetraviruses, omegatetraviruses replicate in the cytoplasm and studies in tissue culture cells show that the HaSV replicase is localized within the cytoplasm and associates with membranes derived from the endocytic pathway.

Analysis of viral infection and biomarkers in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

OBJECTIVE: To investigate viral infection in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) in Shanghai, and to analyze the clinical characteristics and biomarkers in viral infection. METHODS: This study included all consecutive patients who were admitted for a diagnosis of AECOPD during June 2013 to May 2015. Thirty‐one stable COPD patients and 31 healthy controls were also recruited. Oropharyngeal samples were assessed, PCR for respiratory viruses were performed. Patients were divided into AECOPD virus‐positive (+) group and AECOPD virus‐negative (−) group according to viral detection. Luminex was used to detect the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in the serum. RESULTS: A total of 264 patients were included with a mean age of 75 ± 0.5 years. There were 72 patients (27.3%) identified with viral positive, of whom two patients were detected with double viral infections (FluA + FluB and RSVA + HRV, respectively). The rate of viral detection was associated with season, highest in winter. Comparisons of clinical characteristics showed no significant differences between AECOPD virus+ group and AECOPD virus− group. However, serum concentrations of interferon‐inducible protein‐10 (IP‐10) and interferon‐gamma (IFN‐γ) in virus+ AECOPD patients were significantly higher than those in the virus− AECOPD, stable COPD and healthy control groups (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Viral infection was an important pathogen in AECOPD patients; the most common viruses included FluA, HRV and FluB. It was very difficult to diagnose the viral infection according to clinical characteristics. The increased of serum IP‐10 and IFN‐γ levels might be value to indicate viral infection in AECOPD.

Predictive Value of Anastomotic Blood Supply for Anastomotic Stricture After Esophagectomy in Esophageal Cancer.

BACKGROUND Insufficient blood supply in the gastric tube is considered as a risk factor for postoperative anastomotic strictures in patients receiving esophagectomy, but the direct evidence is lacking. AIMS We aimed to investigate the correlation between perioperative blood supply in the anastomotic area of the gastric tube and the formation of anastomotic strictures in the patients undergoing esophagectomy. METHODS This prospective study included 60 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma undergoing Ivor Lewis esophagectomy between March 2014 and February 2016, which were divided into stricture group (n = 13) and non-stricture group (n = 47) based on their severity of anastomotic strictures at 3 months post-operation. The perioperative anastomotic blood supply was measured using a laser Doppler flowmetry. The gastric intramucosal pH (pHi) was measured by a gastric tonometer within 72 h post-operation. The perfusion index and gastric pHi were compared between groups. RESULTS The stricture group had a significantly lower blood flow index (P < 0.001) and gastric pHi values from day 1 to day 3 post-operation than the non-stricture group (all P < 0.001). In addition, Pearson correlation analysis showed that both the perfusion index and gastric pHi were significantly correlated with stricture size and stricture scores, respectively (r = 0.65 - 0.32, all P < 0.05). Furthermore, the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that perfusion index was an influential factor associated with postoperative anastomotic strictures (OR 0.84. 95% CI 0.72-0.98, P = 0.026). CONCLUSION These results suggested that poor blood supply in the anastomotic area of the gastric tube in the perioperative period was a risk factor for postoperative anastomotic strictures.

NMR evidence for oligosaccharide release from the dendritic‐cell specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3‐grabbing non‐integrin‐related (CLEC4M) carbohydrate recognition domain at low pH

Dendritic cell‐specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3‐grabbing non‐integrin‐related (DC‐SIGNR), also known as liver/lymph node‐specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3‐grabbing non‐integrin, CLEC4M, CD209L, and CD299, is a Ca(2+)‐dependent lectin that has been implicated in increasing the infection rates of several viruses, including HIV, but the physiological role of DC‐SIGNR in healthy cells is currently not known with certainty. A close homologue of DC‐SIGNR, dendritic‐cell specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3‐grabbing non‐integrin, has been shown to act as a recycling endocytic receptor, which binds pathogens at the cell's surface and then releases them in the low pH environment of endosomal compartments. However, it is currently under debate in the literature as to whether DC‐SIGNR plays a similar role. In this work, we used NMR to explore whether the DC‐SIGNR carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) shows any pH dependence in its ability to bind carbohydrates and Ca(2+). We found clear evidence of reduced or abolished CRD‐binding affinities for three different glycans at low pH (4.2) as compared to neutral pH (6.8). We also report the assignment of the DC‐SIGNR CRD in the apo form, and use these new results to characterize the degree of structural rearrangement upon binding (or release) of Ca(2+). Finally, we report a differential effect of pH on the affinities of glycans containing mannose exclusively versus glycans containing GlcNAc moieties. Our results lead us to propose that the DC‐SIGNR CRD rapidly and reversibly releases glycan ligands and Ca(2+) at reduced pH (behaviour that would be expected for an endocytic receptor), and that the binding of mannose‐containing oligosaccharides is more strongly affected by pH than the binding of GlcNAc‐containing oligosaccharides.

Management of orthopaedic and traumatology patients during the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in northern Italy

PURPOSE: This article aims to share northern Italy's experience in hospital re-organization and management of clinical pathways for traumatic and orthopaedic patients in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Authors collected regional recommendations to re-organize the healthcare system during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, 2020. The specific protocols implemented in an orthopaedic hospital, selected as a regional hub for minor trauma, are analyzed and described in this article. RESULTS: Two referral centres were identified as the hubs for minor trauma to reduce the risk of overload in general hospitals. These two centres have specific features: an emergency room, specialized orthopaedic surgeons for joint diseases and trauma surgeons on-call 24/7. Patients with trauma without the need for a multi-disciplinary approach or needing non-deferrable elective orthopaedic surgery were moved to these hospitals. Authors report the internal protocols of one of these centres. All elective surgery was stopped, outpatient clinics limited to emergencies and specific pathways, ward and operating theatre dedicated to COVID-19-positive patients were implemented. An oropharyngeal swab was performed in the emergency room for all patients needing to be admitted, and patients were moved to a specific ward with single rooms to wait for the results. Specific courses were organized to demonstrate the correct use of personal protection equipment (PPE). CONCLUSION: The structure of the orthopaedic hubs, and the internal protocols proposed, could help to improve the quality of assistance for patients with musculoskeletal disorders and reduce the risk of overload in general hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Effect on Thromboprophylaxis among Hospitalized Patients Using a System-wide Multifaceted Quality Improvement Intervention: Rationale and Design for a Multicenter Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial in China

ABSTRACT Background Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a life-threatening disease that can affect each hospitalized patient. But the current in-hospital thromboprophylaxis remains suboptimal and there exists a large gap between clinical practice and guideline-recommended care in China. Methods To facilitate implementation of guideline recommendations, we conduct a multicenter, adjudicator-blinded, cluster-randomized clinical trial, aiming to assess the effectiveness of a system-wide multifaceted quality improvement (QI) strategy on VTE prophylaxis improvement and thromboembolism reduction in clinical setting. Hospitals are randomized into intervention or control group. In intervention group, hospitals receive the concept of appropriate in-hospital thromboprophylaxis plus a multifaceted QI which encompasses four components: (1) an electronic alert combining computer-based clinical decision support system and electronic reminders, (2) appropriate prophylaxis based on dynamic VTE and bleeding risk assessments, (3) periodical audit and interactive feedback on performance, (4) strengthened training and patient education. In control, hospitals receive the concept of recommended prophylaxis alone without QI. Thromboprophylaxis will be at the discretion of hospitals and conducted as usual. With a final sample size of 5760 hospitalized patients in 32 hospitals on mainland China, this trial will examine the effect of QI on improvement in thromboprophylaxis and patient-centered outcomes. This is an open-label trial that patients and healthcare professionals will know group allocation after enrollment, but endpoint adjudicators and statisticians will be blinded. RCT# NCT04211181 Conclusions The system-wide multifaceted QI intervention is expected to facilitate implementation of recommended VTE prophylaxis in hospital, thereafter reducing VTE incidence and relevant adverse events among hospitalized patients in China.

Mutual Moral Obligations in the Prevention of Infectious Diseases

Not so long ago health policy was about little more than the provision of medical care. The availability of treatment is important for those in need of cure, but by now it is a well-shown fact that health is generally determined to a much greater extent by other factors. Genetic constitution, lifestyle choices and socio-economic environment largely explain why some of us become ill or die earlier than others who remain healthy (Mackenbach 1996; McKeown 1976; Wilkinson and Marmot 2003). While some of these factors fall under the control of an individual, the majority does not. Research increasingly indicates how remarkably sensitive our health seems to be to what has become known as the ‘social determinants of health’. These factors generally fall beyond the control of an individual, but can nonetheless be influenced on a population level. This causes a shift in the focus of health policy from the classic provision of health care to policies specifically designed to influence the causal factors of ill-health in different non-medical fields. The flipside of that evolution is a significant increase of the state’s influence in the sphere of individual lives. A pertinent question remains the one that asks for the legitimate role of governments in modifying, discouraging or prohibiting behaviors that lead to ill-health. To what extent can and should we hold public policy responsible for us leading a healthy life? Most scholars will argue that governments indeed have a role to play, but that the limits will be reached when public health measures would imply large sacrifices of individual liberty.

Structural Basis of the Potential Binding Mechanism of Remdesivir to SARS-CoV-2 RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase

Starting from late 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a once-in-a-century pandemic with deadly consequences, which urgently calls for new treatments, cures, and supporting apparatuses. Recently, because of its positive results in clinical trials, remdesivir was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID-19 through Emergency Use Authorization. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations and free energy perturbation methods to study the inhibition mechanism of remdesivir to its target SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We first constructed the homology model of this polymerase based on a previously available structure of SARS-CoV NSP12 RdRp (with a sequence identity of 95.8%). We then built a putative preinsertion binding structure by aligning the remdesivir + RdRp complex to the ATP bound poliovirus RdRp without the RNA template. The putative binding structure was further optimized with molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting stable preinsertion state of remdesivir appeared to form hydrogen bonds with the RNA template when aligned with the newly solved cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The relative binding free energy between remdesivir and ATP was calculated to be -2.80 ± 0.84 kcal/mol, where remdesivir bound much stronger to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp than the natural substrate ATP. The â¼100-fold improvement in the Kd from remdesivir over ATP indicates an effective replacement of ATP in blocking of the RdRp preinsertion site. Key residues D618, S549, and R555 are found to be the contributors to the binding affinity of remdesivir. These findings suggest that remdesivir can potentially act as a SARS-CoV-2 RNA-chain terminator, effectively stopping its RNA replication, with key residues also identified for future lead optimization and/or drug resistance studies.

Advancements in prophylactic and therapeutic nanovaccines

Abstract Vaccines activate suitable immune responses to fight against diseases but can possess limitations such as compromised efficacy and immunogenic responses, poor stability, and requirement of adherence to multiple doses. ‘Nanovaccines’ have been explored to elicit a strong immune response with the advantages of nano-sized range, high antigen loading, enhanced immunogenicity, controlled antigen presentation, more retention in lymph nodes and promote patient compliance by a lower frequency of dosing. Various types of nanoparticles with diverse pathogenic or foreign antigens can help to overcome immunotolerance and alleviate the need of booster doses as required with conventional vaccines. Nanovaccines have the potential to induce both cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immunity and can render long-lasting immunogenic memory. With such properties, nanovaccines have shown high potential for the prevention of infectious diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, and cancer. Their therapeutic potential has also been explored in the treatment of cancer. The various kinds of nanomaterials used for vaccine development and their effects on immune system activation have been discussed with special relevance to their implications in various pathological conditions. Statement of Significance Interaction of nanoparticles with the immune system has opened multiple avenues to combat a variety of infectious and non-infectious pathological conditions. Limitations of conventional vaccines have paved the path for nanomedicine associated benefits with a hope of producing effective nanovaccines. This review highlights the role of different types of nanovaccines and the role of nanoparticles in modulating the immune response of vaccines. The applications of nanovaccines in infectious and non-infectious diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS, influenza, and cancers have been discussed. It will help the readers develop an understanding of mechanisms of immune activation by nanovaccines and design appropriate strategies for novel nanovaccines.

Implementation of a Novel Remote Physician SBRT Coverage Process during the Coronavirus Pandemic

INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, alternative methods of care are needed to reduce the relative risk of transmission in departments. Also needed is the ability to provide vital radiation oncological care if radiation oncologists (RO) are reallocated to other departments. We implemented a novel remote RO SBRT coverage practice, requiring it to be reliable, of high audio and visual quality, timely, and the same level of specialty care as our current in-person treatment coverage practice. METHODS: All observed failure modes were recorded during implementation over the first 15 sequential fractions. The time from CBCT to treatment was calculated before and after implementation to determine timeliness of remote coverage. Image quality metrics were calculated between the imaging console screen and the RO's shared screen. Comfort levels with audio/visual communication as well as overall comfort in comparison to in-person RO coverage was evaluated using Likert scale surveys after treatment. RESULTS: Remote RO SBRT coverage was successfully implemented in 14/15 fractions with 3 observed process failures that were all corrected before treatment. Average times of pre-treatment coverage before and after implementation were 8.74 and 8.51min, respectively. The cross correlation between the imaging console screen and RO's shared screen was r=0.96 and lag was 0.05s. The average value for all survey questions was above 4.5, approaching in-person RO coverage comfort levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel method of remote RO SBRT coverage permits reduced personnel and patient interactions surrounding RT procedures. This may help to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in our department and provides a means for SBRT coverage if ROs are reallocated to other areas of the hospital for COVID-19 support.

Technical characteristics can make the difference in a surgical linear stapler. Or not?

BACKGROUND Anastomotic leak (AL) after gastrointestinal surgery is a severe complication associated with relevant short- and long-term sequelae. Most of the anastomosis are currently performed with a surgical stapler that is required to have appropriate characteristics to guarantee good performances. The aim of our study was to evaluate, in the laboratory, pressure resistance and tensile strength of anastomosis performed with different surgical linear staplers, available in the market. MATERIALS AND METHODS We have been studying three linear staplers, with diverse cartridges and staple heights, of three different companies, used for gastrointestinal anastomosis and gastric or intestinal closure. We performed 50 anastomosis for each device, with the pertinent different cartridges, on fresh pig intestine, for a total of 350 anastomosis, then injected saline solution and recorded the pressure that provokes a leak on the staple line. There were no statistically significant differences between the mean pressure necessary to induce an AL in the various instruments (P > 0.05). For studying the tensile strength, we performed a total of 350 anastomosis with the different linear staplers on a special strong paper (Tyvek), then recorded the maximal tensile force that could open the anastomosis. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences between the different staplers about the strength necessary to open the staple line (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS we demonstrated that different linear staplers of three companies available in the market give comparable anastomotic pressure resistance and tensile strength. This might suggest that small dissimilarities between different devices are not involved, at least as major parameters, in AL etiology.

A prospective study comparing patient-reported outcomes in Crohn's disease.

BACKGROUND Patient reported outcomes are important in Crohn's disease. In this prospective cohort, we investigated the performance of the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) and a visual analog scale (VAS) for abdominal pain as outcome measures in Crohn's disease. METHODS Patients with active Crohn's disease starting glucocorticoids or anti-tumor necrosis factor were included. Before treatment and 10 weeks later we collected: clinical activity [Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) and Crohn's-Disease-Activity-Index (CDAI)], serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin, and BSFS (1-7) and a 100-mm VAS based on a 7-day diary. Clinical response was defined as a reduction by at least 3 and at least 100 of HBI and CDAI, respectively. Fecal calprotectin-response and CRP-response were defined as reduction of at least 50%. RESULTS Thirty-eight patients completed follow-up. At baseline, BSFS-parameters correlated more strongly with clinical activity (range: rs: 0.31-0.74) than with CRP (rs: -0.01 to 0.16) and fecal calprotectin (rs: 0.14-0.26). VAS scores correlated very weakly to moderately with clinical activity (rs: 0.18-0.45), and weakly to moderately with CRP (rs: 0.24-0.34) and fecal calprotectin (rs: 0.35-0.43). Changes in VAS scores correlated moderately to strongly (rs: 0.55-0.71) with changes in clinical activity, and weakly with changes in CRP and fecal calprotectin (rs: 0.21-0.35). Changes in BSFS parameters correlated weakly to moderately (rs: 0.23-0.53) with changes in clinical activity, and very weakly to weakly (rs: 0.01-0.35) with changes in CRP and fecal calprotectin. Responsiveness of VAS and BSFS was moderate to high (Guyatt's statistic 0.41-2.17) and highly dependent on the definition of response. CONCLUSIONS The BSFS and a VAS appear to be responsive with moderate-to-strong construct validity to monitor patients with Crohn's disease.

Ultrafiltration attenuates cardiopulmonary bypass–induced acute lung injury in a canine model of single-lung transplantation

Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass and ultrafiltration on graft function in a canine single-lung transplantation model. Methods Fifteen left single-lung transplantations were done in weight-mismatched canine pairs. The animals were divided into 3 groups: group 1, in which transplantation was done without cardiopulmonary bypass; group 2, in which transplantation was done with cardiopulmonary bypass and in which the cardiopulmonary bypass flow was decreased slowly with controlled pulmonary artery pressure; and group 3, in which transplantation was done with cardiopulmonary bypass and ultrafiltration. Hemodynamic parameters and lung function were monitored for 6 hours after reperfusion. The grafts were harvested for histologic studies, myeloperoxidase assay, and real-time quantitive reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction of mRNA encoding interleukin 6. Results The hemodynamic parameters were similar among the 3 groups. In group 1 Pao 2 and alveolar to arterial gradient for O2 levels were excellent throughout the 6-hour observation period, but in group 2 they progressively deteriorated. However, ultrafiltration significantly (P = .02) improved the Pao 2 level in group 3. On histology, interstitial edema and polynuclear cell infiltration were most marked in group 2 and significantly worse than in groups 1 and 3. Myeloperoxidase assay and real-time quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction showed increased myeloperoxidase activity and interleukin 6 gene expression in group 2 grafts compared with group 1 grafts. Myeloperoxidase activity and interleukin 6 gene expression were suppressed with ultrafiltration. Conclusions Cardiopulmonary bypass had negative effects on the graft, but ultrafiltration attenuated acute lung dysfunction by reducing the inflammatory response.

The Risk of Diabetes on Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Retrospective Cohort Study

BACKGROUND: To determine the role of diabetes mellitus (DM) in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we explored the clinical characteristics of patients with DM and compared risk factors such as age, glycemic control, and medications to those without DM. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 117 confirmed patients with COVID-19 which conducted at a tertiary hospital in Daegu, South Korea. The primary outcome was defined as the severe and critical outcome (SCO), of which the composite outcomes of acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, intensive care unit care, and 28-day mortality. We analyzed what clinical features and glycemic control-related factors affect the prognosis of COVID-19 in the DM group. RESULTS: After exclusion, 110 participants were finally included. DM patients (n=29) was older, and showed higher blood pressure compared to non-DM patients. DM group showed higher levels of inflammation-related biomarkers and severity score, and highly progressed to SCO. After adjustment with other risk factors, DM increased the risk of SCO (odds ratio [OR], 10.771; P<0.001). Among the DM patients, SCO was more prevalent in elderly patients of &#8805;70 years old and age was an independent risk factor for SCO in patients with DM (OR, 1.175; P=0.014), while glycemic control was not. The use of medication did not affect the SCO, but the renin-angiotensin system inhibitors showed protective effects against acute cardiac injury (OR, 0.048; P=0.045). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 patients with DM had higher severity and resulted in SCO. Intensive and aggressive monitoring of COVID-19 clinical outcomes in DM group, especially in elderly patients is warranted.

Development of a highly sensitive real-time nested RT-PCR assay in a single closed tube for detection of enterovirus 71 in hand, foot, and mouth disease

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the major causative agents of outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). A commercial TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR assay has been widely used for the differential detection of EV71 despite its relatively high cost and failure to detect samples with a low viral load (Ct value > 35). In this study, a highly sensitive real-time nested RT-PCR (RTN RT-PCR) assay in a single closed tube for detection of EV71 in HFMD was developed. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay were evaluated using a reference EV71 stock and a panel of controls consisting of coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) and common respiratory viruses, respectively. The clinical performance of this assay was evaluated and compared with those of a commercial TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay and a traditional two-step nested RT-PCR assay. The limit of detection for the RTN RT-PCR assay was 0.01 TCID(50)/ml, with a Ct value of 38.3, which was the same as that of the traditional two-step nested RT-PCR assay and approximately tenfold lower than that of the qRT-PCR assay. When testing the reference strain EV71, this assay showed favorable detection reproducibility and no obvious cross-reactivity. The testing results of 100 clinical throat swabs from HFMD-suspected patients revealed that 41 samples were positive for EV71 by both RTN RT-PCR and traditional two-step nested RT-PCR assays, whereas only 29 were EV71 positive by qRT-PCR assay.

Endovascular treatment of 404 intracranial aneurysms treated with nexus detachable coils: short-term and mid-term results from a prospective, consecutive, European multicenter study.

BACKGROUND Aneurysm recanalization remains a limitation of endovascular treatment. A new type of bioactive coil, the polyglycolic/polylactic acid-covered platinum microfilaments Nexus coil (ev3/Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA), has been proposed. The objective is to evaluate the safety and short-term and mid-term efficacy of Nexus coils in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS The ENDECOR (European Nexus Detachable Coil Registry) is the first prospective, consecutive, multicenter non-randomized registry. After providing informed consent, 390 patients (238 women and 152 men; mean age, 51.6 years) with 404 ruptured or unruptured aneurysms were enrolled at 34 centers. Treatment was performed with at least 75 % of coil length as Nexus coils. Clinical and technical complications were systematically reported. An independent core laboratory evaluated angiographic results by using the Raymond Grading Scale. RESULTS Complete occlusion was seen in 181 aneurysms (48 %); neck remnant in 86 aneurysms (22 %) and aneurysm remnant in 111 aneurysms (30 %). Technical and clinical complications related to the procedure occurred in 33 patients (8.5 %). At discharge, overall mortality and permanent-morbidity were 4.1 % (16/390) and 5.6 % (14/251), respectively. Angiographic mean follow-up of 13.3 months was obtained in 233 of 390 patients (64.4 %) harboring 247 aneurysms. Recanalization was observed in 44 aneurysms (17.7 %), and progressive thrombosis was observed in 53 aneurysms (21.6 %). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms with Nexus coils was associated with low morbidity and mortality rates. Efficacy of Nexus coils was comparable to published series of intracranial aneurysms treated with bare platinum coils, but their efficacy to prevent aneurysm recanalization was not demonstrated.

Changing care pathways and between-center practice variations in intensive care for traumatic brain injury across Europe: a CENTER-TBI analysis

PURPOSE: To describe ICU stay, selected management aspects, and outcome of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Europe, and to quantify variation across centers. METHODS: This is a prospective observational multicenter study conducted across 18 countries in Europe and Israel. Admission characteristics, clinical data, and outcome were described at patient- and center levels. Between-center variation in the total ICU population was quantified with the median odds ratio (MOR), with correction for case-mix and random variation between centers. RESULTS: A total of 2138 patients were admitted to the ICU, with median age of 49 years; 36% of which were mild TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale; GCS 13–15). Within, 72 h 636 (30%) were discharged and 128 (6%) died. Early deaths and long-stay patients (> 72 h) had more severe injuries based on the GCS and neuroimaging characteristics, compared with short-stay patients. Long-stay patients received more monitoring and were treated at higher intensity, and experienced worse 6-month outcome compared to short-stay patients. Between-center variations were prominent in the proportion of short-stay patients (MOR = 2.3, p < 0.001), use of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring (MOR = 2.5, p < 0.001) and aggressive treatments (MOR = 2.9, p < 0.001); and smaller in 6-month outcome (MOR = 1.2, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Half of contemporary TBI patients at the ICU have mild to moderate head injury. Substantial between-center variations exist in ICU stay and treatment policies, and less so in outcome. It remains unclear whether admission of short-stay patients represents appropriate prudence or inappropriate use of clinical resources.

Role of robotic surgery in urogynecologic surgery and radical hysterectomy: how far can we go?

PURPOSE OF REVIEW The purpose is to review the current literature regarding robotic assistance in urogynecologic surgery and radical pelvic surgery and to discuss the future of robotics in these two areas of gynecology. RECENT FINDINGS When the first and only Food and Drug Administration-approved robot-assisted device, the daVinci surgical system, was approved for use in gynecology in April 2005, many procedures were translated to a robotic approach. In the field of urogynecology, much attention was given to the use of robotic assistance for sacrocolpopexy. In oncology, there was an attraction to the use of robotics for radical hysterectomies. There are a number of published observational studies comparing the outcomes of both robot-assisted laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (RALS) and robot-assisted radical hysterectomy (RRH) to their conventional laparoscopic and open versions. Overall, the literature suggests that the use of robotics for these procedures increases operative time and cost, but decreases estimated blood loss and length of stay. The complication rates appear to be similar. Recurrence of apical prolapse after RALS appears to be similar to that in conventional laparoscopic or open sacrocolpopexy. The number of lymph nodes harvested is the same or increases with RRH, whereas the disease-free progression and overall survival are similar for all the methods of radical hysterectomy. SUMMARY Literature suggests that RALS and RRH have equivalent outcomes when compared to conventional laparoscopic and open techniques. The question is whether the use of robotics that combines the outcomes of an open procedure, the benefits of minimally invasive surgery, and easy adoptability will outweigh the increased cost and time associated with robotic surgery.

Rates of coinfection with other respiratory pathogens in patients positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19)

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess coinfection rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) with other respiratory infections on presentation. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of data from a 2 hospital academic medical centers and 2 urgent care centers during the initial 2 weeks of testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) , March 10, 2020 to March 23, 2020. Testing was targeted toward high‐risk patients following US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Demographics include age group and sex. Laboratory test results included SARS‐CoV‐2, rapid influenza A/B, and upper respiratory pathogen nucleic acid detection. Patient demographics and coinfections are presented overall and by test results with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Complete laboratory results from the first 2 weeks of testing were available for 471 emergency department patients and 117 urgent care center patients who were tested for SARS‐CoV. A total of 51 (8.7%) patients tested positive for COVID‐19 with only 1 of these patients also testing positive for another respiratory infection. One of the patients positive for COVID‐19 also tested positive for influenza A. Among the 537 patients who were screened and tested negative for COVID‐19, there were 33 (6.1%) patients who tested positive in the upper respiratory pathogen nucleic acid detection test. CONCLUSION: In our study investigating coinfections among 51 patients testing positive for COVID‐19, 1 patient also tested positive for influenza A. Although we found limited coinfections in our emergency department and urgent care center patient populations, further research is needed to assess potential coinfection in patients with COVID‐19.

Derivation and validation of a prognostic score for neonatal mortality in Ethiopia: a case-control study

BACKGROUND: Early warning scores for neonatal mortality have not been designed for low income countries. We developed and validated a score to predict mortality upon admission to a NICU in Ethiopia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study at the University of Gondar Hospital, Gondar, Ethiopia. Neonates hospitalized in the NICU between January 1, 2016 to June 31, 2017. Cases were neonates who died and controls were neonates who survived. RESULTS: Univariate logistic regression identified variables associated with mortality. The final model was developed with stepwise logistic regression. We created the Neonatal Mortality Score, which ranged from 0 to 52, from the model’s coefficients. Bootstrap analysis internally validated the model. The discrimination and calibration were calculated. In the derivation dataset, there were 207 cases and 605 controls. Variables associated with mortality were admission level of consciousness, admission respiratory distress, gestational age, and birthweight. The AUC for neonatal mortality using these variables in aggregate was 0.88 (95% CI 0.85–0.91). The model achieved excellent discrimination (bias-corrected AUC) under internal validation. Using a cut-off of 12, the sensitivity and specificity of the Neonatal Mortality Score was 81 and 80%, respectively. The AUC for the Neonatal Mortality Score was 0.88 (95% CI 0.85–0.91), with similar bias-corrected AUC. In the validation dataset, there were 124 cases and 122 controls, the final model and the Neonatal Mortality Score had similar discrimination and calibration. CONCLUSIONS: We developed, internally validated, and externally validated a score that predicts neonatal mortality upon NICU admission with excellent discrimination and calibration.

Comparison of comorbidity resolution and improvement between laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding.

BACKGROUND This study aimed to compare the rates for resolution and improvement of common comorbidities between laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. The comorbid conditions included were type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemias (LPD), degenerative joint disease (DJD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and asthma. METHODS A retrospective chart review of the patients who underwent LSG or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding at our institution from July 2004 to July 2007 was performed. The resolution of comorbidities was determined via patient-completed questionnaires and objective data. RESULTS Of the 123 patients (29 men and 94 women) reviewed, 49 had undergone LSG, and 74 had undergone laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. The mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 52 kg/m(2) for the LSG patients and 44 kg/m(2) for the laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding patients. The overall percentages of excess weight loss (%EWL) were respectively 50.6 and 40.3% (P = 0.03) during mean follow-up periods of 15 and 17 months. There was a greater resolution or improvement of DM after LSG (100% vs 46%), HTN (78% vs 48%), and LPD (87% vs. 50%) than after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Other comorbidities resolved or improved at a similar rate. CONCLUSIONS Although both LSG and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding resulted in postoperative improvement or resolution of comorbidities associated with obesity, LSG statistically showed a significantly higher rate of resolution or improvement of DM, HTN, and LPD. There was no significant difference between the groups for DJD, GERD, OSA, or asthma.

Ultrasound assessment of subglottic region for estimation of appropriate endotracheal tube size in pediatric anesthesia.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS Endotracheal tube (ETT) selection in pediatric patients is mainly done with the age, height, or weight-based formula. We compared ultrasound assessment of the subglottic area to predict the outer diameter of the ETT, with that of modified Cole's formula. The aim of the study is to compare the appropriateness of uncuffed ETT selection based on modified Cole's formula with that of ultrasound assessment method of subglottic diameter in children undergoing surgical procedures under general anesthesia. MATERIAL AND METHODS This is a prospective, randomized, parallel group study. One hundred and fifty American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II patients of age 2-6 years were randomly allotted into two groups: Group A - ETT selection based on ultrasound assessment of subglottic diameter. Group B - ETT selection based on modified Cole's formula. The study parameters are the internal diameter and external diameter (OD) of the predicted ETT by the two methods and that of the appropriate size ETT used. RESULTS The incidence of appropriate tube selection was 74.7% in the ultrasound based group while it was 45.3% in the modified Cole's formula group. There was a strong correlation between OD of the optimal ETT used and the ultrasound assessed subglottic diameter. Bland-Altman analysis of OD of appropriately sized ETT and subglottic diameter by ultrasound assessment has a bias of 0.02 mm with limits of agreement of +1.78 to -1.74. CONCLUSION Ultrasonographic assessment of the subglottic diameter at the cricoid region is a better tool in predicting the appropriate size uncuffed ETT than modified Cole's formula.

Anesthetic induction with etomidate, rather than propofol, is associated with increased 30-day mortality and cardiovascular morbidity after noncardiac surgery.

BACKGROUND Because etomidate impairs adrenal function and blunts the cortisol release associated with surgical stimulus, we hypothesized that patients induced with etomidate suffer greater mortality and morbidity than comparable patients induced with propofol. METHODS We evaluated the electronic records of 31,148 ASA physical status III and IV patients who had noncardiac surgery at the Cleveland Clinic. Among these, anesthesia was induced with etomidate and maintained with volatile anesthetics in 2616 patients whereas 28,532 were given propofol for induction and maintained with volatile anesthetics. Two thousand one hundred forty-four patients given etomidate were propensity matched with 5233 patients given propofol and the groups compared on 30-day postoperative mortality, length of hospital stay, cardiovascular and infectious morbidities, vasopressor requirement, and intraoperative hemodynamics. RESULTS Patients given etomidate had 2.5 (98% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-3.4) times the odds of dying than those given propofol. Etomidate patients also had significantly greater odds of having cardiovascular morbidity (odds ratio [OR] [98% CI]: 1.5 [1.2-2.0]), and significantly longer hospital stay (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.82 [0.78-0.87]). However, infectious morbidity (OR [98% CI]: 1.0 [0.8-1.2]) and intraoperative vasopressor use (OR [95% CI] 0.92: [0.82-1.0]) did not differ between the agents. CONCLUSION Etomidate was associated with a substantially increased risk for 30-day mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and prolonged hospital stay. Our conclusions, especially on 30-day mortality, are robust to a strong unmeasured binary confounding variable. Although our study showed only an association between etomidate use and worse patients' outcomes but not causal relationship, clinicians should use etomidate judiciously, considering that improved hemodynamic stability at induction may be accompanied by substantially worse longer-term outcomes.

Fetal heart rate changes on the cardiotocograph trace secondary to maternal COVID-19 infection

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cardiotocograph (CTG) changes in women with symptomatic COVID-19 infection. STUDY DESIGN: 12 anonymised CTG traces from 2 hospitals in Spain were retrospectively analysed by 2 independent assessors. CTG parameters were studied based on fetal pathophysiological responses to inflammation and hypoxia that would be expected based on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients. Correlation was made with perinatal outcomes (Apgar score at 5 min and umbilical cord pH). RESULTS: All fetuses showed an increased baseline FHR > 10 percent compared to the initial recording, in addition to absence of accelerations. 10 out of 12 CTG traces (83.3 percent) demonstrated late or prolonged decelerations and 7 out of 12 fetuses (58.3 percent) showed absence of cycling. Not a single case of sinusoidal pattern was observed. ZigZag pattern was found in 4 CTG traces (33 percent). Excessive uterine activity was observed in all CTG traces where uterine activity was monitored (10 out of 12). Apgar scores at 5 min were normal (>7) and absence of metabolic acidosis was found in the umbilical cord arterial pH (pH > 7.0) in the cases that were available (11 and 9, respectively). CONCLUSION: Fetuses of COVID-19 patients showed a raised baseline FHR (>10 percent), loss of accelerations, late decelerations, ZigZag pattern and absence of cycling probably due to the effects of maternal pyrexia, maternal inflammatory response and the "cytokine storm". However, the perinatal outcomes appear to be favourable. Therefore, healthcare providers should optimise the maternal environment first to rectify the reactive CTG changes instead of performing an urgent operative intervention.

Examining the effect of social distancing on the compound growth rate of COVID-19 at the county level (United States) using statistical analyses and a random forest machine learning model

OBJECTIVES: The goal of the present work is to investigate trends among US counties and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) growth rates in relation to the existence of shelter-in-place (SIP) orders in that county. STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective cohort study. METHODS: Compound growth rates were calculated using cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases from January 21, 2020, to March 31, 2020, in all 3139 US counties. Compound growth was chosen as it gives a single number that can be used in machine learning to represent the speed of virus spread during defined time intervals. Statistical analyses and a random forest machine learning model were used to analyze the data for differences in counties with and without SIP orders. RESULTS: Statistical analyses revealed that the March 16 presidential recommendation (limiting gatherings to &#8804;10 people) lowered the compound growth rate of COVID-19 for all counties in the US by 6.6%, and the counties that implemented SIP after March 16 had a further reduction of 7.8% compared with the counties that did not implement SIP after March 16. A random forest machine learning model was built to predict compound growth rate after a SIP order and was found to have an accuracy of 92.3%. The random forest found that population, longitude, and population per square mile were the most important features when predicting the effect of SIP. CONCLUSIONS: SIP orders were found to be effective at reducing the growth rate of COVID-19 cases in the US. Counties with a large population or a high population density were found to benefit the most from a SIP order.

Oral immunization with LacVax® OmpA induces protective immune response against Shigella flexneri 2a ATCC 12022 in a murine model

Abstract Shigellosis is an acute invasive disease of the lower intestine, which afflicts millions of people worldwide with an estimated one million fatalities per annum. Despite of extensive research during the last two decades, a vaccine against multi-drug resistant Shigella is not yet available in the market. To provide a safe, effective and broad-spectrum vaccine against Shigella, we explored food grade bacteria Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) for the delivery of conserved antigenic protein; Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) to the mucosal sites for effective elicitation of systemic and mucosal immunity. We have previously confirmed the immunogenic potential of recombinant L. lactis expressing OmpA (LacVax® OmpA) in BALB/c mice. In the present study, we have characterized the humoral and cellular immune profile of LacVax® OmpA and assessed its protective efficacy using a newly developed human like murine shigellosis model. The significant increase in OmpA specific serum IgG, fecal sIgA and a Th1 dominant immune response (indicated by high INF-γ/IL-4 ratio) in LacVax® OmpA immunized mice revealed successful activation of humoral and cellular immunity. The LacVax® OmpA immunized animals were also protected from human-like shigellosis when challenged with S. flexneri 2a ATCC 12022. The antigen specific serum IgG, fecal sIgA, INF-γ and IL-10 levels were found to be the significant correlates of protection. Collectively these results suggest that the LacVax® OmpA is a promising prophylactic candidate against shigellosis. However, the protective efficacy of LacVax® OmpA in the higher animals would further strengthen its future application in humans.

Noninvasive respiratory support in the hypoxaemic peri-operative/periprocedural patient: a joint ESA/ESICM guideline

Hypoxaemia is a potential life-threatening yet common complication in the peri-operative and periprocedural patient (e.g. during an invasive procedure at risk of deterioration of gas exchange, such as bronchoscopy). The European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) developed guidelines for the use of noninvasive respiratory support techniques in the hypoxaemic patient in the peri-operative and periprocedural period. The panel outlined five clinical questions regarding treatment with noninvasive respiratory support techniques [conventional oxygen therapy (COT), high flow nasal cannula, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)] for hypoxaemic patients with acute peri-operative/periprocedural respiratory failure. The goal was to assess the available literature on the various noninvasive respiratory support techniques, specifically studies that included adult participants with hypoxaemia in the peri-operative/periprocedural period. The literature search strategy was developed by a Cochrane Anaesthesia and Intensive Care trial search specialist in close collaboration with the panel members and the ESA group methodologist. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to assess the level of evidence and to grade recommendations. The final process was then validated by both ESA and ESICM scientific committees. Among 19 recommendations, the two grade 1B recommendations state that: in the peri-operative/periprocedural hypoxaemic patient, the use of either NIPPV or CPAP (based on local expertise) is preferred to COT for improvement of oxygenation; and that the panel suggests using NIPPV or CPAP immediately post-extubation for hypoxaemic patients at risk of developing acute respiratory failure after abdominal surgery.

Anemia of prematurity and cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy: should transfusion thresholds in preterm infants be revised?

OBJECTIVE To determine the impact of progressive anemia of prematurity on cerebral regional saturation (C-rSO2) in preterm infants and identify the hemoglobin threshold below which a critical decrease (>2SD below the mean) in C-rSO2 occurs. STUDY DESIGN In a cohort of infants born ≤30 weeks EGA, weekly C-rSO2 data were prospectively collected from the second week of life through 36 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA). Clinically obtained hemoglobin values were noted at the time of recording. Recordings were excluded if they were of insufficient duration (<1 h) or if the hemoglobin was not measured within 7 days. Statistical analysis was performed using a linear mixed effects-model and ROC analysis. ROC analysis was used to determine the threshold of anemia, where C-rSO2 critically decreased >2SD below the mean normative value (<55%) in preterm infants. RESULTS In total 253 recordings from 68 infants (mean EGA 26.9 ± 2.1 weeks, BW 1025 ± 287 g, 49% male) were included. Approximately 29 out of 68 infants (43%) were transfused during hospitalization. Mixed-model statistical analysis adjusting for EGA, BW, and PMA revealed a significant association between decreasing hemoglobin and C-rSO2 (p < 0.01) in transfusion-naive infants but not in transfused infants. In the transfusion naive group, using ROC analysis demonstrated a threshold hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL (AUC 0.81, p < 0.01) for critical cerebral desaturation in preterm infants. CONCLUSIONS In transfusion-naive preterm infants, worsening anemia was associated with a progressive decrease in cerebral saturations. Analysis identified a threshold hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL below which C-rSO2 dropped >2SD below the mean.

Development of a real-time RT-PCR for the detection of Swine-lineage Influenza A (H1N1) virus infections

Abstract Background A novel influenza A virus, subtype H1N1 of swine-lineage (H1N1 swl) has transmitted rapidly to many regions of the world with evidence of sustained transmission within some countries. Rapid detection and differentiation from seasonal influenza is essential to instigate appropriate patient and public health management and for disease surveillance. Objectives To develop a rapid and sensitive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) for confirmation of H1N1 swl. Study design A one-step rtRT-PCR approach was employed to target the matrix gene of the novel influenza A/H1N1 swl and validated against a panel of seasonal influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), swine influenza A/H1N1 and avian influenza A/H5N1 viruses. The assay following validation was then used prospectively to detect H1N1 swl positive specimens from the recent outbreaks in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Results The one-step H1N1 swl matrix rtRT-PCR successfully detected H1N1 swl clinical specimens and did not cross-react with seasonal influenza A, subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and swine influenza A (H1N1). The H1N1 swl matrix assay did cross react with H5N1. The H1N1 swl matrix assay was then compared to two other assays using a dilution series and a panel of untyped influenza A positive clinical samples. These experiments found the assay to have a comparable sensitivity to the established universal influenza A rtRT-PCR and was more sensitive than the H1N1 swl specific assay that targeted the H1 region. Conclusions The results demonstrate that the rtRT-PCR is sensitive and should be used alongside existing universal influenza A assays to rapidly detect the novel H1N1 swl virus.

A prospective clinical study of detailed neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a virus pandemic. According to the first obtained data, COVID-19 has defined with findings such as cough, fever, diarrhea, and fatigue although neurological symptoms of patients with COVID-19 have not been investigated in detail. This study aims to investigate the neurological findings via obtained face-to-face anamnesis and detailed neurological examination in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Two hundred thirty-nine consecutive inpatients with COVID-19, supported with laboratory tests, were evaluated. Detailed neurological examinations and evaluations of all patients were performed. All evaluations and examinations were performed by two neurologists who have at least five-year experience. RESULTS: This study was carried out 239 patients (133 male + 106 female) with diagnosed COVID-19. Neurological findings were present in 83 of 239 patients (34.7%). The most common neurological finding was a headache (27.6%). D-dimer blood levels were detected to be significantly higher in patients with at least one neurological symptom than patients without the neurological symptom (p < 0.05). IL-6 level was found to be significantly higher in patients with headache than without headache (p < 0.05). Creatine kinase (CK) level was detected to be significantly higher in patients with muscle pain (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Neurological symptoms are often seen in patients with COVID-19. Headache was the most common seen neurological symptom in this disease. Dizziness, impaired consciousness, smell and gustation impairments, cerebrovascular disorders, epileptic seizures, and myalgia were detected as other findings apart from the headache. It is suggested that determining these neurological symptoms prevents the diagnosis delay and helps to prohibit virus spread.

Model based approach for estimating the dosage regimen of indomethacin a potential antiviral treatment of patients infected with SARS CoV-2

To face SARS-CoV-2 pandemic various attempts are made to identify potential effective treatments by repurposing available drugs. Among them, indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory drug, was shown to have potent in-vitro antiviral properties on human SARS-CoV-1, canine CCoV, and more recently on human SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar range. Our objective was to show that indomethacin could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and to provide criteria for comparing benefits of alternative dosage regimens using a model-based approach. A multi-stage model-based approach was developed to characterize % of recovery and viral load in CCoV-infected dogs, to estimate the PK of indomethacin in dog and human using published data after administration of immediate (IR) and sustained-release (SR) formulations, and to estimate the expected antiviral activity as a function of different assumptions on the effective exposure in human. Different dosage regimens were evaluated for IR formulation (25 mg and 50 mg three-times-a-day, and 25 mg four-times-a-day), and SR formulation (75 mg once and twice-a-day). The best performing dosing regimens were: 50 mg three-times-a-day for the IR formulation, and 75 mg twice-a-day for the SR formulation. The treatment with the SR formulation at the dose of 75 mg twice-a-day is expected to achieve a complete response in three days for the treatment in patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. These results suggest that indomethacin could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 whose potential therapeutic effect need to be further assessed in a prospective clinical trial.

Epidemiology of acute febrile illness in Latin America

Abstract Background The causes of acute febrile illness (AFI) in Latin America are diverse and their complexity increases as the proportion of fever due to malaria decreases, as malaria control measures and new pathogens emerge in the region. In this context, it is important to shed light on the gaps in the epidemiological characteristics and the geographic range for many AFI aetiologies. Objectives To review studies on community-acquired fever aetiology other than malaria in Latin America, and to highlight knowledge gaps and challenges needing further investigation. Sources PubMed from 2012 to April 2018. Content We found 17 eligible studies describing 13 539 patients. The median number of pathogens tested per individual was 3.5 (range 2–17). A causative pathogen could be determined for 6661 (49.2%) individuals. The most frequently reported pathogen during the study periods was dengue virus (DENV) (14 studies), followed by chikungunya virus (nine studies) and Zika virus (seven studies). Among the studies reporting concurrent infections, 296 individuals (2.2%) were found to have co-infections. In-hospital mortality was reported in eight (47%) studies, ranging between 0% and 18%. Implications DENV fever is the febrile illness most frequently reported, reflecting its importance, while chikungunya and zika viruses present increasing trends since their emergence in the region. Studies with systematic and harmonized approaches for detection of multiple pathogens are needed and would probably reveal a higher burden of neglected pathogens such as Rickettsia spp. and arenaviruses. The lack of point-of-care tests and harmonized approach limits the care provided by health professionals and the efficacy of surveillance for AFI in the region.

Outcomes of Prophylactic Pantoprazole in Adult Intensive Care Unit Patients Receiving Dialysis: Results of a Randomized Trial.

BACKGROUND Intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) are considered at high risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) is often prescribed. We aimed to assess the incidence of GI bleeding and effects of SUP in these patients. METHODS We assessed GI bleeding in ICU patients receiving RRT at baseline (and at any time in the ICU) and effects of prophylactic pantoprazole versus placebo in the international SUP in the ICU (SUP-ICU) trial. All analyses were conducted according to a published protocol and statistical analysis plan. RESULTS Data of 3,291 acutely admitted adult ICU patients with one or more risk factors for GI bleeding randomized to pantoprazole or placebo intravenously once daily during ICU stay (until ICU discharge, death, or a maximum of 90 days) were analyzed. Some 20 out of 258 (7.8%, 95% CI 4.5-11.1%) and 52 out of 568 (9.2%, 95% CI 6.8-11.6%) of the patients receiving RRT at baseline and at any time in ICU, respectively, developed clinically important GI bleeding in the ICU. We did not observe statistically significant differences in the intervention effect (pantoprazole vs. placebo) in the proportion of patients with clinically important GI bleeding, clinically important events, infectious adverse events, use of interventions to stop GI bleeding, or 90-day mortality in patients with versus without RRT at baseline. CONCLUSIONS In adult ICU patients receiving RRT at baseline, we observed high incidences of clinically important GI bleeding, but did not observe effects of pantoprazole versus placebo in this subgroup.

Spot urine samples to estimate 24-hour urinary calcium excretion in school-age children.

Urinary calcium/creatinine ratio (UCa/Cr) on a single spot urine sample is frequently used in children to evaluate calciuria, but its accuracy to estimate 24-h urinary calcium excretion (24hUCa) has not been properly assessed. We analyzed the correlation between UCa/Cr in various spot samples and 24hUCa among healthy children. A 24-h urine specimen and three spot urine samples (evening, first, and second morning) were collected in a convenience sample of children aged 6 to 16 years (n = 101). Measured 24hUCa was compared with UCa/Cr in each of the three spot samples. The ability of UCa/Cr to discriminate between children with and without hypercalciuria (calciuria > 4 mg/kg/24 h, 1 mmol/kg/24 h) and optimal timing of the spot sample were determined. Eighty-five children completed an adequate 24-h urine collection. Pearson correlation coefficients between the UCa/Cr on the spot sample and 24hUCa were 0.64, 0.71, and 0.52 for the evening, first, and second morning spot samples, respectively. Areas under the ROC curve were 0.90, 0.82, and 0.75, respectively, for the corresponding spot samples.Conclusion: The relatively strong correlation between 24hUCa and UCa/Cr in evening and first morning spot urine samples suggests that these spots could be preferred in clinical practice.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02900261, date of trial registration 14 September 2016.What is Known:•Urinary calcium/creatinine ratio on a single spot urine sample is frequently used as a proxy for 24-h urinary calcium excretion.•Correlation of these indicators, including the best timing for spot urine sampling, has not been properly assessed.What is New:•Relatively strong correlations were found between the calcium/creatinine ratio on a single spot urine sample and 24-h urinary calcium excretion in healthy children.•Evening and first morning spot samples had the highest correlation.

Evolution of CT findings in patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia

OBJECTIVES: To delineate the evolution of CT findings in patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: CT images and medical records of 88 patients with confirmed mild COVID-19 pneumonia, a baseline CT, and at least one follow-up CT were retrospectively reviewed. CT features including lobar distribution and presence of ground glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, and linear opacities were analyzed on per-patient basis during each of five time intervals spanning the 3 weeks after disease onset. Total severity scores were calculated. RESULTS: Of patients, 85.2% had travel history to Wuhan or known contact with infected individuals. The most common symptoms were fever (84.1%) and cough (56.8%). The baseline CT was obtained on average 5 days from symptom onset. Four patients (4.5%) had negative initial CT. Significant differences were found among the time intervals in the proportion of pulmonary lesions that are (1) pure GGO, (2) mixed attenuation, (3) mixed attenuation with linear opacities, (4) consolidation with linear opacities, and (5) pure consolidation. The majority of patients had involvement of &#8805; 3 lobes. Bilateral involvement was more prevalent than unilateral involvement. The proportions of patients observed to have pure GGO or GGO and consolidation decreased over time while the proportion of patients with GGO and linear opacities increased. Total severity score showed an increasing trend in the first 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: While bilateral GGO are predominant features, CT findings changed during different time intervals in the 3 weeks after symptom onset in patients with COVID-19. KEY POINTS: â¢ Four of 88 (4.5%) patients with COVID-19 had negative initial CT. â¢ Majority of COVID-19 patients had abnormal CT findings in &#8805; 3 lobes. â¢ A proportion of patients with pure ground glass opacities decreased over the 3 weeks after symptom onset.

Laparoscopic surgery reduces the incidence of surgical site infections compared to the open approach for colorectal procedures: a meta-analysis

BACKGROUND: Surgical site infections (SSI) are the commonest healthcare associated infections. They severely compromise patient safety, are a significant burden on healthcare resources and have an adverse impact on patient quality of life. The incidence of SSIs can be as high as 10% after colorectal procedures. The laparoscopic approach is being increasingly used to undertake colorectal procedures. It provides advantages over the traditional open approach with smaller incisions, shorter hospital stay and equal oncological outcomes. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate whether the laparoscopic approach for colorectal procedures reduces the incidence of SSI compared to the open approach. METHODS: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the two approaches published since 2000 were included in the review. Revman 5.3 software was used to carry out the review. Data were pooled and the results were shown as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals using the fixed effects model. RESULTS: Sixteen RCT’s were included in the analysis comprising 5797 patients. These covered a range of colorectal pathologies including colon cancer, rectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome. Analysis showed significantly lower wound infection rates (RR: 0.72, 95% confidence interval: 0.60–0.88, p = 0.001) and lower abdominal abscess rates (RR: 0.88, 95% CI 0.62–1.27, p = 0.51). The combined SSI rate was significantly lower in laparoscopic compared to open surgery (RR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.64–0.90, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic colorectal surgery significantly lowers the incidence of SSI compared to open surgery.

COVID-19 and paediatric health services: A survey of paediatric physicians in Australia and New Zealand

AIMS: COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. At the time of survey, fewer than 150 children in Australia and New Zealand had documented infection. The aim of this study was to assess attitudes, readiness and confidence in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic through an online survey of paediatric physicians and sub-specialists across Australia and New Zealand. METHODS: Multiple email list groups were used to contact paediatric physicians to undertake an online Likert scale survey between 17 and 24 March. Respondents' specialty, experience and work setting were recorded. Ordinal logistic regression was used to determine respondent factors. RESULTS: There were 542 respondents from across Australia and New Zealand: an estimated 11% of the paediatric physician workforce. A minority (36.6%) agreed that their national response had been well coordinated; the majority (92.7%) agreed that senior-level hospital administrators were taking the situation seriously. Most reported a good understanding of the natural history of COVID-19 in children, and knowledge of where to find local information. A large proportion of physicians (86.1%) were worried about becoming infected through their work; few (5.8%) reported that they would not come to work to avoid infection. Closure of school and childcares would reduce the ability to continue work at current capacity for 23.6% of respondents. CONCLUSION: Despite limited experience in pandemics, most paediatric physicians felt informed. Concern about exposure at work is common; most were willing to work regardless. The closure of schools and daycares may have an impact on staffing. Coordination and leadership will be critical.

[Theory and practice of aging upon COVID-19 pandemic.]

Never before in history, aging was such a significant factor for epidemics as it is now for the current COVID-19 pandemic, which features a drastic shift of mortality towards older ages. Our analysis of data on COVID-19-related mortality in Spain, Italy, and Sweden has shown that, in the range of 30 to 90 years of age, each dependency of the logarithm of mortality upon age is linear, and all regression lines are strictly parallel to those related to the total mortality in accordance with the Gompertz law. In all cases, irrespective of the stage and place of epidemic, mortality doubling time in this age range is close to 7,5 years. The rates of being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and of being diagnosed due to the symptomatic manifestations of the infection are dependent on age to a far lesser degree. With account for these observations, three messages are put forth: 1) Older persons are the principal victims of both SARS-CoV-2 and measures undertaken to control its spread; 2) Older persons are not the principal driving force of SARS-CoV-2 spread; 3) Older persons can and should be engaged in combating the pandemic and its consequences; however, not via selective social distancing and other discriminative measures. People aged over 65 years constitute a significant part of the current population. They have specific interests and needs, which deserve no less respect than those of any other age group. This includes the right for the quality of life that remains sustained under the emergency conditions. Since the prospects for controlling the SARS-CoV-2 are dubious, those in charge of decisions concerning «people aged above 65» should mind that currently, unlike in the medieval ages, 65+ is the individual future of almost everyone.

Tocilizumab and steroid treatment in patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia.

Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can lead to respiratory failure due to severe immune response. Treatment targeting this immune response might be beneficial but there is limited evidence on its efficacy. The aim of this study was to determine if early treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with tocilizumab and/or steroids was associated with better outcome. Methods This observational single-center study included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were not intubated and received either standard of care (SOC, controls) or SOC plus early (within 3 days from hospital admission) anti-inflammatory treatment. SOC consisted of hydroxychloroquine 400mg bid plus, in those admitted before March 24th, also darunavir/ritonavir. Anti-inflammatory treatment consisted of either tocilizumab (8mg/kg intravenously or 162mg subcutaneously) or methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg for 5 days or both. Failure was defined as intubation or death, and the endpoints were failure-free survival (primary endpoint) and overall survival (secondary) at day 30. Difference between the groups was estimated as Hazard Ratio by a propensity score weighted Cox regression analysis (HROW). Results Overall, 196 adults were included in the analyses. They were mainly male (67.4%), with comorbidities (78.1%) and severe COVID-19 pneumonia (83.7%). Median age was 67.9 years (range, 30-100) and median PaO2/FiO2 200 mmHg (IQR 133-289). Among them, 130 received early anti-inflammatory treatment with: tocilizumab (n=29, 22.3%), methylprednisolone (n=45, 34.6%), or both (n=56, 43.1%). The adjusted failure-free survival among tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC treated patients vs. SOC was 80.8% (95%CI, 72.8-86.7) vs. 64.1% (95%CI, 51.3-74.0), HROW 0.48, 95%CI, 0.23-0.99; p=0.049. The overall survival among tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC patients vs. SOC was 85.9% (95%CI, 80.7-92.6) vs. 71.9% (95%CI, 46-73), HROW 0.41, 95%CI: 0.19-0.89, p=0.025. Conclusion Early adjunctive treatment with tocilizumab, methylprednisolone or both may improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Prognostic factors of in-hospital complications after hip fracture surgery: a scoping review.

INTRODUCTION To examine prognostic factors that influence complications after hip fracture surgery. To summarize proposed underlying mechanisms for their influence. METHODS We reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Scoping Review extension. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AgeLine, Cochrane Library, and reference lists of retrieved studies for studies of prognostic factor/s of postoperative in-hospital medical complication/s among patients 50 years and older treated surgically for non-pathological closed hip fracture, published in English on January 2008-January 2018. We excluded studies of surgery type or in-hospital medications. Screening was duplicated by two independent reviewers. One reviewer completed the extraction with accuracy checks by the second reviewer. We summarized the extent, nature, and proposed underlying mechanisms for the prognostic factors of complications narratively and in a dependency graph. RESULTS We identified 44 prognostic factors of in-hospital complications after hip fracture surgery from 56 studies. Of these, we identified 7 patient factors-dehydration, anemia, hypotension, heart rate variability, pressure risk, nutrition, and indwelling catheter use; and 7 process factors-time to surgery, anesthetic type, transfusion strategy, orthopedic versus geriatric/co-managed care, multidisciplinary care pathway, and potentially modifiable during index hospitalization. We identified underlying mechanisms for 15 of 44 factors. The reported association between 12 prognostic factors and complications was inconsistent across studies. CONCLUSIONS Most factors were reported by one study with no proposed underlying mechanism for their influence. Where reported by more than one study, there was inconsistency in reported associations and the conceptualization of complications differed, limiting comparison across studies. It is therefore not possible to be certain whether intervening on these factors would reduce the rate of complications after hip fracture surgery.

Multidisciplinary approach to evaluating welfare of veal calves in commercial facilities

Due to pending legislation and public concerns, a multidisciplinary approach was designed to investigate the welfare of special-fed veal calves in commercial veal facilities. Concerns included housing conditions, dietary regimens, management practices, and behavioral aspects imposed on special-fed calves. Four categories of parameters including environment and housing, nutrition, health and stress, and behavior provided a broad base of evaluating veal systems. Observations and samples were collected on 550 Holstein bull calves located in 10 commercial veal facilities. Each facility was visited to collect data during wk 0 (week of arrival of the calves), 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16. Nine facilities used individual stalls 48 to 55 cm in width with tethers attached to the front of the stalls. One facility housed 30 calves in group pens after obtaining calves at 8 wk of age. Ammonia, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide gas did not exceed the permissible limit for humans in any facility. All facilities exceeded the 2-foot-candle recommendation for lighting. The average daily gain of calves was .85 kg during wk 0 to 8 and 1.18 kg during wk 8 to 16. Dietary iron levels decreased from 209 ppm at wk 0 to 32 ppm at wk 16. At 16 wk, 25% of calves were marginally anemic and 10% clinically anemic. Overall mortality was 4.2%. Stress indices such as plasma Cortisol concentrations or neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios declined as calves approached market weight. In either pens or stalls, calves spent approximately 25 and 75% of time in standing and lying positions, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Bridging complexity theory and resilience to develop surge capacity in health systems.

Purpose Health systems are periodically confronted by crises - think of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, H1N1, and Ebola - during which they are called upon to manage exceptional situations without interrupting essential services to the population. The ability to accomplish this dual mandate is at the heart of resilience strategies, which in healthcare systems involve developing surge capacity to manage a sudden influx of patients. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach This paper relates insights from resilience research to the four "S" of surge capacity (staff, stuff, structures and systems) and proposes a framework based on complexity theory to better understand and assess resilience factors that enable the development of surge capacity in complex health systems. Findings Detailed and dynamic complexities manifest in different challenges during a crisis. Resilience factors are classified according to these types of complexity and along their temporal dimensions: proactive factors that improve preparedness to confront both usual and exceptional requirements, and passive factors that enable response to unexpected demands as they arise during a crisis. The framework is completed by further categorizing resilience factors according to their stabilizing or destabilizing impact, drawing on feedback processes described in complexity theory. Favorable order resilience factors create consistency and act as stabilizing forces in systems, while favorable disorder factors such as diversity and complementarity act as destabilizing forces. Originality/value The framework suggests a balanced and innovative process to integrate these factors in a pragmatic approach built around the fours "S" of surge capacity to increase health system resilience.

Frequent detection of human rhinoviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, and bocavirus during acute respiratory tract infections

Viruses are the major cause of pediatric acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) and yet many suspected cases of infection remain uncharacterized. We employed 17 PCR assays and retrospectively screened 315 specimens selected by season from a predominantly pediatric hospital‐based population. Before the Brisbane respiratory virus research study commenced, one or more predominantly viral pathogens had been detected in 15.2% (n = 48) of all specimens. The Brisbane study made an additional 206 viral detections, resulting in the identification of a microbe in 67.0% of specimens. After our study, the majority of microbes detected were RNA viruses (89.9%). Overall, human rhinoviruses (HRVs) were the most frequently identified target (n = 140) followed by human adenoviruses (HAdVs; n = 25), human metapneumovirus (HMPV; n = 18), human bocavirus (HBoV; n = 15), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV; n = 12), human coronaviruses (HCoVs; n = 11), and human herpesvirus‐6 (n = 11). HRVs were the sole microbe detected in 37.8% (n = 31) of patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Genotyping of the HRV VP4/VP2 region resulted in a proposed subdivision of HRV type A into sublineages A1 and A2. Most of the genotyped HAdV strains were found to be type C. This study describes the high microbial burden imposed by HRVs, HMPV, HRSV, HCoVs, and the newly identified virus, HBoV on a predominantly paediatric hospital population with suspected acute respiratory tract infections and proposes a new formulation of viral targets for future diagnostic research studies.

The role of the orthopaedic surgeon in the COVID-19 era: cautions and perspectives

The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has revolutionized global healthcare in an unprecedented way and with unimaginable repercussions. Resource reallocation, socioeconomic confinement and reorganization of production activities are current challenges being faced both at the national and international levels, in a frame of uncertainty and fear. Hospitals have been restructured to provide the best care to COVID-19 patients while adopting preventive strategies not to spread the infection among healthcare providers and patients affected by other diseases. As a consequence, the concept of urgency and indications for elective treatments have been profoundly reshaped. In addition, several providers have been recruited in COVID-19 departments despite their original occupation, resulting in a profound rearrangement of both inpatient and outpatient care. Orthopaedic daily practice has been significantly affected by the pandemic. Surgical indications have been reformulated, with elective cases being promptly postponed and urgent interventions requiring exceptional attention, especially in suspected or COVID-19(+) patients. This has made a strong impact on inpatient management, with the need of a dedicated staff, patient isolation and restrictive visiting hour policies. On the other hand, outpatient visits have been limited to reduce contacts between patients and the hospital personnel, with considerable consequences on post-operative quality of care and the human side of medical practice. In this review, we aim to analyze the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the orthopaedic practice. Particular attention will be dedicated to opportune surgical indication, perioperative care and safe management of both inpatients and outpatients, also considering repercussions of the pandemic on resident education and ethical implications.

Etiology and Clinical Characteristics of Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) in Outpatients in Beijing, June 2010 to May 2011

BACKGROUND: Since May 2009, exposure of the population of Beijing, China to pH1N1 has resulted in an increase in respiratory illnesses. Limited information is available on the etiology and clinical characteristics of the influenza-like illness (ILI) that ensued in adults following the pH1N1 pandemic. METHODS: Clinical and epidemiological data of ILI in adults was collected. A total of 279 throat swabs were tested for twelve respiratory viruses using multiplex RT-PCR. Clinical characteristics of influenza A in outpatients versus test-negative patients were compared using Pearson's χ2 and the Mann-Whitney U test. 190 swabs were tested for pH1N1 by virus isolation. Consultation rates for ILI were compared between 2009 and 2010. RESULTS: One or two virus were detected in 29% of the samples. Influenza A virus (FLU-A) accounted for 22.9% (64/279). Other viruses were present at a frequency less than 3.0%. Cough was significantly associated with Influenza A virus infection (χ2, p<0.001). The positive rate of FLU-A was consistent with changes in the ILI rate during the same period and there was a significant reduction in the incidence of ILI in 2010 when compared to 2009. During the 2010–2011 influenza season, the incidence peaked in January 2011 in Beijing and north China. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to pH1N1 had no impact on typical influenza seasonal peaks, although FLU-A remained the predominant virus for 2010 in Beijing. Symptomatically, cough was associated with FLU-A infection. The positive rate of influenza virus was consistent with changes in the ILI rate during the same period and there was a significant reduction in the incidence of ILI in 2010 when compared to that of 2009.

Longer stent retrievers enhance thrombectomy performance in acute stroke.

BACKGROUND Longer stent retrievers have recently become available and have theoretical advantages over their shorter counterparts. We aim to evaluate whether stent retriever length impacts reperfusion rates in stroke thrombectomy. METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected thrombectomy database in which equal diameter (4 mm) stent retrievers were used as the first-line strategy for intracranial internal carotid or middle cerebral artery M1 or M2 occlusions along with a balloon guide catheter from June 2011 to March 2017. The population was dichotomized into long (Trevo 4×30 mm/Solitaire 4×40 mm) or short (Trevo 4×20 mm/Solitaire 4×20 mm) retrievers. The primary outcome was first-pass modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) 2b/3 reperfusion. RESULTS Of 1126 thrombectomies performed within the study period, 420 were included. Age, gender, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, ASPECTS, IV tissue plasminogen activator use, stroke etiology, occlusion site, time from last-known-normal to puncture, distribution of Trevo and Solitaire, and the use of newer generation local thromboaspiration devices were comparable between the long and short retrievers. The short retriever group had more frequent hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. First-pass mTICI 2b/3 reperfusion was more common in the long retriever group (62% vs 50%; P=0.01). Parenchymal hematomas type 2, subarachnoid hemorrhage, 90-day modified Rankin Scale score 0-2, and mortality were comparable. Multivariable analysis indicated that long retriever (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.3 to 3.6; P=0.001), radiopaque device (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2 to 3.4; P=0.003), and adjuvant local aspiration (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.3 to 4.3; P=0.003) were independently associated with first-pass reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS The use of longer stent retrievers is an independent predictor of first-pass mTICI 2b/3 reperfusion. First-pass reperfusion was also associated with the use of radiopaque devices and adjuvant local aspiration.

The Chest CT Features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China: A Meta-analysis of 19 Trials

Objective: This study aimed to summarize the characteristics of chest CT imaging in Chinese patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) to provide reliable evidence for further guiding clinical routine. Methods: PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases were thoroughly searched to identified relevant articles involving the features of chest CT imaging in Chinese patients with COVID-19. All data were analyzed utilizing R software version i386 4.0.0. Random-effects models were employed to calculate pooled mean differences. Results: 19 trials incorporating 1332 cases were included in the study. The results demonstrated that the incidence of ground-glass opacities (GGO) was 0.79, consolidation was 0.34; mixed GGO and consolidation was 0.46; air bronchogram sign was 0.41; crazy paving pattern was 0.32; interlobular septal thickening was 0.55; reticulation was 0.30; bronchial wall thickening was 0.24; vascular enlargement was 0.74. subpleural linear opacity was 0.28; intrathoracic lymph node enlargement was 0.03; pleural effusions was 0.03. The distribution in lung: the incidence of central was 0.05; peripheral was 0.74; peripheral involving central was 0.38; diffuse was 0.19; unifocal involvement was 0.09; multifocal involvement was 0.57; unilateral was 0.16; bilateral was 0.83; The incidence of lobes involved (>2) was 0.70; lobes involved ([less double equals]2) was 0.35. Conclusion: GGO, vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening more frequently occurred in patients with COVID-19. Peripheral, bilateral, involved lobes >2 might be the features of COVID-19 in the distribution aspect. Therefore, based on the aboved features of COVID-19 in chest CT imaging, it might be a promising means for identifying COVID-19.

COVID-19 lockdown: if, when and how

Background: With the lack of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, mathematical modeling has stepped up in the COVID-19 management to guide non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) policies. Complete lockdown has been characterized as the most powerful strategy for the epidemic; anyhow, it is associated with undeniable negative consequences. Not aware that global panic could make countries adopt premature and lengthy lockdowns, previous studies only warned about the inefficacy of late quarantine sets. Therefore, we proposed ourselves to find the optimal timing and lasting for COVID-19 suppressive measures. Methods: We used our previously elaborated compartmental SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model to scan different timings for lockdown set and various lockdown lengths under different reproduction number (R0) scenarios. We explored healthcare parameters focusing on ICU occupation and deaths since they condition the sanitary system and reflect the severity of the epidemic. Results: The timing for the lockdown trigger varies according to the original R0 and has great impact on ICU usage and fatalities. The less the R0 the later the lockdown should be for it to be effective. The lockdown length is also something to consider. Too short lockdowns (~15 days) have minimal effect on healthcare parameters, but too long quarantines (>45 days) do not benefit healthcare parameters proportionally when compared to more reasonable 30 to 45-day lockdowns. We explored the outcome of the combination of a 45-day lockdown followed by strict mitigation measures sustained in time, and interestingly, it outperformed the lengthy quarantine. Additionally, we show that if strict mitigation actions were to be installed from the very beginning of the epidemic, lockdown would not benefit substantially regarding healthcare parameters. Conclusion: Lockdown set timing and lasting are non-trivial variables to COVID-19 management.

The Study of Viral RNA Diversity in Bird Samples Using De Novo Designed Multiplex Genus-Specific Primer Panels

Advances in the next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have significantly increased our ability to detect new viral pathogens and systematically determine the spectrum of viruses prevalent in various biological samples. In addition, this approach has also helped in establishing the associations of viromes with many diseases. However, unlike the metagenomic studies using 16S rRNA for the detection of bacteria, it is impossible to create universal oligonucleotides to target all known and novel viruses, owing to their genomic diversity and variability. On the other hand, sequencing the entire genome is still expensive and has relatively low sensitivity for such applications. The existing approaches for the design of oligonucleotides for targeted enrichment are usually involved in the development of primers for the PCR-based detection of particular viral species or genera, but not for families or higher taxonomic orders. In this study, we have developed a computational pipeline for designing the oligonucleotides capable of covering a significant number of known viruses within various taxonomic orders, as well as their novel variants. We have subsequently designed a genus-specific oligonucleotide panel for targeted enrichment of viral nucleic acids in biological material and demonstrated the possibility of its application for virus detection in bird samples. We have tested our panel using a number of collected samples and have observed superior efficiency in the detection and identification of viral pathogens. Since a reliable, bioinformatics-based analytical method for the rapid identification of the sequences was crucial, an NGS-based data analysis module was developed in this study, and its functionality in the detection of novel viruses and analysis of virome diversity was demonstrated.

Synergy of IL-27 and TNF-α in regulating CXCL10 expression in lung fibroblasts.

IL-27 is involved in inflammatory reactions. CXCL10 is an important chemokine contributing to airway inflammatory disease. In this study, we investigated whether IL-27 modulated the synthesis of CXCL10 in primary human lung fibroblasts (HLFs). HLFs were activated by IL-27 alone, or in combination with other cytokines. CXCL10 synthesis was measured by real-time PCR and ELISA. An examination of transcriptional regulation was performed via the transient transfection of promoter constructs, whereas mRNA stability was assessed by actinomycin D chase and real-time PCR. The underlying signaling pathways were studied by Western blotting and intracellular staining, using flow cytometry. Our results demonstrated that IL-27 induced and synergized with TNF-α to up-regulate CXCL10 mRNA and protein concentrations in a steroid-insensitive manner. This synergistic CXCL10 production was dependent on the transcriptional regulation of CXCL10 gene promoter activity and the enhanced stability of CXCL10 mRNA because of IL-27 and TNF-α, and this synergism was regulated by the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K)-Akt dominantly, and in small part via NF-κB. Interestingly, IL-27 promoted the basal and enhanced TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and Akt, but not IκBα. Moreover, enhanced CXCL10 mRNA stability occurred via a p38 MAPK-dependent pathway. Finally, clinical analysis showed that IL-27 was detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage of patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and increased IL-27 concentrations were correlated with increased CXCL10 concentrations in patients with COPD and PTB. Our findings suggest that IL-27 has the potential to amplify airway inflammation via the induction of CXCL10 from HLFs, in combination with TNF-α.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome among children.

OBJECTIVE To study the epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features, prognostic indicators, and short-term to medium-term outcomes for children with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and to validate the performance characteristics of a clinical case definition, calculated with respect to SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) seroconversion. METHODS Children <18 years of age, from a single-site outbreak, who satisfied a clinical case definition for SARS, with subsequent serologic confirmation, were treated according to a standard protocol and prospectively monitored. RESULTS Forty-four children were included. The median age was 12 years. Forty-two children (95.5%) demonstrated an epidemiologic link. Fever, cough, malaise, coryza, sputum production, headache, myalgia, lymphopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels were common presenting features. Radiographic findings were nonspecific, but high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax was an early diagnostic aid. A specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-CoV yielded positive results for <50% of children. Of 9 children who developed hypoxemia, 8 were treated with methylprednisolone. Of 5 children who received intensive care, 3 required assisted ventilation. All children recovered, and serious adverse events in response to treatment were not observed. The outcomes at 3 to 6 months after disease onset, including exercise tolerance, pulmonary functions, and psychologic status, were favorable. An age of >12 years was associated with methylprednisolone therapy for severe illness. After exclusion of the only infant, an age of >12 years was associated with oxygen requirements. Sore throat, high neutrophil count at presentation, and peak neutrophilia were independent factors predicting severe illness. The clinical case definition demonstrated good sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (97.8%, 92.7%, 88%, and 98.7%, respectively) for diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSIONS Children are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection. Teenagers resemble adults with respect to disease progression and may develop severe illness. The short-term to medium-term outcomes are good. Sore throat and initial and peak neutrophilia seem to be predictors of severe illness. Our clinical case definition performed well in the epidemic.

Pig trade networks through live pig markets in Guangdong Province, China

This study used social network analysis to investigate the indirect contact network between counties through the movement of live pigs through four wholesale live pig markets in Guangdong Province, China. All 14,118 trade records for January and June 2016 were collected from the markets and the patterns of pig trade in these markets analysed. Maps were developed to show the movement pathways. Evaluating the network between source counties was the primary objective of this study. A 1‐mode network was developed. Characteristics of the trading network were explored, and the degree, betweenness and closeness were calculated for each source county. Models were developed to compare the impacts of different disease control strategies on the potential magnitude of an epidemic spreading through this network. The results show that pigs from 151 counties were delivered to the four wholesale live pig markets in January and/or June 2016. More batches (truckloads of pigs sourced from one or more piggeries) were traded in these markets in January (8,001) than in June 2016 (6,117). The pigs were predominantly sourced from counties inside Guangdong Province (90%), along with counties in Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian and Henan provinces. The major source counties (46 in total) contributed 94% of the total batches during the two‐month study period. Pigs were sourced from piggeries located 10 to 1,417 km from the markets. The distribution of the nodes' degrees in both January and June indicates a free‐scale network property, and the network in January had a higher clustering coefficient (0.54 vs. 0.39) and a shorter average pathway length (1.91 vs. 2.06) than that in June. The most connected counties of the network were in the central, northern and western regions of Guangdong Province. Compared with randomly removing counties from the network, eliminating counties with higher betweenness, degree or closeness resulted in a greater reduction of the magnitude of a potential epidemic. The findings of this study can be used to inform targeted control interventions for disease spread through this live pig market trade network in south China.

Cognitive Fatigability Interventions in Neurological Conditions: A Systematic Review.

INTRODUCTION Although fatigue is a well-studied concept in neurological disease, cognitive fatigability (CF) is less understood. While most studies measure fatigue using subjective self-report, fewer have measured CF objectively. Given the negative impact of CF on quality-of-life, there is a need for targeted interventions. The objective of this review was to determine which procedural, behavioural and pharmacological treatments for objectively measured CF are available to people living with neurological conditions. METHODS In accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, systematic searches for randomized control trials (RCTs), case-controlled studies and case reports/series were conducted across the Ovid Medline, PsycInfo, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases. English-language articles published between 1980 and February 2019 were considered for eligibility. Included were those that objectively measured CF in individuals with neurological disease/disorder/dysfunction between the ages of 18 and 65 years. Studies were reviewed using a modified Cochrane Data Extraction Template. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The review process was facilitated using Covidence software ( www.covidence.org ). Two authors reviewed articles independently, with a third resolving conflicts regarding article inclusion. RESULTS The search identified 450 records. After duplicates were removed and remaining titles/abstracts were screened for eligibility, 28 full-text articles were assessed, and two studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. Studies were a priori divided into those with pharmacological, procedural or behavioural interventions. Two studies met eligibility criteria; both of these included participants with multiple sclerosis. One study utilized a procedural intervention (i.e. transcranial direct current stimulation), while the other utilized a pharmacological intervention (i.e. fampridine-SR). Studies were evaluated for risk of bias, and evidence from both eligible studies was discussed. CONCLUSION Despite the positive results of the procedural intervention, the paucity of eligible studies and the nascent nature of the field suggests that more studies are required before firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the amenability of CF to treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019118706).

Information technology facilitates cost-effectiveness analysis in developing countries: an observational study of breast cancer chemotherapy in Taiwan.

Health information technology offers a powerful tool to monitor the performance of a healthcare system. Advances in computer technology and capacity combined with lower start-up costs will allow developing countries to achieve greater impact when they initiate electronic health information systems. We focused on the integrated health information system that was established in Taiwan in conjunction with the launch of the National Health Insurance (NHI) programme. We used data from that health information system to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of chemotherapy use among breast cancer patients. We then used this analysis to discuss what policy makers can learn from this type of analysis. We identified a cohort of patients in the NHI Research Database who had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2001 and had received chemotherapy following surgical removal of the tumour. We followed these patients for 3 years and conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from the payer's perspective. Using the net benefit regression approach, we compared the cost effectiveness of the two most commonly prescribed first-line chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of breast cancer in 2001 in Taiwan. The dependent variable of the regression model was the individual-level net benefit, and the independent variables included a binary variable indicating the choice of chemotherapy regimen, the patients' age, co-morbidity, type of surgery, geographic region and type of treatment facility. We employed both frequentist and Bayesian approaches in our net benefit regression analyses. In the Bayesian analysis, we applied non-informative priors to all parameters in the base-case analyses. We then explored the use of informative priors in the sensitivity analysis, using cost-effectiveness data published in the literature to form the prior distributions for the relevant parameters. Over 60% of surgically treated breast cancer patients received either CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil) or CEF (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, fluorouracil). A comparison of patient characteristics indicated that patients in the CEF group tended to be younger (47.8 vs 49.1 years; p = 0.016), and were significantly more likely to have undergone a mastectomy (84% vs 76%; p < 0.001) and to have been treated in a teaching hospital (26% vs 13%; p < 0.001). We also observed significant variations in geographic region of the location of facilities between treatment groups. On average, CEF was not cost effective in the treatment of patients with breast cancer in Taiwan, although analyses stratified by geographic region suggested a wide variation across regions. At a societal willingness to pay (WTP) of new Taiwanese dollar ($NT)1 500 000 ($US80 000), the probability that CEF was more cost effective than CMF was 0.0%, 0.0%, 0.0% and 3.9% for the Taipei metropolitan area, and the north, middle and the combined south and east region, respectively; the probability became 0.6%, 0.0%, 1.3% and 54.5%, respectively, at a WTP of $NT5 000 000 ($US270 000). After co-variate adjustments, the probabilities were 0.0%, 0.0%, 0.0% and 0.8%, respectively at a WTP of $NT1 500 000, and were 0.0%, 0.0%, 1.4% and 34.7% at $NT5 000 000. Sensitivity analyses showed that CEF potentially could have been more cost effective than CMF within a reasonable range of societal WTP (i.e. $NT1 000 000-3 000 000 or $US55 000-160 000) had the optimal dosage level for CEF been established for breast cancer patients in Taiwan. A population-based, fully integrated electronic health information system provides useful data to assess the cost effectiveness of competing treatments and interventions in current practice. This research may potentially inform policy makers of modifications that can be instituted to improve the cost effectiveness of a new therapy. However, findings from this study need to be interpreted with caution because the study provided information only on the short-term cost effectiveness (i.e. 3 years) of CEF compared with CMF. It is possible that a future analysis will reach a different conclusion when more years of follow-up data become available.

AGA White Paper: Training and Implementation of Endoscopic Image Enhancement Technologies.

Endoscopic image-enhancement technologies provide opportunities to visualize normal and abnormal tissues within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in a manner that complements conventional white light endoscopic imaging. The additional information that is obtained enables the endoscopist to better identify, delineate, and characterize lesions and can facilitate targeted biopsies or, in some cases, eliminate the need to send samples for histologic analysis. Some of these technologies have been available for more than a decade, but despite this fact, there is limited use of these technologies by endoscopists. Lack of formalized training in their use and a scarcity of guidelines on implementation of these technologies into clinical practice are contributing factors. In November 2014, the American Gastroenterological Association's Center for GI Innovation and Technology conducted a 2-day workshop to discuss endoscopic image-enhancement technologies. This article represents the third of 3 separate documents generated from the workshop and discusses the published literature pertaining to training and outlines a proposed framework for the implementation of endoscopic image-enhancement technologies in clinical practice. There was general agreement among participants in the workshop on several key considerations. Training and competency assessment for endoscopic image-enhancement technologies should incorporate competency-based education paradigms. To facilitate successful training, multiple different educational models that can cater to variations in learning styles need to be developed, including classroom-style and self-directed programs, in-person and web-based options, image and video atlases, and endoscopic simulator programs. To ensure safe and appropriate use of these technologies over time, refresher courses, skill maintenance programs, and options for competency reassessment should be established. Participants also generally agreed that although early adopters of novel endoscopic image-enhancement modalities can successfully implement these technologies by pursuing training and ensuring self-competency, widespread implementation is likely to require support from GI societies and buy-in from other key stakeholders including payors/purchasers and patients. Continued work by manufacturers and the GI societies in providing training programs and patient education, working with payors and purchasers, and creating environments and policies that motivate endoscopists to adopt new practices is essential in creating widespread implementation.

Lower extremity revascularization using directional atherectomy: 12-month prospective results of the DEFINITIVE LE study.

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of directional atherectomy (DA) for endovascular treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in infrainguinal arteries in patients with claudication or critical limb ischemia. BACKGROUND To date, no prospective, multicenter, independently-adjudicated study has evaluated the effectiveness and durability of DA in the treatment of PAD. Previous DA studies have not been prospectively powered to evaluate any differences in outcomes in patients with and without diabetes. METHODS DEFINITIVE LE (Determination of EFfectiveness of the SilverHawk(®) PerIpheral Plaque ExcisioN System (SIlverHawk Device) for the Treatment of Infrainguinal VEssels / Lower Extremities) prospectively enrolled subjects at 47 multinational centers with an infrainguinal lesion length up to 20 cm. Primary endpoints were defined as primary patency at 12 months for claudicants and freedom from major unplanned amputation for critical limb ischemia (CLI) subjects. A pre-specified statistical hypothesis evaluated noninferiority of primary patency in diabetic versus nondiabetic claudicants. Independent angiographic and sonographic core laboratories assessed outcomes, and events were adjudicated by a clinical events committee. RESULTS A total of 800 subjects were enrolled. The 12-month primary patency was 78% (95% confidence interval: 74.0% to 80.6%) in claudicants, with a 77% rate in the diabetic subgroup versus 78% in the nondiabetic subgroup (noninferior, p < 0.001). The rate of freedom from major unplanned amputation of the target limb at 12 months in CLI subjects was 95% (95% confidence interval: 90.7% to 97.4%). Periprocedural adverse events included embolization (3.8%), perforation (5.3%), and abrupt closure (2.0%). The bail-out stent rate was 3.2%. CONCLUSIONS The DEFINITIVE LE study demonstrated that DA is a safe and effective treatment modality at 12 months for a diverse patient population with either claudication or CLI. Furthermore, DA was shown to be noninferior for treating PAD in patients with diabetes compared with those without diabetes.

New Insights into the Roles of Metalloproteinases in Neurodegeneration and Neuroprotection

Proteolytic enzymes constitute around 2% of the human genome and are involved in many stages of cell development from fertilization to death (apoptosis). The identification of many novel proteases from genome‐sequencing programs has suggested them as potential new therapeutic targets. In addition, several well‐characterized metallopeptidases were recently shown to possess new biological roles in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. As a result of these studies, metabolism of the neurotoxic and inflammatory amyloid peptide (Aβ) is considered as a physiologically relevant process with several metallopeptidases being suggested for the role of amyloid‐degrading enzymes. These include the neprilysin (NEP) family of metalloproteinases (including its homologue endothelin‐converting enzyme), insulin‐degrading enzyme, angiotensin‐converting enzyme, plasmin, and, possibly, some other enzymes. NEP also has a role in metabolism of sensory and inflammatory neuropeptides such as tachykinins and neurokinins. The existence of natural enzymatic mechanisms for removal of amyloid peptides has extended the therapeutic avenues in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neurodegeneration. The proteolytic events underlying AD are highly compartmentalized in the cell and formation of amyloid peptide from its precursor molecule APP (amyloid precursor protein) takes place both within intracellular compartments and in the plasma membrane, especially in lipid raft domains. Degradation of amyloid peptide by metallopeptidases can also be both intra‐ and extracellular depending on the activity of membrane‐bound enzymes and their soluble partners. Soluble forms of proteases can be secreted or released from the cell surface through the activity of “sheddases”—another group of proteolytic enzymes involved in key cellular regulatory functions. The activity of proteases involved in amyloid metabolism depends on numerous factors (e.g., genetic, environmental, age), and some conditions (e.g., hypoxia and ischemia) shift the balance of amyloid metabolism toward accumulation of higher concentrations of Aβ. In this regard, regulation of the activity of amyloid‐degrading enzymes should be considered as a viable strategy in neuroprotection.

Improved labelling of DTPA- and DOTA-conjugated peptides and antibodies with 111In in HEPES and MES buffer.

BACKGROUND In single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT], high specific activity of 111In-labelled tracers will allow administration of low amounts of tracer to prevent receptor saturation and/or side effects. To increase the specific activity, we studied the effect of the buffer used during the labelling procedure: NaAc, NH4Ac, HEPES and MES buffer. The effect of the ageing of the 111InCl3 stock and cadmium contamination, the decay product of 111In, was also examined in these buffers. METHODS Escalating amounts of 111InCl3 were added to 1 μg of the diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid [DTPA]- and 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid [DOTA]-conjugated compounds (exendin-3, octreotide and anti-carbonic anhydrase IX [CAIX] antibody). Five volumes of 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid [MES], 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid [HEPES], NH4Ac or NaAc (0.1 M, pH 5.5) were added. After 20 min at 20°C (DTPA-conjugated compounds), at 95°C (DOTA-exendin-3 and DOTA-octreotide) or at 45°C (DOTA-anti-CAIX antibody), the labelling efficiency was determined by instant thin layer chromatography. The effect of the ageing of the 111InCl3 stock on the labelling efficiency of DTPA-exendin-3 as well as the effect of increasing concentrations of Cd2+ (the decay product of 111In) were also examined. RESULTS Specific activities obtained for DTPA-octreotide and DOTA-anti-CAIX antibody were five times higher in MES and HEPES buffer. Radiolabelling of DTPA-exendin-3, DOTA-exendin-3 and DTPA-anti-CAIX antibody in MES and HEPES buffer resulted in twofold higher specific activities than that in NaAc and NH4Ac. Labelling of DTPA-exendin-3 decreased with 66% and 73% for NaAc and NH4Ac, respectively, at day 11 after the production date of 111InCl3, while for MES and HEPES, the maximal decrease in the specific activity was 10% and 4% at day 11, respectively. The presence of 1 pM Cd2+ in the labelling mixture of DTPA-exendin-3 in NaAc and NH4Ac markedly reduced the labelling efficiency, whereas Cd2+ concentrations up to 0.1 nM did not affect the labelling efficiency in MES and HEPES buffer. CONCLUSIONS We showed improved labelling of DTPA- and DOTA-conjugated compounds with 111In in HEPES and MES buffer. The enhanced labelling efficiency appears to be due to the reduced competitive chelation of cadmium. The enhanced labelling efficiency will allow more sensitive imaging of the biomarkers with SPECT.

Hong Kong Registry Report 2004

This report is based on data (up to 31 March 2004) from the Renal Registry of the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong, and accounts for 90-95% of all patients receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the territory. Patients receiving RRT in the private sector are not included in this report. The number of patients receiving RRT was 6,054 (889 per million population [pmp]), of whom 51.6% (3,123, 451 pmp) were receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD), 10.9% (662, 97 pmp) hemodialysis (HD), and 37.5% (2,269, 334 pmp) had functioning kidney transplants. The net increase from the previous year in the number of patients receiving RRT was 3.1%. The incidence of end-stage renal failure in patients undergoing RRT was 954 (140 pmp). The median ages of existing and new patients receiving RRT were 55 and 56 years, respectively. There was a trend towards an increasing number of elderly dialysis patients. Diabetes was the third major cause of renal failure among existing RRT patients and the most common cause of renal failure in new cases. The rate of serologic positivity for hepatitis B infection in RRT patients was 9.68%, while that for hepatitis C infection was 3.28%. In Hong Kong, most patients were put on PD when RRT was required. Of all patients on dialysis, 83% were on PD, of whom 94.8% were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Most CAPD patients were on disconnect systems. HD was used in 17.5% of all patients on dialysis. Of the 2,269 patients with functioning kidney transplants, 836 (36.8%) were transplanted in Hong Kong. Of these, 495 (59.2%) had undergone cadaveric kidney transplantation. Of all patients receiving RRT, 30% were receiving erythropoietin. For the year ending 31 March 2004, the annual crude mortality rate for all RRT was 10% (15.3% for PD, 13% for HD, and 1.9% for transplantation). The major causes of death were infection, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular accident. The 1- and 5-year survival rates for patients with kidney transplantation performed in Hong Kong between 1 April 1997 and 31 March 2003 were 98.6% and 96.5%, respectively, for living related kidney transplants, and 96.1% and 91.2%, respectively, for cadaveric kidney transplants. The 1- and 5- year graft survival rates were 91.1% and 86.1% (death censored) and 90.5% and 85.6% (death not censored) for living related kidney transplants, and 89% and 83% (death censored) and 86% and 79% (death not censored) for cadaveric kidney transplants. The overall peritonitis rate for all chronic PD systems for the year ending 31 March 2004 was one episode per 27.7 months.

Comparative long-term effectiveness and safety of primary bariatric surgeries in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults: a protocol for systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.

INTRODUCTION Bariatric surgeries are effective in treating obesity related comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus. More robust evidence is needed to facilitate choice of procedure. In this systemic review, we aim to investigate the comparative long-term effectiveness in inducing remission of type 2 diabetes, halting diabetic complications, reducing mortality and the safety of conventional and emerging bariatric surgeries. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Databases including Cochrane Central Register, EMBASE, MEDLINE and clinical trial registries will be searched for randomised controlled trials with at least 3 years of follow-up, including direct and/or indirect evidence regarding primary bariatric surgeries in overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, from inception of each database to 2019, with no language or publication type limits imposed. Dual selection of studies, data extraction and risk of bias assessments will be performed. Primary outcomes include full diabetes remission, composite outcome of full or partial diabetes remission and adverse event profiles. Secondary outcomes include anthropometric measurements, cardiovascular risk factor burden, medication burden, diabetic complications and all-cause mortality. Given sufficient homogeneity, network meta-analyses will be performed in a random-effects model based on the Bayesian framework, while assessing for consistency between direct and indirect estimates. Heterogeneities of studies will be explored through meta-regression analysis, and robustness of findings will be checked by sensitivity analysis, and an alternative method under a frequentist framework. All statistical analysis and graphical presentations will be conducted by R software V.3.3.3 (The R Project for Statistical Computing). The overall quality of the evidence will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria for each outcome. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval is not required as individual patient data will not be included. This review will be subject for publication in a peer reviewed journal. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER CRD42018110775.

Expressions of multiple inflammation markers in the patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and their clinical values/ 中华检验医学杂志

Objective@#To explore the Expressions of multiple inflammation markers in the patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) and their clinical values, and to provide theoretical basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment.@*Methods@#A total of 164 patients, diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People&apos;s Hospital from January to February 2020, were selected as the research group and divided into three groups (ordinary, severe, and critically severe pneumonia) according to the disease severity. Meandwhile 66 non-infected patients during the same period were selected as negative control group. The expressions of WBC, LYM, CRP, SAA, and PCT were retrospective studied and compared between groups. The diagnostic values of WBC, CRP, SAA and the combination of these three markers in all patients with COVID-19 and in different severity groups were analyzed by ROC curve.@*Results@#Compared with control group (WBC count :8.13(6.51,9.42)×109/L, LYM count:2.00(1.28,2.43)×109/L), WBC count [4.94(4.05, 6.67) ×109/L] and LYM count [1.33(0.94, 1.96) ×109/L] of COVID-19 patients were significantly reduced (Z=-7.435, P&lt;0.01; Z=-4.906, P&lt;0.01) . Compared with the control group [CRP: 1.36 (0.57~5.67) mg/ml; SAA:[4.98 (4.80~15.75) mg/mL], CRP [7.93 (2.45~23.98) mg/ml] and SAA [34.13 (4.83~198.40) mg/ml] were increased in research group (Z=-5.72, P&lt;0.01; Z=-4.166, P&lt;0.01) . PCT in the control group and the research group were 0.100 0(0.030 6~0.100 0)ng/ml and 0.044 5(0.031 6~0.077 0)ng/ml, respectively. There was no statistical difference between two groups (Z=-1.451, P=0.147) . The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of WBC, CRP and SAA in patients with COVID-19 were 0.814, 0.742, 0.673, respectively (P&lt;0.01), while the AUC of the combination of three indexes for COVID-19 diagnosis was 0.882, with 83.33%(55/66) specificity and 84.76% (139/164) sensitivity, P&lt;0.01.The AUCs of WBC, CRP, and SAA for predicting severe and critically severe COVID-19 were 0.799, 0.779, and 0.886 , respectively (P&lt;0.01), and the AUC of the combination of three indexes for the diagnosis of severe and critically severe COVID-19 was 0.924, with 78.67% (118/150) specificity and 14/14 sensitivity (P&lt;0.01).@*Conclusion@#Combining detection of WBC, CRP and SAA can improve the specificity and sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnosis, with a high diagnostic value for severe and critically severe COVID-19.

The impact of a three-phase video-assisted debriefing on nursing students' debriefing experiences, perceived stress and facilitators' practices: A mixed methods study

BACKGROUND: As an integral part of simulation, debriefing helps learners to construct knowledge through reflecting, internalizing, and relating. Video-assisted debriefing (VAD) adds audio-visual captures and reviews to support traditional verbal debriefing (VD), but evidence evaluating its educational effects has been mixed, with limited attention focusing on its structure development. AIMS: This study aimed to 1) investigate the effects of a three-phase VAD in enhancing nursing students' debriefing experiences and perceived stress compared to VD and 2) to explore its impact on facilitators' debriefing practices. METHODS: A mixed-methods design was adopted. The quantitative phase involved a prospective controlled trial on 145 nursing students from a university in Singapore who were randomized into the intervention cluster (n = 72) and the control cluster (n = 73). The debriefing experience scale (DES), the stress visual analogue scale (Stress VAS), and the debriefing assessment for simulation in healthcare (DASH© student version) were used as outcome measures. For the qualitative component, a purposive sample of eight facilitators evaluated their own debriefing practices using the DASH© instructor version and each completed an open-ended question survey. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Students from the intervention cluster significantly improved their debriefing experiences (p = 0.01), experienced comparable stress, and had better impressions of VAD facilitators' practices (p < 0.001) compared to those in the control cluster. Repeated VAD significantly reduced students' stress (p < 0.001). Students viewed the VAD facilitators as more effective than the VD facilitators. Three categories were derived from the qualitative comments: the act of debriefing, the crux of VAD, and debriefing for success. CONCLUSION: The three-phase VAD significantly improved nursing students' debriefing experiences without adding extra stress. It also helped to improve facilitators' practices. Future research will benefit from exploring how experts facilitate the three-phase VAD "on the ground" and its effect on learning transfer and cost-effectiveness.

Assessment of Restored Kidney Transplantation Including the Use of Wider Criteria for Accepting Renal Donors After Cancer Excision.

The transplantation of kidneys after cancer excision (restored kidney transplantation, RKT) warrants further evaluation as a source of kidneys for transplantation. We determined whether larger cancers can be safely transplanted, the risks of adverse events from RKT, and whether RKT confers a survival advantage for patients waiting for transplantation. Methods In a retrospective cohort study, 23 dialysis patients awaiting transplant underwent RKT at John Hunter Hospital, Australia between 2008 and 2015. Patients were >60 years old and accepted onto the National Organ Matching Service. This RKT Group was divided into donor renal cancers ≤30 mm and >30-≤50 mm. Adverse event profiles for RKT recipients were compared with 22 standard live donor recipients using logistic regression analyses. Recipient and transplant survivals for RKT were compared with 2050 controls from Australian New Zealand Dialysis Transplant Registry using Cox regression models. To increase statistical power for survival analyses, data from 25 RKT recipients from Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane were added, thus creating 48 RKT recipients. Results There were no significant differences in mortality, transplant failure nor AEs between the 2 cancer Groups. RKT increased the risks of Adverse event profiles (odds ratio: 6.48 [2.92-15.44]; P < 0.001). RKT reduced mortality risk by 30% (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.70 [0.36-1.07]; P = 0.299) compared with those continuing on the transplant list who may or may not be transplanted. RKT significantly reduced mortality risk for those remaining on dialysis (HR: 2.86 [1.43-5.72]; P = 0.003). Transplant survival for RKT was reduced compared with control deceased donor (HR: 0.42 [0.21-0.83]; P = 0.013) and live donor transplants (HR: 0.33 [0.02-0.86]; P =0.023). Conclusions The use of larger carefully selected cancer-resected kidneys for transplantation appears safe and effective. RKT confers a possible survival advantage compared with waiting for transplantation, an increased survival compared with those remaining on dialysis but reduced transplant survival.

Modeling the worldwide spread of pandemic influenza: baseline case and containment interventions.

BACKGROUND The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus, which is now widespread in Southeast Asia and which diffused recently in some areas of the Balkans region and Western Europe, has raised a public alert toward the potential occurrence of a new severe influenza pandemic. Here we study the worldwide spread of a pandemic and its possible containment at a global level taking into account all available information on air travel. METHODS AND FINDINGS We studied a metapopulation stochastic epidemic model on a global scale that considers airline travel flow data among urban areas. We provided a temporal and spatial evolution of the pandemic with a sensitivity analysis of different levels of infectiousness of the virus and initial outbreak conditions (both geographical and seasonal). For each spreading scenario we provided the timeline and the geographical impact of the pandemic in 3,100 urban areas, located in 220 different countries. We compared the baseline cases with different containment strategies, including travel restrictions and the therapeutic use of antiviral (AV) drugs. We investigated the effect of the use of AV drugs in the event that therapeutic protocols can be carried out with maximal coverage for the populations in all countries. In view of the wide diversity of AV stockpiles in different regions of the world, we also studied scenarios in which only a limited number of countries are prepared (i.e., have considerable AV supplies). In particular, we compared different plans in which, on the one hand, only prepared and wealthy countries benefit from large AV resources, with, on the other hand, cooperative containment scenarios in which countries with large AV stockpiles make a small portion of their supplies available worldwide. CONCLUSIONS We show that the inclusion of air transportation is crucial in the assessment of the occurrence probability of global outbreaks. The large-scale therapeutic usage of AV drugs in all hit countries would be able to mitigate a pandemic effect with a reproductive rate as high as 1.9 during the first year; with AV supply use sufficient to treat approximately 2% to 6% of the population, in conjunction with efficient case detection and timely drug distribution. For highly contagious viruses (i.e., a reproductive rate as high as 2.3), even the unrealistic use of supplies corresponding to the treatment of approximately 20% of the population leaves 30%-50% of the population infected. In the case of limited AV supplies and pandemics with a reproductive rate as high as 1.9, we demonstrate that the more cooperative the strategy, the more effective are the containment results in all regions of the world, including those countries that made part of their resources available for global use.

Options in topical therapies in the management of patients with acute pain.

The traditional cornerstones of analgesic therapy for patients with acute pain have been oral therapies; however, all oral agents exhibit a variety of potentially dose-limiting or intolerable adverse effects in patients. Elderly patients and those with concomitant conditions already being managed with multiple systemic drugs may be particularly susceptible to systemic toxicities with oral analgesic therapies. Topical agents offer an alternative to oral modalities and can effectively treat patients with acute pain while offering lower systemic absorption and conferring little risk of systemic toxicity. The objective of this article is to review the therapeutic usefulness of available topical therapies in their most thoroughly investigated applications, the treatment of patients with acute musculoskeletal and herpetic pain. For example, although heating pads/wraps and cold packs are widely used to alleviate pain associated with sprains, strains, and contusions, evidence of the effectiveness of these methods is lacking. However, there are sufficient data supporting the use of various topical formulations of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for these indications (ketoprofen gel or patch, ibuprofen gel or cream, and diclofenac gel or patch), and demonstrating markedly less patient risk of systemic toxicity than is associated with oral NSAID therapy. A ketoprofen patch was shown to be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with tendinopathies. In the treatment of acute neck or low back pain, cold and heat therapies have demonstrated limited effectiveness for patients, and the efficacy of topical NSAIDs has not been established. Use of topical NSAID therapy has been useful in reducing acute-phase herpes zoster pain, and the lidocaine 5% patch has been shown to reduce acute herpetic pain intensity once lesions have healed (the patch cannot be applied to open skin lesions). Topical analgesics represent an alternative treatment modality for patients experiencing acute pain who cannot or choose not to take oral therapies.

Acromegaly and pregnancy: a retrospective multicenter study of 59 pregnancies in 46 women.

CONTEXT Few data are available on pregnancy outcomes in women with acromegaly. STUDY DESIGN This was a retrospective multicenter study. PATIENTS The study included 46 women with GH-secreting pituitary microadenomas (n = 7) or macroadenomas (n = 39). Their mean age was 31.7 yr (±4.5 yr). Incomplete transsphenoidal surgical resection (n = 39) and pituitary radiation (n = 14) had been performed, respectively, 2.9 ± 2.6 and 7.3 ± 4.2 yr before pregnancy. The patients were receiving dopamine agonists (n = 25) and/or somatostatin analogs (n = 14), and GH/IGF-I hypersecretion was controlled and uncontrolled in, respectively, 23 and 34 cases. Five pregnancies followed the fertility treatment. RESULTS Fifty-nine pregnancies resulted in 64 healthy babies. Gestational diabetes and gravid hypertension occurred in four (6.8%) and eight (13.6%) pregnancies, respectively, and both were more frequent when GH/IGF-I hypersecretion was not controlled before pregnancy. Visual field defects were diagnosed during pregnancy in four women, three of whom were diagnosed with acromegaly during the pregnancy. Seven women had isolated headache. Magnetic resonance imaging performed 3.9 ± 0.3 months after delivery showed that the size of the adenoma had increased in three cases, decreased in two cases, and remained stable in 22 cases. Seventeen women breast-fed with no complications. Four women gave birth to a small-for-gestational-age infant; all had received somatostatin analogs, alone or in combination with dopamine agonists, during pregnancy. The mean IGF-I level fell significantly during the first trimester in 12 cases (before conception 588 ± 207 ng/ml, first trimester 319 ± 126 ng/ml, P = 0.002), whereas the GH concentration did not change significantly. CONCLUSION The following conclusions were reached: 1) pregnancy in women with active or uncontrolled acromegaly may be associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes and gravid hypertension; 2) pregnancy is occasionally associated with symptomatic enlargement of GH-secreting pituitary macroadenomas; 3) changes in serum GH and IGF-I concentrations are variable during pregnancy, indicating that routine monitoring is not mandatory if the pregnancy is uneventful; and 4) GH-suppressive treatment can be safely withdrawn after conception in most acromegalic women.

Effects of remote ischemic preconditioning in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery (Remote IMPACT): a randomized controlled trial.

BACKGROUND Remote ischemic preconditioning is a simple therapy that may reduce cardiac and kidney injury. We undertook a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of this therapy on markers of heart and kidney injury after cardiac surgery. METHODS Patients at high risk of death within 30 days after cardiac surgery were randomly assigned to undergo remote ischemic preconditioning or a sham procedure after induction of anesthesia. The preconditioning therapy was three 5-minute cycles of thigh ischemia, with 5 minutes of reperfusion between cycles. The sham procedure was identical except that ischemia was not induced. The primary outcome was peak creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) within 24 hours after surgery (expressed as multiples of the upper limit of normal, with log transformation). The secondary outcome was change in creatinine level within 4 days after surgery (expressed as log-transformed micromoles per litre). Patient-important outcomes were assessed up to 6 months after randomization. RESULTS We randomly assigned 128 patients to remote ischemic preconditioning and 130 to the sham therapy. There were no significant differences in postoperative CK-MB (absolute mean difference 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.07 to 0.36) or creatinine (absolute mean difference 0.06, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.23). Other outcomes did not differ significantly for remote ischemic preconditioning relative to the sham therapy: for myocardial infarction, relative risk (RR) 1.35 (95% CI 0.85 to 2.17); for acute kidney injury, RR 1.10 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.78); for stroke, RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.34 to 3.07); and for death, RR 1.47 (95% CI 0.65 to 3.31). INTERPRETATION Remote ischemic precnditioning did not reduce myocardial or kidney injury during cardiac surgery. This type of therapy is unlikely to substantially improve patient-important outcomes in cardiac surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov, no. NCT01071265.

Declining Public Health Protections within Autocratic Regimes: Impact on Global Public Health Security, Infectious Disease Outbreaks, Epidemics, and Pandemics

Public health emergencies of international concern, in the form of infectious disease outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics, represent an increasing risk to the world's population. Management requires coordinated responses, across many disciplines and nations, and the capacity to muster proper national and global public health education, infrastructure, and prevention measures. Unfortunately, increasing numbers of nations are ruled by autocratic regimes which have characteristically failed to adopt investments in public health infrastructure, education, and prevention measures to keep pace with population growth and density. Autocratic leaders have a direct impact on health security, a direct negative impact on health, and create adverse political and economic conditions that only complicate the crisis further. This is most evident in autocratic regimes where health protections have been seriously and purposely curtailed. All autocratic regimes define public health along economic and political imperatives that are similar across borders and cultures. Autocratic regimes are seriously handicapped by sociopathic narcissistic leaders who are incapable of understanding the health consequences of infectious diseases or the impact on their population. A cross section of autocratic nations currently experiencing the impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) are reviewed to demonstrate the manner where self-serving regimes fail to manage health crises and place the rest of the world at increasing risk. It is time to re-address the pre-SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) global agendas calling for stronger strategic capacity, legal authority, support, and institutional status under World Health Organization (WHO) leadership granted by an International Health Regulations Treaty. Treaties remain the most successful means the world has in preventing, preparing for, and controlling epidemics in an increasingly globalized world."Honesty is worth a lot more than hope " The Economist, February 17, 2020.

Management and biosecurity practices on pig farms in the Western Highlands of Cameroon (Central Africa)

African swine fever (ASF), erysipelas and many other infectious and parasitic diseases have seriously compromised the future of pig industry in the Western Highlands of Cameroon. Since implementation of biosecurity measures (BM) is known to reduce the risk of disease transmission, the objective of this study was to describe the pig farming management system as well as the biosecurity practices on pig farms in the Western Highlands of Cameroon. Therefore, 97 farms were investigated using a face‐to‐face interview‐based questionnaire. Biosecurity practices were divided in three components: isolation, traffic control and sanitation. The results revealed that the majority of farms were extensive (73.22%), farrow‐to‐finish farms (59.79%) and essentially raising crossed‐bred (72.75%). The most practiced BM regarding ‘isolation’ were as follows: maintenance of the minimum distance between farms (56.06%) and dispatching of animals of same age in the same room (97.16%); for ‘traffic control’, the measures included the following: assignment of specific tools and equipment (96.86%) to a specific piggery; concerning ‘sanitation’, daily cleaning (97.06%), as well as using disinfectants (89.13%) were mostly implemented. The measures less implemented for ‘isolation’ included fencing (11.83%), compliance with the all‐in all‐out principle (10.11%), use of specific clothing (6.03%) and quarantine (7.69%); for ‘traffic control’, the less adopted measures comprised visitor hands washed before animal handling (11.65%), respect of linear flow principle (13.52%). Concerning ‘sanitation’, these measures included functional footbath (29.90%), processing of drinking water (27.84%) and cleanout (18.14%). The biosecurity level was low, intermediate and high for 73.71, 21.55 and 4.73% of farms, respectively. This low level suggests that ASF and other diseases are likely to remain endemic. The most important measures of concern and to improve are as follows: not feeding kitchen waste to pigs; keeping other livestock species away from pigs; fencing pig barn; keeping newly arrived animals in quarantine, not exchanging boars; not selling sick animals.

Infarct Topography and Detection of Atrial Fibrillation in Cryptogenic Stroke: Results from CRYSTAL AF.

BACKGROUND Insertable cardiac monitors (ICM) have been shown to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) at a higher rate than routine monitoring methods in patients with cryptogenic stroke (CS). However, it is unknown whether there are topographic patterns of brain infarction in patients with CS that are particularly associated with underlying AF. If such patterns exist, these could be used to help decide whether or not CS patients would benefit from long-term monitoring with an ICM. METHODS In this retrospective analysis, a neuro-radiologist blinded to clinical details reviewed brain images from 212 patients with CS who were enrolled in the ICM arm of the CRYptogenic STroke And underLying AF (CRYSTAL AF) trial. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to describe rates of AF detection at 12 months in patients with and without pre-specified imaging characteristics. Hazard ratios (HRs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p values were calculated using Cox regression. RESULTS We did not find any pattern of acute brain infarction that was significantly associated with AF detection after CS. However, the presence of chronic brain infarctions (15.8 vs. 7.0%, HR 2.84, 95% CI 1.13-7.15, p = 0.02) or leukoaraiosis (18.2 vs. 7.9%, HR 2.94, 95% CI 1.28-6.71, p < 0.01) was associated with AF detection. There was a borderline significant association of AF detection with the presence of chronic territorial (defined as within the territory of a first or second degree branch of the circle of Willis) infarcts (20.9 vs. 10.0%, HR 2.37, 95% CI 0.98-5.72, p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS We found no evidence for an association between brain infarction pattern and AF detection using an ICM in patients with CS, although patients with coexisting chronic, as well as acute, brain infarcts had a higher rate of AF detection. Acute brain infarction topography does not reliably predict or exclude detection of underlying AF in patients with CS and should not be used to select patients for ICM after cryptogenic stroke.

The interaction between BRAF mutation and microsatellite instability (MSI) status in determining survival outcomes after adjuvant 5FU based chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer.

PURPOSE The predictive role of biomarkers in colon cancer is still being defined. The aim of this study is to determine the interaction between BRAF mutation and microsatellite instability (MSI) status in determining survival benefit after adjuvant 5-FU based chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study including all curatively resected stage III colon cancer cases over a 33-year period. A clinicopathological database was collated (adjuvant chemotherapy, age, gender, obstruction, perforation, tumor location, grade, mucin, nodal stage, extramural vascular, and perineural invasion). BRAF (V600E) mutation testing was performed and MSI status established by immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair proteins and molecular testing for National Cancer Institute panel markers. Patients were categorized into four groups for comparison: MSS and BRAF-ve (termed " traditional"), MSI and BRAF-ve (termed " presumed Lynch"), MSI and BRAF+ve (termed " sporadic MSI"), and MSS and BRAF+ve (termed " other BRAF"). The primary endpoint was cancer specific survival. Interaction testing was conducted to determine whether there were different responses to chemotherapy between groups. RESULTS A total of 686 unselected cases met inclusion criteria and had tissue available, of which 15.7% had BRAF mutation (BRAF+ve) and 13.8% had MSI. Thirty-nine percent received chemotherapy. Overall, adjuvant chemotherapy produced a cancer specific survival benefit (HR 0.66, 95% CI, 0.49-0.88, P < 0.01). On adjusted analysis, neither BRAF nor MSI status were individually predictive of survival benefit. On adjusted analysis specifically of the chemotherapy effect in each subgroup, only patients in the presumed Lynch (HR 0.260, 95% CI, 0.09-0.80, P < 0.01) and other BRAF groups (HR 0.45, 95% CI, 0.23-0.87, P < 0.01) had a significant survival benefit from chemotherapy. On interaction testing of subgroups, adjusting for all the clinicopathological parameters, only patients in the presumed Lynch group (HR 0.277, 95% CI, 0.10-0.75, P < 0.01) gained a differentially greater benefit from chemotherapy than other groups. CONCLUSIONS In this historical cohort, MSI testing is predictive of response to adjuvant chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer, but only when results are interpreted in combination with BRAF. This supports the role of routine testing for these biomarkers.

Investigating the effect of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing on pain intensity in patients with primary dysmenorrhea: a protocol for a randomized controlled trial.

BACKGROUND Unpleasant experience with the previous menstruation can increase the sensitivity to pain which may lead to moderate to severe pain in patients with dysmenorrhea. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychological method to alleviate the distress from unpleasant memories and related events and can be used for other conditions such as anxiety, depression, and chronic pain. This protocol was designed to investigate the effect of EMDR therapy on pain intensity in patients with dysmenorrhea. METHODS/DESIGN A randomized clinical trial was designed in compliance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT). Female students who have moderate to severe primary dysmenorrhea (based on a visual analogue scale [VAS] score of at least 4 for two consecutive months) and who live in dormitories at Qazvin University of Medical Sciences in Qazvin, Iran will be invited to participate in the study. The total sample size will be 88 girls, who will be randomly assigned to intervention (N = 44) and control (N = 44) groups. EMDR therapy will be performed for the intervention group, while the control group can use sedative or other pain relife methods as their routin... There will be six treatment sessions, which will be held twice a week. The duration of each session is 30-90 min, according to the convenience of each participant. The data will be collected using the demographic characteristics questionnaire, the VAS, the Subjective Units of Anxiety or Distress Scale (SUD), and the Validity of Cognition Scale (VOC). The data on pain intensity due to primary dysmenorrhea in both groups will be collected at 1 and 2 months before the intervention (to identify eligible participants) and 1 and 2 months after the intervention (follow-ups). Data will be analyzed by using SPSS version 25 software and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures with appropriate post hoc tests. A P value of less than 0.05 will be considered significant. DISCUSSION The results are expected to provide the information on the efficacy of EMDR therapy to manage moderate to severe pain in patients with primary dysmenorrhea. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The research proposal is approved by the human ethics committee of Qazvin University of Medical Sciences (IR.QUMS.REC.1397.100). The results of this trial will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed research journal. TRIAL REGISTRATION IRCT20180823040851N1 . Registered on 6, October 2018.

Efficacy of coaxial ventilation with a novel endotracheal catheter equipped with a functional cuff: A swine model study.

BACKGROUND We have developed an endotracheal catheter with a functional cuff (ECFC) that inflates during inspiration and deflates during expiration. This catheter, together with a regular ICU ventilator, can provide coaxial ventilation. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of ventilation in adult human-sized swine using an ECFC and a regular ICU ventilator. DESIGN A prospective animal study. SETTING Experimental, Trauma Transplant Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. ANIMALS Eight adult Yorkshire swine, weighing 45 to 50 kg, were studied. INTERVENTIONS To create the ECFC, a 5 cm long latex cuff was placed over the distal side ports of either a 14 or 19-Fr gauge endotracheal catheter and a 1 cm long piece of plastic tube was inserted into the tip of the endotracheal catheter to create an internal resistance. The ECFC was placed into the trachea and the proximal end of the ECFC was connected to an ICU ventilator in pressure-control mode, with peak pressures set at either 25, 50 or 70 cmH2O. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Tidal volume was calculated using plethysmography. RESULTS During pressure control ventilation with the 14-Fr gauge ECFC at set inspiratory pressures of 25, 50 and 75 cmH2O, the tidal volumes generated were 209 ± 36, 309 ± 61 and 367 ± 85 ml, respectively, and with the 19-Fr gauge ECFC these were 277 ± 51, 442 ± 91 and 538 ± 123 ml, respectively. No complications were observed. CONCLUSION An ECFC combined with a regular pressure-controlled ICU ventilator can produce adequate tidal volumes in adult human-sized swine. Our results establish the feasibility of ventilation with this new alternative technique. The safety and advantages of such a technique remain to be determined in humans.

Pns121 Does the Choice of Independent Expert Committee Affect Icer Outcomes?

Objectives: The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) publishes reports on the clinical and economic value of drugs for US payers. Each report is subject to a public meeting by one of three independent expert committees (the California Technology Assessment Forum [CTAF], Midwest Comparative Effectiveness Public Advisory Council [CEPAC], and New England CEPAC) discusses the report and votes on the evidence presented. This research compares and contrasts outcomes by committee. Methods: All publicly available final ICER reports of pharmaceuticals (01/01/2014-12/31/2019) were screened and key data extracted. Results: 38 ICER reports of pharmaceuticals were identified (CTAF: 11; Midwest CEPAC: 12; New England CEPAC: 15), encompassing 110 drugs in 78 conditions/subgroups. Clinical ratings were provided for 277 drug comparisons (CTAF: 41; Midwest CEPAC: 46; New England CEPAC: 190). For the CTAF, Midwest CEPAC, New England CEPAC, respectively, 19 (46%), 23 (50%), and 33 (17%) drug comparisons achieved a rating of A, B, or B+; 3 (7%), 9 (20%), and 80 (42%) achieved a rating of C, C+, C-, or D; 19 (46%), 14 (30%), and 77 (41%) achieved a rating of P/I or I. Cost-utility assessments were undertaken for 117 treatment settings (CTAF: 35; Midwest CEPAC: 32; New England CEPAC: 50). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY, 11 therapies (31%) were deemed cost-effective/cost-saving by the CTAF, 9 (28%) by the Midwest CEPAC, and 21 (42%) by the New England CEPAC. Of the 51 votes for healthcare value, most drugs had a majority vote of low or intermediate value: CTAF: 9 (90%); Midwest CEPAC: 12 (86%); New England CEPAC: 22 (81%). Conclusions: There are generally few differences between ICER committee outcomes, although there are some variances, which are likely due to therapy area focus. Considering healthcare value, ICER committees are generally consistent in reporting that most drugs provide low to intermediate value.

Validation of a digital pathology system including remote review during the COVID-19 pandemic

Remote digital pathology allows healthcare systems to maintain pathology operations during public health emergencies. Existing Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments regulations require pathologists to electronically verify patient reports from a certified facility. During the 2019 pandemic of COVID-19 disease, caused by the SAR-CoV-2 virus, this requirement potentially exposes pathologists, their colleagues, and household members to the risk of becoming infected. Relaxation of government enforcement of this regulation allows pathologists to review and report pathology specimens from a remote, non-CLIA certified facility. The availability of digital pathology systems can facilitate remote microscopic diagnosis, although formal comprehensive (case-based) validation of remote digital diagnosis has not been reported. All glass slides representing routine clinical signout workload in surgical pathology subspecialties at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center were scanned on an Aperio GT450 at ×40 equivalent resolution (0.26 µm/pixel). Twelve pathologists from nine surgical pathology subspecialties remotely reviewed and reported complete pathology cases using a digital pathology system from a non-CLIA certified facility through a secure connection. Whole slide images were integrated to and launched within the laboratory information system to a custom vendor-agnostic, whole slide image viewer. Remote signouts utilized consumer-grade computers and monitors (monitor size, 13.3–42 in.; resolution, 1280 × 800–3840 × 2160 pixels) connecting to an institution clinical workstation via secure virtual private network. Pathologists subsequently reviewed all corresponding glass slides using a light microscope within the CLIA-certified department. Intraobserver concordance metrics included reporting elements of top-line diagnosis, margin status, lymphovascular and/or perineural invasion, pathology stage, and ancillary testing. The median whole slide image file size was 1.3 GB; scan time/slide averaged 90 s; and scanned tissue area averaged 612 mm(2). Signout sessions included a total of 108 cases, comprised of 254 individual parts and 1196 slides. Major diagnostic equivalency was 100% between digital and glass slide diagnoses; and overall concordance was 98.8% (251/254). This study reports validation of primary diagnostic review and reporting of complete pathology cases from a remote site during a public health emergency. Our experience shows high (100%) intraobserver digital to glass slide major diagnostic concordance when reporting from a remote site. This randomized, prospective study successfully validated remote use of a digital pathology system including operational feasibility supporting remote review and reporting of pathology specimens, and evaluation of remote access performance and usability for remote signout.

The Incidence of Respiratory Tract Infection in Adults Requiring Hospitalization for Asthma

Acute respiratory tract infections (RTI) are known to worsen asthma particularly in children. There are few studies in adults assessing the incidence of RTI in patients hospitalized with acute asthma. AIM: To document the incidence of RTI in adults hospitalized with acute asthma. METHODS: A prospective study of patients with acute asthma admitted to the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Western Hospital Footscray, over a 12-month period. A control group was studied from elective surgical inpatients. Patients were investigated with serologic tests for Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Legionella, and influenza A and R. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were cultured for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, and herpes simplex virus. If sputum was available, it was assessed with microscopy and culture. Rlood cultures were taken if patients were febrile and all patients had a chest radiograph. Control subjects completed serologic tests and NPA. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients (33 male and 46 female) and 54 control subjects (26 male and 28 female) were studied. Two patients were enrolled twice. Mean (±SD) age of patients was 35 ±15 years (range, 16 to 66 years), and mean age of control subjects was 37±15 years (range, 18 to 69 years). In the patient group, 29 (37%) had evidence of recent RTI of which 23 were viral. Five of the control subjects (9%) had evidence of recent RTI (p<0.001). Twenty-four patients were positive on serologic and/or NPA culture. Five patients had positive serologic test results and/or NPA culture to two or more agents. Two patients tested positive on sputum, radiograph, and temperature criteria. Three patients tested positive on the basis of radiographic evidence of consolidation, blood neutrophilia, and temperature. Influenza A (13) and rhinovirus (9) were the most common infectious agents. Other agents identified were RSV (one), influenza R (two), adenovirus (one), and Mycoplasma (one). Influenza and rhinovirus infections occurred predominantly in late and early winter, respectively. Summer hospitalization did not relate to RTI. CONCLUSION: Thirty-seven percent of adult patients with acute asthma admitted to the Department of Respiratory Medicine over a 12-month period had evidence of recent RTI.

Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Surveillance and Containment Measures for the First 100 Patients with COVID-19 in Singapore - January 2-February 29, 2020

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and has since spread globally, resulting in >95,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide by March 5, 2020 (1). Singapore adopted a multipronged surveillance strategy that included applying the case definition at medical consults, tracing contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, enhancing surveillance among different patient groups (all patients with pneumonia, hospitalized patients in intensive care units [ICUs] with possible infectious diseases, primary care patients with influenza-like illness, and deaths from possible infectious etiologies), and allowing clinician discretion (i.e., option to order a test based on clinical suspicion, even if the case definition was not met) to identify COVID-19 patients. Containment measures, including patient isolation and quarantine, active monitoring of contacts, border controls, and community education and precautions, were performed to minimize disease spread. As of March 5, 2020, a total of 117 COVID-19 cases had been identified in Singapore. This report analyzes the first 100 COVID-19 patients in Singapore to determine the effectiveness of the surveillance and containment measures. COVID-19 patients were classified by the primary means by which they were detected. Application of the case definition and contact tracing identified 73 patients, 16 were detected by enhanced surveillance, and 11 were identified by laboratory testing based on providers' clinical discretion. Effectiveness of these measures was assessed by calculating the 7-day moving average of the interval from symptom onset to isolation in hospital or quarantine, which indicated significant decreasing trends for both local and imported COVID-19 cases. Rapid identification and isolation of cases, quarantine of close contacts, and active monitoring of other contacts have been effective in suppressing expansion of the outbreak and have implications for other countries experiencing outbreaks.

Clinical progression of patients with COVID-19 in Shanghai, China

Summary Background Studies on the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have generally been limited to the description of the epidemiology and initial clinical characteristics. We investigated the temporal progression in patients with COVID-19. Methods In this retrospective, single-center study, we included confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020 in Shanghai. Final date of follow-up was February 25, 2020. Results Of the 249 patients enrolled, the median age was 51 years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male. The duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2–7) days in symptomatic patients. Fever was occurred in 235(94.3%) patients. A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been discharged after 16(12–20) days hospitalization. The estimated median duration of fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs]: 8–11 days) after onset of symptoms. Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P <0.0001). Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms. 154(94.5%) of these patients showed radiological improvement on day 14. The median duration to negative reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days (95 CIs: 10–12 days). Viral clearance was more likely to be delayed in patients in ICU than those not in ICU (P <0.0001). In multivariate logistical analysis, age (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.06) and CD4 T cell count (OR = 0.55 per 100 cells/ul increase) were independently associated with ICU admission. Conclusions The majority of COVID-19 cases are mild. The clinical progression pattern suggests that early control of viral replication and application of host-directed therapy in later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of CVOID-19.

Impact of the COVID-19 virus outbreak on movement and play behaviours of Canadian children and youth: a national survey

BACKGROUND: Healthy childhood development is fostered through sufficient physical activity (PA; including time outdoors), limiting sedentary behaviours (SB), and adequate sleep; collectively known as movement behaviours. Though the COVID-19 virus outbreak has changed the daily lives of children and youth, it is unknown to what extent related restrictions may compromise the ability to play and meet movement behaviour recommendations. This secondary data analysis examined the immediate impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on movement and play behaviours in children and youth. METHODS: A national sample of Canadian parents (n = 1472) of children (5–11 years) or youth (12–17 years) (54% girls) completed an online survey that assessed immediate changes in child movement and play behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak. Behaviours included PA and play, SB, and sleep. Family demographics and parental factors that may influence movement behaviours were assessed. Correlations between behaviours and demographic and parental factors were determined. For open-ended questions, word frequency distributions were reported. RESULTS: Only 4.8% (2.8% girls, 6.5% boys) of children and 0.6% (0.8% girls, 0.5% boys) of youth were meeting combined movement behaviour guidelines during COVID-19 restrictions. Children and youth had lower PA levels, less outside time, higher SB (including leisure screen time), and more sleep during the outbreak. Parental encouragement and support, parental engagement in PA, and family dog ownership were positively associated with healthy movement behaviours. Although families spent less time in PA and more time in SB, several parents reported adopting new hobbies or accessing new resources. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of immediate collateral consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak, demonstrating an adverse impact on the movement and play behaviours of Canadian children and youth. These findings can guide efforts to preserve and promote child health during the COVID-19 outbreak and crisis recovery period, and to inform strategies to mitigate potential harm during future pandemics.

Crystal structure of the Marburg virus GP2 core domain in its postfusion conformation.

Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) are members of the family Filoviridae ("filoviruses") and cause severe hemorrhagic fever with human case fatality rates of up to 90%. Filovirus infection requires fusion of the host cell and virus membranes, a process that is mediated by the envelope glycoprotein (GP). GP contains two subunits, the surface subunit (GP1), which is responsible for cell attachment, and the transmembrane subunit (GP2), which catalyzes membrane fusion. The GP2 ectodomain contains two heptad repeat regions, N-terminal and C-terminal (NHR and CHR, respectively), that adopt a six-helix bundle during the fusion process. The refolding of this six-helix bundle provides the thermodynamic driving force to overcome barriers associated with membrane fusion. Here we report the crystal structure of the MARV GP2 core domain in its postfusion (six-helix bundle) conformation at 1.9 Å resolution. The MARV GP2 core domain backbone conformation is virtually identical to that of EBOV GP2 (reported previously), and consists of a central NHR core trimeric coiled coil packed against peripheral CHR α-helices and an intervening loop and helix-turn-helix segments. We previously reported that the stability of the MARV GP2 postfusion structure is highly pH-dependent, with increasing stability at lower pH [Harrison, J. S., Koellhoffer, J. K., Chandran, K., and Lai, J. R. (2012) Biochemistry51, 2515-2525]. We hypothesized that this pH-dependent stability provides a mechanism for conformational control such that the postfusion six-helix bundle is promoted in the environments of appropriately mature endosomes. In this report, a structural rationale for this pH-dependent stability is described and involves a high-density array of core and surface acidic side chains at the midsection of the structure, termed the "anion stripe". In addition, many surface-exposed salt bridges likely contribute to the stabilization of the postfusion structure at low pH. These results provide structural insights into the mechanism of MARV GP2-mediated membrane fusion.

Safety, Dosimetry, and Tumor Detection Ability of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105: First-in-Human Study of a Novel Radioligand for uPAR PET Imaging.

The overexpression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptors (uPARs) represents an established biomarker for aggressiveness in most common malignant diseases, including breast cancer (BC), prostate cancer (PC), and urinary bladder cancer (UBC), and is therefore an important target for new cancer therapeutic and diagnostic strategies. In this study, uPAR PET imaging using a 68Ga-labeled version of the uPAR-targeting peptide (AE105) was investigated in a group of patients with BC, PC, and UBC. The aim of this first-in-human, phase I clinical trial was to investigate the safety and biodistribution in normal tissues and uptake in tumor lesions. Methods: Ten patients (6 PC, 2 BC, and 2 UBC) received a single intravenous dose of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 (154 ± 59 MBq; range, 48-208 MBq). The biodistribution and radiation dosimetry were assessed by serial whole-body PET/CT scans (10 min, 1 h, and 2 h after injection). Safety assessment included measurements of vital signs with regular intervals during the imaging sessions and laboratory blood screening tests performed before and after injection. In a subgroup of patients, the in vivo stability of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 was determined in collected blood and urine. PET images were visually analyzed for visible tumor uptake of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105, and SUVs were obtained from tumor lesions by manually drawing volumes of interest in the malignant tissue. Results: No adverse events or clinically detectable pharmacologic effects were found. The radioligand exhibited good in vivo stability and fast clearance from tissue compartments primarily by renal excretion. The effective dose was 0.015 mSv/MBq, leading to a radiation burden of 3 mSv when the clinical target dose of 200 MBq was used. In addition, radioligand accumulation was seen in primary tumor lesions as well as in metastases. Conclusion: This first-in-human, phase I clinical trial demonstrates the safe use and clinical potential of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 as a new radioligand for uPAR PET imaging in cancer patients.

Impact of mobile health applications on self-management in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: protocol of a systematic review.

INTRODUCTION The emergence of mobile health (mHealth) solutions, particularly mHealth applications (apps), has shown promise in self-management of chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). While majority of the previous systematic reviews have focused on the effectiveness of mHealth apps in improving treatment outcomes in patients with T2DM, there is a need to also understand how mHealth apps influence self-management of T2DM. This is crucial to ensure improvement in the design and use of mHealth apps for T2DM. This protocol describes how a systematic review will be conducted to determine in which way(s) mHealth apps might impact on self-management of T2DM. METHODS The following electronic databases will be searched from inception to April 2019: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, PsycINFO, CINAHL, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, Health Management Information Consortium database, Google Scholar and ClinicalTrials.gov. The Cochrane risk of bias tool will be used to assess methodological quality. The primary outcome measures to be assessed will be 'change in blood glucose'. The secondary outcomes measures will be 'changes in cardiovascular risk markers' (including blood pressure, body mass index and blood lipids), and self-management practices. Others will include: health-related quality of life, economic data, social support, harms (eg, death or complications leading to hospital admissions or emergency unit attendances), death from any cause, anxiety or depression and adverse events (eg, hypoglycaemic episodes). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This study will not involve the collection of primary data and will not require ethical approval. The review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and a one-page summary of the findings will be shared with relevant organisations. Presentation of findings will be made at appropriate conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER CRD42017071106.

[Clinical analysis of 31 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in children from six provinces (autonomous region) of northern China]

Objective: To analyze the epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, treatment and the short-term prognosis of 31 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in children from six provinces (autonomous region) in northern China. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the epidemiological history, clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory examinations, chest imaging, treatment and the short-term prognosis of 31 cases of 2019-nCoV was conducted. The patients were diagnosed between January 25th, 2020 and February 21st, 2020 in 21 hospitals in 17 cities of six provinces (autonomous region) of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Hebei, Henan and Shandong. Results: The age of the 31 children with 2019-nCoV infection was 7 years and 1 month (6 months-17 years). Nine cases (29%) were imported cases. Other 21 cases (68%) had contact with confirmed infected adults. One case (3%) had contact with asymptomatic returnees from Wuhan. Among the 31 children, 28 patients (90%) were family cluster cases. The clinical types were asymptomatic type in 4 cases (13%), mild type in 13 cases (42%), and common type in 14 cases (45%). No severe or critical type existed. The most common symptom was fever (n=20, 65%), including 1 case of high fever, 9 cases of moderate fever, 10 cases of low fever. Fever lasted from 1 day to 9 days. The fever of fifteen cases lasted for &#8804;3 d, while in other 5 cases lasted >3 d. Other symptoms included cough (n=14, 45%), fatigue (n=3, 10%) and diarrhea (n=3, 10%). Pharyngalgia, runny nose, dizziness, headache and vomiting were rare. In the early stage, the total leukocytes count in peripheral blood decreased in 2 cases (6%), the lymphocytes count decreased in 2 cases (6%), and the platelet count increased in 2 cases (6%).Elevation of C-reactive protein (10%, 3/30), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (19%, 4/21), procalcitonin (4%,1/28), liver enzyme (22%, 6/27) and muscle enzyme (15%, 4/27) occurred in different proportions. Renal function and blood glucose were normal. There were abnormal chest CT changes in 14 cases, including 9 cases with patchy ground glass opacities and nodules, mostly located in the lower lobe of both lungs near the pleural area. After receiving supportive treatment, the viral nucleic acid turned negative in 25 cases within 7-23 days. Among them, 24 children (77%) recovered and were discharged from hospital. No death occurred. Conclusions: In this case series, 2019-nCoV infection in children from six provinces (autonomous region) in northern China are mainly caused by close family contact. Clinical types are asymptomatic, mild and common types. Clinical manifestations and laboratory examination results are nonspecific. Close contact history of epidemiology, nucleic acid detection and chest imaging are important bases for diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection. After general treatment, the short-term prognosis is good.

Potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling study

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has the potential to cause substantial disruptions to health services, due to cases overburdening the health system or response measures limiting usual programmatic activities. We aimed to quantify the extent to which disruptions to services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in low-income and middle-income countries with high burdens of these diseases could lead to additional loss of life over the next 5 years. METHODS: Assuming a basic reproduction number of 3·0, we constructed four scenarios for possible responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: no action, mitigation for 6 months, suppression for 2 months, or suppression for 1 year. We used established transmission models of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria to estimate the additional impact on health that could be caused in selected settings, either due to COVID-19 interventions limiting activities, or due to the high demand on the health system due to the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: In high-burden settings, deaths due to HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria over 5 years could increase by up to 10%, 20%, and 36%, respectively, compared with if there was no COVID-19 pandemic. The greatest impact on HIV was estimated to be from interruption to antiretroviral therapy, which could occur during a period of high health system demand. For tuberculosis, the greatest impact would be from reductions in timely diagnosis and treatment of new cases, which could result from any prolonged period of COVID-19 suppression interventions. The greatest impact on malaria burden could be as a result of interruption of planned net campaigns. These disruptions could lead to a loss of life-years over 5 years that is of the same order of magnitude as the direct impact from COVID-19 in places with a high burden of malaria and large HIV and tuberculosis epidemics. INTERPRETATION: Maintaining the most critical prevention activities and health-care services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria could substantially reduce the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Retrospective use of next-generation sequencing reveals the presence of Enteroviruses in acute influenza-like illness respiratory samples collected in South/South-East Asia during 2010–2013

Abstract Background Emerging and re-emerging respiratory pathogens represent an increasing threat to public health. Etiological determination during outbreaks generally relies on clinical information, occasionally accompanied by traditional laboratory molecular or serological testing. Often, this limited testing leads to inconclusive findings. The Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS) collected 12,865 nasopharyngeal specimens from acute influenza-like illness (ILI) patients in five countries in South/South East Asia during 2010–2013. Three hundred and twenty-four samples which were found to be negative for influenza virus after screening with real-time RT-PCR and cell-based culture techniques demonstrated the potential for viral infection with evident cytopathic effect (CPE) in several cell lines. Objective To assess whether whole genome next-generation sequencing (WG-NGS) together with conventional molecular assays can be used to reveal the etiology of influenza negative, but CPE positive specimens. Study design The supernatant of these CPE positive cell cultures were grouped in 32 pools containing 2–26 supernatants per pool. Three WG-NGS runs were performed on these supernatant pools. Sequence reads were used to identify positive pools containing viral pathogens. Individual samples in the positive pools were confirmed by qRT-PCR, RT-PCR, PCR and Sanger sequencing from the CPE culture and original clinical specimens. Results WG-NGS was an effective way to expand pathogen identification in surveillance studies. This enabled the identification of a viral agent in 71.3% (231/324) of unidentified surveillance samples, including common respiratory pathogens (100/324; 30.9%): enterovirus (16/100; 16.0%), coxsackievirus (31/100; 31.0%), echovirus (22/100; 22.0%), human rhinovirus (3/100; 3%), enterovirus genus (2/100; 2.0%), influenza A (9/100; 9.0%), influenza B, (5/100; 5.0%), human parainfluenza (4/100; 4.0%), human adenovirus (3/100; 3.0%), human coronavirus (1/100; 1.0%), human metapneumovirus (2/100; 2.0%), and mumps virus (2/100; 2.0%), in addition to the non-respiratory pathogen herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (172/324; 53.1%) and HSV-1 co-infection with respiratory viruses (41/324; 12.7%).

Identification of a Contiguous 6-Residue Determinant in the MHV Receptor That Controls the Level of Virion Binding to Cells

Abstract Murine carcinoembryonic antigens serve as receptors for the binding and entry of the enveloped coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) into cells. Numerous receptor isoforms are now known, and each has extensive differences in its amino terminal immunoglobulin-like domain (NTD) to which MHV binds via its protruding spike proteins. Some of these receptor alterations may affect the ability to bind viral spikes. To identify individual residues controlling virus binding differences, we have used plasmid and vaccinia virus vectors to express two forms of MHV receptor differing only in their NTD. The two receptors, designated biliary glycoproteins (Bgp) 1aand 1b NTD, varied by 29 residues in the 107 amino acid NTD. When expressed from cDNAs in receptor-negative HeLa cells, these two Bgp molecules were displayed on cell surfaces to equivalent levels, as both were equally modified by a membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent. Infectious center assays revealed that the 1aisoform was 10 to 100 times more effective than 1b NTDin its ability to confer sensitivity to MHV (strain A59) infection. Bgp1awas also more effective than Bgp1b NTDin comparative virus adsorption assays, binding 6 times more MHV (strain A59) and 2.5 times more MHV (strain JHMX). Bgp1awas similarly more effective in promoting the capacity of viral spikes to mediate intercellular membrane fusion as judged by quantitation of syncytia following cocultivation of spike and receptor-bearing cells. To identify residues influencing these differences, we inserted varying numbers of 1bresidues into the Bgp1abackground via restriction fragment exchange and site-directed mutagenesis. Analysis of the resulting chimeric receptors showed that residues 38 to 43 of the NTD were key determinants of the binding and fusion differences between the two receptors. These residues map to an exposed loop (C-C′ loop) in a structural model of the closely related human carcinoembryonic antigen.

Abstract Background The first case of COVID-19 detected in Mexico was on the 27th of February 2020. On the 30th of April, 64 days after this first diagnosis, the number of patients had increased exponentially, reaching 19,224 confirmed cases and 1859 (9.67%) deaths. In response to this global outbreak, we summarise the current state of our understanding regarding COVID-19 in Mexico. Methods. We obtained the data from the official website of the Ministry of Health in Mexico. The study period was between the 27th of February and the 30th of April 2020. The cases were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and we analysed epidemiological, demographic and clinical data. Results. In Mexico, most cases of COVID-19 were located in Mexico City. The mean age of the patients was 46 years. Of the 12,656 confirmed cases, most infected individuals were between the ages of 30 and 59 years (65.85%), and there was a higher incidence rate in men (58.18%) than in women (41.82%). The patients who died had one or more comorbidities, mainly hypertension (45.53%), diabetes (39.39%) and obesity (30.4%). In the first 64 days of the epidemic, China had reported 80,304 cases with a mortality rate of 3.66%. Conclusions. Our results indicate an early transmission of COVID-19 in Mexico. The descriptive epidemiology shows similarities between the cases of COVID-19 in Mexico and those in China. In the same period of the epidemic curve, we observed a reduction in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Mexico and a higher mortality rate compared with that of China.

Effects of total fat intake on bodyweight in children.

BACKGROUND As part of efforts to prevent childhood overweight and obesity, we need to understand the relationship between total fat intake and body fatness in generally healthy children. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects and associations of total fat intake on measures of weight and body fatness in children and young people not aiming to lose weight. SEARCH METHODS For this update we revised the previous search strategy and ran it over all years in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), MEDLINE (PubMed), and Embase (Ovid) (current to 23 May 2017). No language and publication status limits were applied. We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing and unpublished studies (5 June 2017). SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children aged 24 months to 18 years, with or without risk factors for cardiovascular disease, randomised to a lower fat (30% or less of total energy (TE)) versus usual or moderate-fat diet (greater than 30%TE), without the intention to reduce weight, and assessed a measure of weight or body fatness after at least six months. We included prospective cohort studies if they related baseline total fat intake to weight or body fatness at least 12 months later. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We extracted data on participants, interventions or exposures, controls and outcomes, and trial or cohort quality characteristics, as well as data on potential effect modifiers, and assessed risk of bias for all included studies. We extracted body weight and blood lipid levels outcomes at six months, six to 12 months, one to two years, two to five years and more than five years for RCTs; and for cohort studies, at baseline to one year, one to two years, two to five years, five to 10 years and more than 10 years. We planned to perform random-effects meta-analyses with relevant subgrouping, and sensitivity and funnel plot analyses where data allowed. MAIN RESULTS We included 24 studies comprising three parallel-group RCTs (n = 1054 randomised) and 21 prospective analytical cohort studies (about 25,059 children completed). Twenty-three studies were conducted in high-income countries. No meta-analyses were possible, since only one RCT reported the same outcome at each time point range for all outcomes, and cohort studies were too heterogeneous to combine.Effects of dietary counselling to reduce total fat intake from RCTsTwo studies recruited children aged between 4 and 11 years and a third recruited children aged 12 to 13 years. Interventions were combinations of individual and group counselling, and education sessions in clinics, schools and homes, delivered by dieticians, nutritionists, behaviourists or trained, supervised teachers. Concerns about imprecision and poor reporting limited our confidence in our findings. In addition, the inclusion of hypercholesteraemic children in two trials raised concerns about applicability.One study of dietary counselling to lower total fat intake found that the intervention may make little or no difference to weight compared with usual diet at 12 months (mean difference (MD) -0.50 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.78 to 0.78; n = 620; low-quality evidence) and at three years (MD -0.60 kg, 95% CI -2.39 to 1.19; n = 612; low-quality evidence). Education delivered as a classroom curriculum probably decreased BMI in children at 17 months (MD -1.5 kg/m2, 95% CI -2.45 to -0.55; 1 RCT; n = 191; moderate-quality evidence). The effects were smaller at longer term follow-up (five years: MD 0 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.63; n = 541; seven years; MD -0.10 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.55; n = 576; low-quality evidence).Dietary counselling probably slightly reduced total cholesterol at 12 months compared to controls (MD -0.15 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.24 to -0.06; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence), but may make little or no difference over longer time periods. Dietary counselling probably slightly decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol at 12 months (MD -0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.04; 1 RCT; n = 618, moderate-quality evidence) and at five years (MD -0.09, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.01; 1 RCT; n = 623; moderate-quality evidence), compared to controls. Dietary counselling probably made little or no difference to HDL-C at 12 months (MD -0.03 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.02; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence), and at five years (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.04; 1 RCT; n = 522; moderate-quality evidence). Likewise, counselling probably made little or no difference to triglycerides in children at 12 months (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.06; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence). Lower versus usual or modified fat intake may make little or no difference to height at seven years (MD -0.60 cm, 95% CI -2.06 to 0.86; 1 RCT; n = 577; low-quality evidence).Associations between total fat intake, weight and body fatness from cohort studiesOver half the cohort analyses that reported on primary outcomes suggested that as total fat intake increases, body fatness measures may move in the same direction. However, heterogeneous methods and reporting across cohort studies, and predominantly very low-quality evidence, made it difficult to draw firm conclusions and true relationships may be substantially different. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We were unable to reach firm conclusions. Limited evidence from three trials that randomised children to dietary counselling or education to lower total fat intake (30% or less TE) versus usual or modified fat intake, but with no intention to reduce weight, showed small reductions in body mass index, total- and LDL-cholesterol at some time points with lower fat intake compared to controls. There were no consistent effects on weight, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or height. Associations in cohort studies that related total fat intake to later measures of body fatness in children were inconsistent and the quality of this evidence was mostly very low. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries, and may not be applicable in low- and middle-income settings. High-quality, longer-term studies are needed, that include low- and middle-income settings to look at both possible benefits and harms.

Trends in hospital admissions at a Department for Infectious Diseases in Italy from 1995 to 2011 and implications for health policies.

BACKGROUND Interactions among several environmental, behavioral, social, and biological variables contribute to the epidemiology of infectious diseases (IDs) and have an impact on the healthcare system and hospitalizations. We evaluated trends in ID hospitalizations at our Department for Infectious Diseases in the last two decades to aid decision-makers in defining appropriate healthcare strategies. METHODS The discharge diagnoses of all patients admitted to the ID Department of L Sacco University Hospital between 1995 and 2011 were classified by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) grouped in Major Diagnostic Categories (MDC). Linear regression was used to determine the trends in hospitalizations for each MDC. Estimates of the average annual change were based on the slope of the regression line. RESULTS A sharp decline in HIV/AIDS cases (-22.5 +/-6.0 cases per calendar year), and an increase in admissions for respiratory, cardiovascular, renal and musculoskeletal infections were recorded. The mean age of the patients increased by 1.2 years (+/-0.049) for each calendar year of observation (linear trend, p < 0.0001), increasing from 37.02 +/-11.91 years in 1995 to 56.02 +/-19.62 years in 2011 (p < 0.0001). The mean number of comorbidities per patient increased significantly over time (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.0153). From 1998/1999 to 2010/2011 the hospital length of stay (LOS) increased for cardiovascular, digestive system, musculoskeletal, and skin/subcutaneous infections, and infectious and parasitic diseases (p < 0.01). The rate of hospital stay over threshold (HSOT) increased in the last 5 years by 1.12% for every 10-year age group. CONCLUSIONS Older age, a higher number of comorbidities, a longer hospital LOS for certain conditions, and a higher rate of HSOT characterize the patients admitted to this ID department in recent years. Despite progress in treatment and management, infectious diseases continue to be a major threat to human health. The current challenge for ID departments is the treatment of complex cases, often associated with chronic diseases in elderly patients. Continuous monitoring at a local and national level will allow early identification of changes in the epidemiological patterns of IDs and provide information for healthcare system planning.

[Recommendations for treatment of severe coronavirus disease 2019 based on critical care ultrasound]

Severe patients with COVID-19 are characterized by persistent lung damage, causing respiratory failure, secondary circulatory changes and multiple organ dysfunction after virus invasion. Because of its dynamic, real-time, non-invasive, repeatable and other advantages, critical ultrasonography can be widely used in the diagnosis, assessment and guidance of treatment for severe patients. Based on the recommendations of critical care experts from all over the country who fight against the epidemic in Wuhan, this article summarizes the guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 based on critical ultrasonography, hoping to provide help for the treatment of severe patients. The recommendations mainly cover the following aspects: (1) lung ultrasound in patients with COVID-19 is mainly manifested by thickened and irregular pleural lines, different types of B-lines, shred signs, and other consolidation like dynamic air bronchogram; (2) Echocardiography may show right heart dysfunction, diffuse cardiac function enhancement, stress cardiomyopathy, diffuse cardiac depression and other multiple abnormalities; (3) Critical ultrasonography helps with initiating early treatment in the suspect patient, screening confirmed patients after intensive care unit admission, early assessment of sudden critical events, rapid grading assessment and treatment based on it; (4) Critical ultrasonography helps to quickly screen for the etiology of respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19, make oxygen therapeutic strategy, guide the implementation of lung protective ventilation, graded management and precise off-ventilator; (5) Critical ultrasonography is helpful for assessing the circulatory status of patients with COVID-19, finding chronic cardiopulmonary diseases and guiding extracorporeal membrane oxygenation management; (6) Critical ultrasonography Contributes to the management of organs besides based on cardiopulmonary oxygen transport; (7) Critical ultrasonography can help to improve the success of operation; (8) Critical ultrasonography can help to improve the safety and quality of nursing; (9) When performing critical ultrasonography for patients with COVID-19, it needs to implement three-level protection standard, pay attention to disinfect the machine and strictly obey the rules from nosocomial infection. (10) Telemedicine and artificial intelligence centered on critical ultrasonography may help to improve the efficiency of treatment for the patients with COVID-19.In the face of the global spread of the epidemic, all we can do is to share experience, build a defense line, We hope this recommendations can help COVID-19patients therapy.

Frequency of molecular detection of equine coronavirus in faeces and nasal secretions in 277 horses with acute onset of fever.

CONTEXT Due to the inconsistent development of enteric signs associated with ECoV infection in adult horses, many practitioners collect nasal secretions rather than feces for the molecular diagnostic work-up of such horses. MAIN CONCLUSION ECoV infection should be considered in horses presenting with acute onset of fever, especially when nasal discharge is absent as one of the cardinal clinical sign. APPROACH A total of 277 adult horses with acute onset of fever were enrolled in this study. Feces were tested for ECoV and nasal secretions for common respiratory pathogens (equine herpesvirus (EHV)-1, EHV-4, equine influenza virus (EIV), equine rhinitis viruses (ERVs) and Streptococcus equi ss. equi) and ECoV by qPCR. Each submission was accompanied by a questionnaire requesting information pertaining to signalment, use, recent transportation, number of affected horses on the premise and presence of clinical signs at the time of sample collection. RESULTS The total number of horses testing qPCR-positive for ECoV in feces was 20 (7.2%), 4 of which also tested qPCR-positive for ECoV in nasal secretions. In the same population 9.0% of horses tested qPCR-positive for EHV-4, 6.1% for EIV, 4.3% for Streptococcus equi ss. equi, 3.2% for ERVs and 0.7% for EHV-1. Draft horses, pleasure use, multiple horses affected on a premise and lack of nasal discharge were significantly associated with ECoV qPCR-positive horses. INTERPRETATION The present study results showed that 7.2% of horses with acute onset of fever tested qPCR-positive for ECoV in feces, highlighting the importance of testing such horses for ECoV in feces. The various prevalence factors associated with ECoV qPCR-positive status likely relate to the high infectious nature of ECoV and breed-specific differences in management and husbandry practices. SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS ECoV infection should be suspected and tested for in horses presenting with acute onset of fever, lethargy and anorexia with no respiratory signs. A two-step approach should be consider in which respiratory secretions and feces should be collected from such horses and submitted to a diagnostic laboratory. If the respiratory secretions test negative by qPCR for a panel of respiratory pathogens, feces already submitted to the laboratory should be tested for ECoV.

Case Fatality Rates Based on Population Estimates of Influenza-Like Illness Due to Novel H1N1 Influenza: New York City, May–June 2009

BACKGROUND: The public health response to pandemic influenza is contingent on the pandemic strain's severity. In late April 2009, a potentially pandemic novel H1N1 influenza strain (nH1N1) was recognized. New York City (NYC) experienced an intensive initial outbreak that peaked in late May, providing the need and opportunity to rapidly quantify the severity of nH1N1. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Telephone surveys using rapid polling methods of approximately 1,000 households each were conducted May 20–27 and June 15–19, 2009. Respondents were asked about the occurrence of influenza-like illness (ILI, fever with either cough or sore throat) for each household member from May 1–27 (survey 1) or the preceding 30 days (survey 2). For the overlap period, prevalence data were combined by weighting the survey-specific contribution based on a Serfling model using data from the NYC syndromic surveillance system. Total and age-specific prevalence of ILI attributed to nH1N1 were estimated using two approaches to adjust for background ILI: discounting by ILI prevalence in less affected NYC boroughs and by ILI measured in syndromic surveillance data from 2004–2008. Deaths, hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions were determined from enhanced surveillance including nH1N1-specific testing. Combined ILI prevalence for the 50-day period was 15.8% (95% CI:13.2%–19.0%). The two methods of adjustment yielded point estimates of nH1N1-associated ILI of 7.8% and 12.2%. Overall case-fatality (CFR) estimates ranged from 0.054–0.086 per 1000 persons with nH1N1-associated ILI and were highest for persons ≥65 years (0.094–0.147 per 1000) and lowest for those 0–17 (0.008–0.012). Hospitalization rates ranged from 0.84–1.34 and ICU admission rates from 0.21–0.34 per 1000, with little variation in either by age-group. CONCLUSIONS: ILI prevalence can be quickly estimated using rapid telephone surveys, using syndromic surveillance data to determine expected “background” ILI proportion. Risk of severe illness due to nH1N1 was similar to seasonal influenza, enabling NYC to emphasize preventing severe morbidity rather than employing aggressive community mitigation measures.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus S1 protein is the critical inducer of apoptosis

BACKGROUND: Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (PED) is an acute and highly contagious enteric disease caused by PED virus (PEDV), characterized by vomitting, watery diarrhea and fatal dehydration with high mortality in sucking piglets of one week of age. Although PEDV induced cell apoptosis has been established in vitro and in vivo, the functional protein that contributes to this event remains unclear. METHODS: The activation or cleavage of main apoptosis-associated molecular such as AIFM1, caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9 and PARP in PEDV infected host cells were analyzed by western blotting. The nuclear change of infected cell was monitored by confocal immunofluorescence assay. The overexpressing plasmids of 16 non-structural proteins (Nsp1–16) and 6 structural proteins (M, N, E, ORF3, S1 and S2) were constructed by cloning. Cell apoptosis induced by PEDV or overexpression non-structural or structural proteins was measured by the flow cytometry assay. RESULTS: PEDV could infect various host cells including Vero, Vero-E6 and Marc-145 and cause obvious cytopathic effects, including roundup, cell fusion, cell membrane vacuolation, syncytium formation and cause apparent apoptosis. In infected cells, PEDV-induced apoptosis is accompanied by nuclear concentration and fragmentation as a result of caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation and AIFM1 and PARP cleavage. Overexpression of S1 Spike protein of PEDV SM98 strain effectively induced host cell apoptosis, while the expression of the other non-structure proteins (Nsp1–16) and structural proteins (M, N, E, S2 and ORF3) has no or less effect on cell apoptosis. Similarly, expression of S1 protein from wild-type strain BJ2011 or cell-adapted strain CV777, also induce apoptosis in transfected cells. Finally, we demonstrated that the S1 proteins from various coronavirus family members such as TGEV, IBV, CCoV, SARS and MERS could also induce Vero-E6 cells apoptosis. CONCLUSION: S1 Spike protein is one of the most critical functional proteins that contribute to cell apoptosis. Expression of S1 proteins of the coronavirus tested in this study could all induce cell apoptosis suggesting S1 maybe is an effective inducer in Coronavirus-induced cell apoptosis and targeting S1 protein expression probably is a promising strategy to inhibit coronavirus infection and thus mediated apoptosis on host cells.

Structural parameterization and functional prediction of antigenic polypeptome sequences with biological activity through quantitative sequence-activity models (QSAM) by molecular electronegativity edge-distance vector (VMED)

Only from the primary structures of peptides, a new set of descriptors called the molecular electronegativity edge-distance vector (VMED) was proposed and applied to describing and characterizing the molecular structures of oligopeptides and polypeptides, based on the electronegativity of each atom or electronic charge index (ECI) of atomic clusters and the bonding distance between atom-pairs. Here, the molecular structures of antigenic polypeptides were well expressed in order to propose the automated technique for the computerized identification of helper T lymphocyte (Th) epitopes. Furthermore, a modified MED vector was proposed from the primary structures of polypeptides, based on the ECI and the relative bonding distance of the fundamental skeleton groups. The side-chains of each amino acid were here treated as a pseudo-atom. The developed VMED was easy to calculate and able to work. Some quantitative model was established for 28 immunogenic or antigenic polypeptides (AGPP) with 14 (1–14) A(d) and 14 other restricted activities assigned as “1”(+) and “0”(−), respectively. The latter comprised 6 A(b)(15–20), 3 A(k)(21–23), 2 E(k)(24–26), 2 H-2(k)(27 and 28) restricted sequences. Good results were obtained with 90% correct classification (only 2 wrong ones for 20 training samples) and 100% correct prediction (none wrong for 8 testing samples); while contrastively 100% correct classification (none wrong for 20 training samples) and 88% correct classification (1 wrong for 8 testing samples). Both stochastic samplings and cross validations were performed to demonstrate good performance. The described method may also be suitable for estimation and prediction of classes I and II for major histocompatibility antigen (MHC) epitope of human. It will be useful in immune identification and recognition of proteins and genes and in the design and development of subunit vaccines. Several quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models were developed for various oligopeptides and polypeptides including 58 dipeptides and 31 pentapeptides with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by multiple linear regression (MLR) method. In order to explain the ability to characterize molecular structure of polypeptides, a molecular modeling investigation on QSAR was performed for functional prediction of polypeptide sequences with antigenic activity and heptapeptide sequences with tachykinin activity through quantitative sequence-activity models (QSAMs) by the molecular electronegativity edge-distance vector (VMED). The results showed that VMED exhibited both excellent structural selectivity and good activity prediction. Moreover, the results showed that VMED behaved quite well for both QSAR and QSAM of poly-and oligopeptides, which exhibited both good estimation ability and prediction power, equal to or better than those reported in the previous references. Finally, a preliminary conclusion was drwan: both classical and modified MED vectors were very useful structural descriptors. Some suggestions were proposed for further studies on QSAR/QSAM of proteins in various fields.

Characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women admitted to hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in UK: national population based cohort study

OBJECTIVES: To describe a national cohort of pregnant women admitted to hospital with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the UK, identify factors associated with infection, and describe outcomes, including transmission of infection, for mothers and infants. DESIGN: Prospective national population based cohort study using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS). SETTING: All 194 obstetric units in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 427 pregnant women admitted to hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 March 2020 and 14 April 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of maternal hospital admission and infant infection. Rates of maternal death, level 3 critical care unit admission, fetal loss, caesarean birth, preterm birth, stillbirth, early neonatal death, and neonatal unit admission. RESULTS: The estimated incidence of admission to hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy was 4.9 (95% confidence interval 4.5 to 5.4) per 1000 maternities. 233 (56%) pregnant women admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy were from black or other ethnic minority groups, 281 (69%) were overweight or obese, 175 (41%) were aged 35 or over, and 145 (34%) had pre-existing comorbidities. 266 (62%) women gave birth or had a pregnancy loss; 196 (73%) gave birth at term. Forty one (10%) women admitted to hospital needed respiratory support, and five (1%) women died. Twelve (5%) of 265 infants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, six of them within the first 12 hours after birth. CONCLUSIONS: Most pregnant women admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection were in the late second or third trimester, supporting guidance for continued social distancing measures in later pregnancy. Most had good outcomes, and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to infants was uncommon. The high proportion of women from black or minority ethnic groups admitted with infection needs urgent investigation and explanation. STUDY REGISTRATION: ISRCTN 40092247.

Efficiency of a mechanical device in controlling tracheal cuff pressure in intubated critically ill patients: a randomized controlled study.

BACKGROUND Cuff pressure (P cuff) control is mandatory to avoid leakage of oral secretions passing the tracheal tube and tracheal ischemia. The aim of the present trial was to determine the efficacy of a mechanical device (PressureEasy®) in the continuous control of P cuff in patients intubated with polyvinyl chloride (PVC)-cuffed tracheal tubes, compared with routine care using a manometer. METHODS This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, cross-over study. All patients requiring intubation with a predicted duration of mechanical ventilation ≥48 h were eligible. Eighteen patients randomly received continuous control of P cuff with PressureEasy® device for 24 h, followed by discontinuous control (every 4 h) with a manual manometer for 24 h, or vice versa. P cuff and airway pressure were continuously recorded. P cuff target was 25 cmH2O during the two periods. RESULTS The percentage of time spent with P cuff 20-30 cmH2O (median (IQR) 34 % (17-57) versus 50 % (35-64), p = 0.184) and the percentage of time spent with P cuff <20 cmH2O (23 % (5-63) versus 43 % (16-60), p = 0.5) were similar during continuous control of P cuff and routine care, respectively. However, the percentage of time spent with P cuff >30 cmH2O was significantly higher during continuous control compared with routine care of tracheal cuff (26 % (14-39) versus 7 % (1-18), p = 0.002). No significant difference was found in P cuff (25 (18-28) versus 21 (18-26), p = 0.17), mean airway pressure (14 (10-17) versus 14 (11-16), p = 0.679), or coefficient of variation of P cuff (19 % (11-26) versus 20 % (11-25), p = 0.679) during continuous control compared with routine care of tracheal cuff, respectively. CONCLUSIONS PressureEasy® did not demonstrate a better control of P cuff between 20 and 30 cmH2O, compared with routine care using a manometer. Moreover, the device use resulted in significantly higher time spent with overinflation of tracheal cuff, which might increase the risk for tracheal ischemic lesions.

Comparative outcomes of catheter-directed thrombolysis plus anticoagulation vs anticoagulation alone to treat lower-extremity proximal deep vein thrombosis.

IMPORTANCE The role of catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) in the treatment of acute proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is controversial, and the nationwide safety outcomes are unknown. OBJECTIVES The primary objective was to compare in-hospital outcomes of CDT plus anticoagulation with those of anticoagulation alone. The secondary objective was to evaluate the temporal trends in the utilization and outcomes of CDT in the treatment of proximal DVT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Observational study of patients with a principal discharge diagnosis of proximal or caval DVT from 2005 to 2010 in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. We compared patients treated with CDT plus anticoagulation with the patients treated with anticoagulation alone. We used propensity scores to construct 2 matched groups of 3594 patients in each group for comparative outcomes analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary study outcome was in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes included bleeding complications, length of stay, and hospital charges. RESULTS Among a total of 90,618 patients hospitalized for DVT (national estimate of 449,200 hospitalizations), 3649 (4.1%) underwent CDT. The CDT utilization rates increased from 2.3% in 2005 to 5.9% in 2010. Based on the propensity-matched comparison, the in-hospital mortality was not significantly different between the CDT and the anticoagulation groups (1.2% vs 0.9%) (OR, 1.40 [95% CI, 0.88-2.25]) (P = .15). The rates of blood transfusion (11.1% vs 6.5%) (OR, 1.85 [95% CI, 1.57-2.20]) (P < .001), pulmonary embolism (17.9% vs 11.4%) (OR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.49-1.94]) (P < .001), intracranial hemorrhage (0.9% vs 0.3%) (OR, 2.72 [95% CI, 1.40-5.30]) (P = .03), and vena cava filter placement (34.8% vs 15.6%) (OR, 2.89 [95% CI, 2.58-3.23]) (P < .001) were significantly higher in the CDT group. The CDT group had longer mean (SD) length of stay (7.2 [5.8] vs 5.0 [4.7] days) (OR, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.49-1.94]) (P < .001) and higher hospital charges ($85,094 [$69,121] vs $28,164 [$42,067]) (P < .001) compared with the anticoagulation group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, we did not find any difference in the mortality between the CDT and the anticoagulation groups, but evidence of higher adverse events was noted in the CDT group. In the context of this observational data and continued improvements in technology, a randomized trial with outcomes such as mortality and postthrombotic syndrome is needed to definitively address this comparative effectiveness.

Bone marrow dosimetry in peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with [177Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate.

PURPOSE Adequate dosimetry is mandatory for effective and safe peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). Besides the kidneys, the bone marrow is a potentially dose-limiting organ. The radiation dose to the bone marrow is usually calculated according to the MIRD scheme, where the accumulated activity in the bone marrow is calculated from the accumulated radioactivity of the radiopharmaceutical in the blood. This may underestimate the absorbed dose since stem cells express somatostatin receptors. We verified the blood-based method by comparing the activity in the blood with the radioactivity in bone marrow aspirates. Also, we evaluated the absorbed cross-dose from the source organs (liver, spleen, kidneys and blood), tumours and the so-called "remainder of the body" to the bone marrow. METHODS Bone marrow aspirates were drawn in 15 patients after treatment with [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate. Radioactivity in the bone marrow was compared with radioactivity in the blood drawn simultaneously. The nucleated cell fraction was isolated from the bone marrow aspirate and radioactivity was measured. The absorbed dose to the bone marrow was calculated. The results were correlated to the change in platelet counts 6 weeks after treatment. RESULTS A strong linear correlation and high agreement between the measured radioactivities in the bone marrow aspirates and in the blood was found (r=0.914, p<0.001). No correlation between the calculated absorbed dose in the bone marrow and the change in platelets was found. There was a considerable contribution from other organs and the remainder of the body to the bone marrow absorbed dose. CONCLUSION (1) After PRRT with [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate, the radioactivity concentration in the bone marrow is identical to that in the blood; (2) There is no significant binding of the radiopharmaceutical to bone marrow precursor stem cells; (3) The contribution of the cross dose from source organs and tumours to the bone marrow dose is significant; and (4) There is considerable variation in bone marrow absorbed dose between patients. These findings imply that for individual dose optimization, individual calculation of the bone marrow absorbed dose is necessary.

Characterization of Rotavirus RNAs That Activate Innate Immune Signaling through the RIG-I-Like Receptors

In mammalian cells, the first line of defense against viral pathogens is the innate immune response, which is characterized by induction of type I interferons (IFN) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines that establish an antiviral milieu both in infected cells and in neighboring uninfected cells. Rotavirus, a double-stranded RNA virus of the Reoviridae family, is the primary etiological agent of severe diarrhea in young children worldwide. Previous studies demonstrated that rotavirus replication induces a MAVS-dependent type I IFN response that involves both RIG-I and MDA5, two cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors. This study reports the isolation and characterization of rotavirus RNAs that activate IFN signaling. Using an in vitro approach with purified rotavirus double-layer particles, nascent single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) transcripts (termed in vitro ssRNA) were found to be potent IFN inducers. In addition, large RNAs isolated from rotavirus-infected cells six hours post-infection (termed in vivo 6 hr large RNAs), also activated IFN signaling, whereas a comparable large RNA fraction isolated from cells infected for only one hour lacked this stimulatory activity. Experiments using knockout murine embryonic fibroblasts showed that RIG-I is required for and MDA5 partly contributes to innate immune signaling by both in vitro ssRNA and in vivo 6 hr large RNAs. Enzymatic studies demonstrated that in vitro ssRNA and in vivo 6 hr large RNA samples contain uncapped RNAs with exposed 5’ phosphate groups. RNAs lacking 2’-O-methylated 5’ cap structures were also detected in the in vivo 6 hr large RNA sample. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence that the rotavirus VP3 enzyme, which encodes both guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase activities, is not completely efficient at either 5’ capping or 2’-O-methylation of the 5’ cap structures of viral transcripts, and in this way produces RNA patterns that activate innate immune signaling through the RIG-I-like receptors.

Mental Health, Risk Factors, and Social Media Use During the COVID-19 Epidemic and Cordon Sanitaire Among the Community and Health Professionals in Wuhan, China: Cross-Sectional Survey

BACKGROUND: The mental health consequences of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, community-wide interventions, and social media use during a pandemic are unclear. The first and most draconian interventions have been implemented in Wuhan, China, and these countermeasures have been increasingly deployed by countries around the world. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine risk factors, including the use of social media, for probable anxiety and depression in the community and among health professionals in the epicenter, Wuhan, China. METHODS: We conducted an online survey via WeChat, the most widely used social media platform in China, which was administered to 1577 community-based adults and 214 health professionals in Wuhan. Probable anxiety and probable depression were assessed by the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (cutoff ≥3) and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (cutoff ≥3), respectively. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with probable anxiety and probable depression. RESULTS: Of the 1577 community-based adults, about one-fifth of respondents reported probable anxiety (n=376, 23.84%, 95% CI 21.8-26.0) and probable depression (n=303, 19.21%, 95% CI 17.3-21.2). Similarly, of the 214 health professionals, about one-fifth of surveyed health professionals reported probable anxiety (n=47, 22.0%, 95% CI 16.6-28.1) or probable depression (n=41, 19.2%, 95% CI 14.1-25.1). Around one-third of community-based adults and health professionals spent ≥2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media. Close contact with individuals with COVID-19 and spending ≥2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media were associated with probable anxiety and depression in community-based adults. Social support was associated with less probable anxiety and depression in both health professionals and community-based adults. CONCLUSIONS: The internet could be harnessed for telemedicine and restoring daily routines, yet caution is warranted toward spending excessive time searching for COVID-19 news on social media given the infodemic and emotional contagion through online social networks. Online platforms may be used to monitor the toll of the pandemic on mental health.

Concept design and simulation study on a "phantom" anvil for circular stapler.

INTRODUCTION Complications and challenges arising from the intraoperative double-stapling technique are seldom reported in colorectal surgery literature. Partial or full-thickness rectal injuries can occur during the introduction and the advancement of the circular stapler along the upper rectum. The aim of this study is to address some of these issues by designing and optimizing a "phantom" anvil manufactured to overcome difficulties throughout the rectal introduction and advancement of the circular stapler for the treatment of benign and malignant colon disease. METHODS The design of the "phantom" anvil has been performed using computer-aided modeling techniques, finite element investigations, and 2 essential keynotes in mind. The first one is the internal shape of the anvil, which is used for the connection to the gun. The second is the shape of the cap, which makes possible the insertion of the gun through the rectum. The "phantom" anvil has 2 functional requirements, which have been taken into account. The design has been optimized to avoid colorectal injuries, neoplastic dissemination (ie, mechanical seeding) and to reduce the fecal contamination. RESULTS Numerical simulations show that a right combination of both top and bottom fillet radii of the shape of the anvil can reduce the stress for the considered anatomic configuration of >90%. Both the fillet radii at the top and the bottom of the device influence the local stress of the colon rectum. CONCLUSIONS A dismountable device, which is used only for the insertion and advancement of the stapler, allows a dedicated design of its shape, keeping the remainder of the stapler unmodified. Computer-aided simulations are useful to perform numerical investigations to optimize the design of this auxiliary part for both the safety of the patient and the ease of the stapler advancement through the rectum.

Influence of fibrin sealant in preventing postoperative seroma and normalizing the abdominal wall after laparoscopic repair of ventral hernia.

BACKGROUND Seroma after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) has been related to certain complications of the technique, such as recurrences and postoperative pain. The aim of this study was to assess whether percutaneous application of fibrin sealant in the hernia sac after LVHR reduces the incidence and volume of the postoperative seroma, and to analyze whether the percentage of patients achieving complete normalization of the abdominal wall increases. METHODS Prospective and comparative study. Patients were distributed into 2 control-case groups. Group 1 comprised patients submitted to LVHR using the double crown technique and a compressing bandage as the only method for prevent seroma. Group 2 comprised patients admitted to LVHR using the same technique together with percutaneous injection of fibrin sealant in the sac, and later applying the same bandage. Patients were examined clinically and radiologically at 7 days, 1 month, and 3 months after surgery. RESULTS Twenty-five patients were included in each group. There were significant differences in the incidence of seroma by the day 7 after surgery (92% in group 1 vs. 64 % in group 2, p = 0.017) and by 1 month (72% in group 1 vs. 28% in group 2, p = 0.002). The difference was also significant regarding the achievement of normalization of the abdominal wall by day 7 (24% in group 1 vs. 52% in group 2, p = 0.041) and by month 1 (64% in group 1 vs. 88% in group 2, p = 0.047) after operation. Volume of seroma was larger among patients of group 1 after the week (p = 0.002) and 1 month after operation (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Fibrin sealant application after LVHR reduces the incidence and volume of the seroma 7 days and 1 month after surgery. The treated patients obtain a larger normalization of the abdominal wall 1 week and 1 month after the operation.

Dinucleotide Composition in Animal RNA Viruses Is Shaped More by Virus Family than by Host Species.

Viruses use the cellular machinery of their hosts for replication. It has therefore been proposed that the nucleotide and dinucleotide compositions of viruses should match those of their host species. If this is upheld, it may then be possible to use dinucleotide composition to predict the true host species of viruses sampled in metagenomic surveys. However, it is also clear that different taxonomic groups of viruses tend to have distinctive patterns of dinucleotide composition that may be independent of host species. To determine the relative strength of the effect of host versus virus family in shaping dinucleotide composition, we performed a comparative analysis of 20 RNA virus families from 15 host groupings, spanning two animal phyla and more than 900 virus species. In particular, we determined the odds ratios for the 16 possible dinucleotides and performed a discriminant analysis to evaluate the capability of virus dinucleotide composition to predict the correct virus family or host taxon from which it was isolated. Notably, while 81% of the data analyzed here were predicted to the correct virus family, only 62% of these data were predicted to their correct subphylum/class host and a mere 32% to their correct mammalian order. Similarly, dinucleotide composition has a weak predictive power for different hosts within individual virus families. We therefore conclude that dinucleotide composition is generally uniform within a virus family but less well reflects that of its host species. This has obvious implications for attempts to accurately predict host species from virus genome sequences alone.IMPORTANCE Determining the processes that shape virus genomes is central to understanding virus evolution and emergence. One question of particular importance is why nucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies differ so markedly between viruses. In particular, it is currently unclear whether host species or virus family has the biggest impact on dinucleotide frequencies and whether dinucleotide composition can be used to accurately predict host species. Using a comparative analysis, we show that dinucleotide composition has a strong phylogenetic association across different RNA virus families, such that dinucleotide composition can predict the family from which a virus sequence has been isolated. Conversely, dinucleotide composition has a poorer predictive power for the different host species within a virus family and across different virus families, indicating that the host has a relatively small impact on the dinucleotide composition of a virus genome.

Identification of the catalytic sites of a papain-like cysteine proteinase of murine coronavirus.

The murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus gene 1 is expressed as a polyprotein, which is cleaved into multiple proteins posttranslationally. One of the proteins is p28, which represents the amino-terminal portion of the polyprotein and is presumably generated by the activity of an autoproteinase domain of the polyprotein (S. C. Baker, C. K. Shieh, L. H. Soe, M.-F. Chang, D. M. Vannier, and M. M. C. Lai, J. Virol. 63:3693-3699, 1989). In this study, the boundaries and the critical amino acid residues of this putative proteinase domain were characterized by deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis. Proteinase activity was monitored by examining the generation of p28 during in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Deletion analysis defined the proteinase domain to be within the sequences encoded from the 3.6- to 4.4-kb region from the 5' end of the genome. A 0.7-kb region between the substrate (p28) and proteinase domain could be deleted without affecting the proteolytic cleavage. However, a larger deletion (1.6 kb) resulted in the loss of proteinase activity, suggesting the importance of spacing sequences between proteinase and substrate. Computer-assisted analysis of the amino acid sequence of the proteinase domain identified potential catalytic cysteine and histidine residues in a stretch of sequence distantly related to papain-like cysteine proteinases. The role of these putative catalytic residues in the proteinase activity was studied by site-specific mutagenesis. Mutations of Cys-1137 or His-1288 led to a complete loss of proteinase activity, implicating these residues as essential for the catalytic activity. In contrast, most mutations of His-1317 or Cys-1172 had no or only minor effects on proteinase activity. This study establishes that mouse hepatitis virus gene 1 encodes a proteinase domain, in the region from 3.6 to 4.4 kb from the 5' end of the genome, which resembles members of the papain family of cysteine proteinases and that this proteinase domain is responsible for the cleavage of the N-terminal peptide.

Ebola virus disease in West Africa--the first 9 months of the epidemic and forward projections.

BACKGROUND On March 23, 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Guinea. On August 8, the WHO declared the epidemic to be a "public health emergency of international concern." METHODS By September 14, 2014, a total of 4507 probable and confirmed cases, including 2296 deaths from EVD (Zaire species) had been reported from five countries in West Africa--Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. We analyzed a detailed subset of data on 3343 confirmed and 667 probable Ebola cases collected in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone as of September 14. RESULTS The majority of patients are 15 to 44 years of age (49.9% male), and we estimate that the case fatality rate is 70.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69 to 73) among persons with known clinical outcome of infection. The course of infection, including signs and symptoms, incubation period (11.4 days), and serial interval (15.3 days), is similar to that reported in previous outbreaks of EVD. On the basis of the initial periods of exponential growth, the estimated basic reproduction numbers (R0 ) are 1.71 (95% CI, 1.44 to 2.01) for Guinea, 1.83 (95% CI, 1.72 to 1.94) for Liberia, and 2.02 (95% CI, 1.79 to 2.26) for Sierra Leone. The estimated current reproduction numbers (R) are 1.81 (95% CI, 1.60 to 2.03) for Guinea, 1.51 (95% CI, 1.41 to 1.60) for Liberia, and 1.38 (95% CI, 1.27 to 1.51) for Sierra Leone; the corresponding doubling times are 15.7 days (95% CI, 12.9 to 20.3) for Guinea, 23.6 days (95% CI, 20.2 to 28.2) for Liberia, and 30.2 days (95% CI, 23.6 to 42.3) for Sierra Leone. Assuming no change in the control measures for this epidemic, by November 2, 2014, the cumulative reported numbers of confirmed and probable cases are predicted to be 5740 in Guinea, 9890 in Liberia, and 5000 in Sierra Leone, exceeding 20,000 in total. CONCLUSIONS These data indicate that without drastic improvements in control measures, the numbers of cases of and deaths from EVD are expected to continue increasing from hundreds to thousands per week in the coming months.

Changes in leg cycling muscle synergies after training augmented by functional electrical stimulation in subacute stroke survivors: a pilot study.

BACKGROUND Muscle synergies analysis can provide a deep understanding of motor impairment after stroke and of changes after rehabilitation. In this study, the neuro-mechanical analysis of leg cycling was used to longitudinally investigate the motor recovery process coupled with cycling training augmented by Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) in subacute stroke survivors. METHODS Subjects with ischemic subacute stroke participated in a 3-week training of FES-cycling with visual biofeedback plus usual care. Participants were evaluated before and after the intervention through clinical scales, gait spatio-temporal parameters derived from an instrumented mat, and a voluntary pedaling test. Biomechanical metrics (work produced by the two legs, mechanical effectiveness and symmetry indexes) and bilateral electromyography from 9 leg muscles were acquired during the voluntary pedaling test. To extract muscles synergies, the Weighted Nonnegative Matrix Factorization algorithm was applied to the normalized EMG envelopes. Synergy complexity was measured by the number of synergies required to explain more than 90% of the total variance of the normalized EMG envelopes and variance accounted for by one synergy. Regardless the inter-subject differences in the number of extracted synergies, 4 synergies were extracted from each patient and the cosine-similarity between patients and healthy weight vectors was computed. RESULTS Nine patients (median age of 75 years and median time post-stroke of 2 weeks) were recruited. Significant improvements in terms of clinical scales, gait parameters and work produced by the affected leg were obtained after training. Synergy complexity well correlated to the level of motor impairment at baseline, but it did not change after training. We found a significant improvement in the similarity of the synergy responsible of the knee flexion during the pulling phase of the pedaling cycle, which was the mostly compromised at baseline. This improvement may indicate the re-learning of a more physiological motor strategy. CONCLUSIONS Our findings support the use of the neuro-mechanical analysis of cycling as a method to assess motor recovery after stroke, mainly in an early phase, when gait evaluation is not yet possible. The improvement in the modular coordination of pedaling correlated with the improvement in motor functions and walking ability achieved at the end of the intervention support the role of FES-cycling in enhancing motor re-learning after stroke but need to be confirmed in a controlled study with a larger sample size.

Early trends for SARS-CoV-2 infection in central and north Texas and impact on other circulating respiratory viruses

Rapid diagnosis and isolation are key to containing the quick spread of a pandemic agent like severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has spread globally since its initial outbreak in Wuhan province in China. SARS-CoV-2 is novel and the effect on typically prevalent seasonal viruses is just becoming apparent. We present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of March 2020. This is a retrospective cohort study post launching of SARS-CoV-2 testing at Baylor Scott and White Hospital (BSWH), Temple, Texas. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay and results were shared with State public health officials for immediate interventions. More than 3500 tests were performed during the first 2 weeks of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and identified 168 (4.7%) positive patients. Sixty-two (3.2%) of the 1912 ambulatory patients and 106 (6.3%) of the 1659 emergency department/inpatients tested were positive. The highest rate of infection (6.9%) was seen in patients aged 25 to 34 years, while the lowest rate of infection was seen among patients aged <25 years old (2%). County-specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions. Incidentally, this study showed that there was a significant decrease in the occurrence of seasonal respiratory virus infections, perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness about SARS-CoV-2 among the general public, as well as the social distancing measures implemented in response to SARS-CoV-2. Data extracted for BSWH from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System site revealed that Influenza incidence was 8.7% in March 2020, compared with 25% in March 2019. This study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management. This study provided SARS-CoV-2 testing data from ambulatory and inpatient population. Epidemiological interventions depend on timely availability of accurate diagnostic tests and throughput capacity of such systems during large outbreaks like SARS-CoV-2.

Effect of minimized perfusion circuit on brain injury markers carnosinase and brain-type fatty binding protein in coronary artery bypass grafting patients.

A minimized perfusion circuit (MPC) has proven to be superior to the conventional circulatory perfusion bypass (CCPB) as it reduces the blood-material interaction and hemodilution. Until now not much is known about impact these different perfusion systems have on the brain. The objective of this study is to determine carnosinase and brain-type fatty binding protein (BFABP) activity as novel specific biomarkers for ischemic brain tissue damage and how their activity differs during and after MPC and CCPB as well as to compare the inflammatory response of both perfusion systems. In a prospective pilot study, 28 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were randomly divided into an MPC group (n = 14) and a CCPB group (n = 14). Blood samples were taken before, during, and after operation until the fifth postoperative day. The brain biomarker carnosinase was determined by measuring the rate of histidine production from the substrate homocarnosine, whereas BFABP and interleukin-6 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). C-reactive protein (CRP) and endothelin-1 were determined by enzyme immunoassay. The mean serum carnosinase activity was significantly higher in MPC (0.57 ± 0.34 nM histidine/mL/min) as compared with the CCPB group (0.36 ± 0.13 nM histidine/mL/min) at the end of operation (P = 0.02). The BFABP did not show any difference between the two groups in the immediate postoperative period until the second postoperative day. From that time point onward, it showed a steep increase in the CCPB group (581.3 ± 157.11 pg/mL) as compared with the concentrations in the MPC group (384.6 ± 39 pg/mL) (P = 0.04). The inflammation markers interleukin-6 and CRP showed a similar pattern in both groups without significant difference. In contrast, the leukocyte count on operation day and endothelin-1 on the first postoperative day were significantly higher in the CCPB group (P = 0.01, P = 0.03, respectively). MPC showed a significant higher and stable serum carnosinase activity during extracorporeal circulation as compared with the CCPB due to less hemodilution and a better preserved oxygen capacity. As a consequence, the antioxidant stress during MPC is limited as compared with CCPB, which means less brain tissue damage reflected by a lower BFABP release. Except endothelin-1 and leukocyte count, the inflammatory response of the MPC and CCPB was equal.

Utilization pattern and side effect profile of oral anticonceptives: A community-based cross-sectional study among Saudi women

BACKGROUND: The rapid change in the socio-demographic pattern and changing beliefs toward fertility and birth spacing have resulted in a notable increase in the use of oral anticonceptives in the Saudi Arabian community. However, information on the current utilization of oral anticonceptives and attitudes toward their use remains sparse. OBJECTIVE: The present study evaluated the utilization pattern of oral anticonceptives, attitude toward pill use, and incidence of side effects among Saudi women. SETTING: The study was conducted in a community setting in Jazan, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Eligible Saudi women routinely using oral anticonceptive pills were invited to participate in this prospective, cross-sectional survey. Data were collected using a standardized, pretested, semi-structured questionnaire. Jazan was selected as it recorded the highest number of women using contraceptives in Saudi Arabia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The pattern of pill utilization, attitude toward pill use, and incidence of side effects. RESULTS: A total of 496 women consented to participate in this study. Most of the respondents (87.5%) were using or had used oral anticonceptives for birth control. In nearly half (49.2%) of participants, oral pills were advised by a gynaecologist, and approximately two-thirds (69.0%) were using or had used combined oral anticonceptives. Nearly two-thirds (63.1%) of respondents preferred pills over other contraception methods due to their ease of use. More than one-third (39.3%) of participants agreed that oral pills are safe. Approximately half (53.2%) of participants were aware that a missed pill must be taken immediately after recalling that a dose was missed. A total of 69.6% of participants experienced at least one side effect, of which mood swings (61.1%), weight gain or increase appetite (42.2%), decreased libido (34.1%), and nausea (31.2%) were most common. CONCLUSION: Saudi women had a high acceptance rate for oral anticonceptives as a legitimate method to prevent unintended pregnancy. This was associated with a modest degree of understanding about their risks and benefits. Pharmacists should provide up-to-date information and counsel patients about the use and side effects of oral anticonceptives.

Protection of dogs against canine distemper by vaccination with a canarypox virus recombinant expressing canine distemper virus fusion and hemagglutinin glycoproteins.

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a live canarypox virus recombinant-canine distemper virus (CDV) combination vaccine against virulent CDV challenge exposure, and to document lack of interference among the other modified-live virus (MLV) components. ANIMALS 33 specific-pathogen-free (SPF) Beagle pups (7 to 10 weeks old). PROCEDURE A canarypox virus recombinant-CDV combination vaccine was tested for safety and efficacy along with MLV components (canine adenovirus type 2, canine coronavirus, canine parainfluenza virus, and canine parvovirus) in 26 SPF Beagle pups. The combination vaccine was rehydrated with either Leptospira canicola-L icterohaemorrhagiae combination bacterin (vaccine 1) or sterile diluent (vaccine 2). An additional group of 7 seronegative SPF pups received the control MLV components devoid of the combination vaccine (vaccine 3). Two vaccinations were administered 21 days apart, either IM or SC. The dose of the combination vaccine used to inoculate these pups was 40 times lower than the recommended commercial dose. At 21 days after the booster vaccination, all pups were challenge exposed with a virulent CDV strain, then were observed for 21 days to record morbidity and mortality. RESULTS Adverse local or generalized reactions were not induced by vaccinations. All vaccinates seroconverted to CDV. Serum antibody titers to MLV components were not different, with or without inclusion of the combination vaccine. After challenge exposure, morbidity and mortality in vaccinates were 0% (0/26); in control dogs, values were 100% morbidity and 86% mortality (6/7). Brain impression smear slides made from all dogs that did not survive challenge exposure were CDV positive by use of a direct fluorescein isothiocyanate method. CONCLUSIONS The canarypox virus-CDV combination vaccine, administered SC or IM, is a safe product that elicits CDV seroconversion, does not interfere with other vaccine components, and protects vaccinated pups against virulent CDV challenge exposure.

Endoscopic endonasal resection of skull base meningiomas: the significance of a "cortical cuff" and brain edema compared with careful case selection and surgical experience in predicting morbidity and extent of resection.

OBJECT This paper describes a consecutive series of skull base meningiomas resected using an endoscopic endonasal approach through various corridors at a single institution over 7 years. The impact of case selection and experience, the presence of a cortical cuff between the tumor and surrounding vessels, and brain edema on morbidity and rates of gross-total resection (GTR) were examined. METHODS A retrospective review of a series of 46 skull base meningiomas from a prospective database was conducted. The series of cases were divided by location: olfactory groove (n = 15), tuberculum and planum (n = 20), sellar/cavernous (n = 9) and petroclival (n = 2). Gross-total resection was never intended in the sellar/cavernous tumors, which generally invaded the cavernous sinus. Clinical charts, volumetric imaging, and pathology were reviewed to assess the extent of resection and complications. Cases were divided based on a time point in which surgical technique and case selection improved into Group 1 (surgery prior to June 2008; n = 21) and Group 2 (surgery after June 2008; n = 25) and into those with and without a cortical cuff and with and without brain edema. RESULTS Improved case selection had the greatest impact on extent of resection. For the entire cohort, rates of GTR went from 38% to 76% (p = 0.02), and for cases in which GTR was the intent, the rates went from 63% to 84% (not significant), which was mostly driven by the planum and tuberculum meningiomas, which went from 75% to 91.7 % (nonsignificant difference). The presence of a cortical cuff and brain edema had no impact on outcomes. There were 3 CSF leaks (6.5%) but all were in Group 1. Hence, CSF leak improved from 14.2% to 0% with surgical experience. Lessons learned for optimal case selection are discussed. CONCLUSIONS Surgical outcome for endonasal endoscopic resection of skull base meningiomas depends mostly on careful case selection and surgical experience. Imaging criteria such as the presence of a cortical cuff or brain edema are less important.

Mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in two longitudinal UK population cohorts

Background: The impact of COVID-19 on mental health is unclear. Evidence from longitudinal studies with pre pandemic data are needed to address (1) how mental health has changed from pre-pandemic levels to during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2), whether there are groups at greater risk of poorer mental health during the pandemic? Methods: We used data from COVID-19 surveys (completed through April/May 2020), nested within two large longitudinal population cohorts with harmonised measures of mental health: two generations of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALPSAC): the index generation ALSPAC-G1 (n= 2850, mean age 28) and the parents generation ALSPAC-G0 (n= 3720, mean age = 59) and Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS, (n= 4233, mean age = 59), both with validated pre-pandemic measures of mental health and baseline factors. To answer question 1, we used ALSPAC-G1, which has identical mental health measures before and during the pandemic. Question 2 was addressed using both studies, using pre-pandemic and COVID-19 specific factors to explore associations with depression and anxiety in COVID-19. Findings: In ALSPAC-G1 there was evidence that anxiety and lower wellbeing, but not depression, had increased in COVID-19 from pre-pandemic assessments. The percentage of individuals with probable anxiety disorder was almost double during COVID-19: 24% (95% CI 23%, 26%) compared to pre-pandemic levels (13%, 95% CI 12%, 14%), with clinically relevant effect sizes. In both ALSPAC and GS, depression and anxiety were greater in younger populations, women, those with pre-existing mental and physical health conditions, those living alone and in socio-economic adversity. We did not detect evidence for elevated risk in key workers or health care workers. Interpretation: These results suggest increases in anxiety and lower wellbeing that may be related to the COVID-19 pandemic and/or its management, particularly in young people. This research highlights that specific groups may be disproportionally at risk of elevated levels of depression and anxiety during COVID-19 and supports recent calls for increasing funds for mental health services.

Role of terminal and anastomotic circulation in the patency of arteries jailed by flow-diverting stents: from hemodynamic changes to ostia surface modifications.

OBJECTIVE The outcome for jailing arterial branches that emerge near intracranial aneurysms during flow-diverting stent (FDS) deployment remains controversial. In this animal study, the authors aimed to elucidate the role of collateral supply with regard to the hemodynamic changes and neointimal modifications that occur from jailing arteries with FDSs. To serve this purpose, the authors sought to quantify 1) the hemodynamic changes that occur at the jailed arterial branches immediately after stent placement and 2) the ostia surface values at 3 months after stenting; both parameters were investigated in the presence or absence of collateral arterial flow. METHODS After an a priori power analysis, 2 groups (Group A and Group B) were created according to an animal flow model for terminal and anastomotic arterial circulation; each group contained 7 Large White swine. Group A animals possessed an anastomotic-type arterial configuration to supply the territory of the right ascending pharyngeal artery (APhA), while Group B animals possessed a terminal-type arterial configuration to supply the right APhA territory. Subsequently, all animals underwent FDS placement, thereby jailing the right APhAs. Mean flow rates and velocities inside the jailed branches were quantified using time-resolved 3D phase-contrast MR angiography before and after stenting. Three months after stent placement, the jailed ostia surface values were quantified on scanning electron micrographs. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and group comparisons with parametric and nonparametric tests. RESULTS The endovascular procedures were feasible, and there were no findings of in situ thrombus formation on postprocedural optical coherence tomography or ischemia on postprocedural diffusion-weighted imaging. In Group A, the mean flow rate values at the jailed right APhAs were reduced immediately following stent placement as compared with values obtained before stent placement (p = 0.02, power: 0.8). In contrast, the mean poststenting flow rates for Group B remained similar to those obtained before stent placement. Three months after stent placement, the mean ostia surface values were significantly higher for Group B (527,911 ± 306,229 μm2) than for Group A (89,329 ± 59,762 μm2; p < 0.01, power: 1.00), even though the initial dimensions of the jailed ostia were similar between groups. A statistically significant correlation was found between groups (A or B), mean flow rates after stent placement, and ostia surface values at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS When an important collateral supply was present, the jailing of side arteries with flow diverters resulted in an immediate and significant reduction in the flow rate inside these arteries as compared with the prestenting values. In contrast, when competitive flow was absent, jailing did not result in significant flow rate reductions inside the jailed arteries. Ostium surface values at 3 months after stent placement were significantly higher in the terminal group of jailed arteries (Group B) than in the anastomotic group (Group A) and strongly correlated with poststenting reductions in the velocity value.

Projecting the Spread of COVID19 for Germany

We model the evolution of the number of individuals that are reported to be sick with COVID-19 in Germany. Our theoretical framework builds on a continuous time Markov chain with four states: healthy without infection, sick, healthy after recovery or after infection but without symptoms and dead. Our quantitative solution matches the number of sick individuals up to the most recent observation and ends with a share of sick individuals following from infection rates and sickness probabilities. We employ this framework to study inter alia the expected peak of the number of sick individuals in a scenario without public regulation of social contacts. We also study the effects of public regulations. For all scenarios we report the expected end of the CoV-2 epidemic. We have four general findings: First, current epidemiological thinking implies that the long-run effects of the epidemic only depend on the aggregate long-run infection rate and on the individual risk to turn sick after an infection. Any measures by individuals and the public therefore only influence the dynamics of spread of CoV-2. Second, predictions about the duration and level of the epidemic must strongly distinguish between the officially reported numbers (Robert Koch Institut, RKI) and actual numbers of sick individuals. Third, given the current (scarce) medical knowledge about long-run infection rate and individual risks to turn sick, any prediction on the length (duration in months) and strength (e.g. maximum numbers of sick individuals on a given day) is subject to a lot of uncertainty. Our predictions therefore offer robustness analyses that provide ranges on how long the epidemic will last and how strong it will be. Fourth, public interventions that are already in place and that are being discussed can lead to more and less severe outcomes of the epidemic. If an intervention takes place too early, the epidemic can actually be stronger than with an intervention that starts later. Interventions should therefore be contingent on current infection rates in regions or countries. Concerning predictions about COVID-19 in Germany, we find that the long-run number of sick individuals (that are reported to the RKI), once the epidemic is over, will lie between 500 thousand and 5 million individuals. While this seems to be an absurdly large range for a precise projection, this reflects the uncertainty about the long-run infection rate in Germany. If we assume that Germany will follow the good scenario of Hubei (and we are even a bit more conservative given discussions about data quality), we will end up with 500 thousand sick individuals over the entire epidemic. If by contrast we believe (as many argue) that once the epidemic is over 70% of the population will have been infected (and thereby immune), we will end up at 5 million cases. Defining the end of the epidemic by less than 100 newly reported sick individuals per day, we find a large variation depending on the effectiveness of governmental pleas and regulations to reduce social contacts. An epidemic that is not influenced by public health measures would end mid June 2020. With public health measures lasting for few weeks, the end is delayed by around one month or two. The advantage of the delay, however, is to reduce the peak number of individuals that are simultaneously sick. When we believe in long-run infection rates of 70%, this number is equally high for all scenarios we went through and well above 1 million. When we can hope for the Hubei-scenario, the maximum number of sick individuals will be around 200 thousand only. Whatever value of the range of long-run infection rates we want to assume, the epidemic will last at least until June, with extensive and potentially future public health measures, it will last until July. In the worst case, it will last until end of August. We emphasize that all projections are subject to uncertainty and permanent monitoring of observed incidences are taken into account to update the projection. The most recent projections are available at https://www.macro.economics.uni-mainz.de/corona-blog/.

Low Abdominal NIRS Values and Elevated Plasma Intestinal Fatty Acid-Binding Protein in a Premature Piglet Model of Necrotizing Enterocolitis.

To identify early markers of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), we hypothesized that continuous abdominal near-infrared spectroscopy (A-NIRS) measurement of splanchnic tissue oxygen saturation and intermittent plasma intestinal fatty-acid binding protein (pI-FABP) measured every 6 hours can detect NEC prior to onset of clinical symptoms. Premature piglets received parenteral nutrition for 48-hours after delivery, followed by enteral feeds every three hours until death or euthanasia at 96-hours. Continuous A-NIRS, systemic oxygen saturation (SpO2), and heart rate were measured while monitoring for clinical signs of NEC. Blood samples obtained at 6-hour intervals were used to determine pI-FABP levels by ELISA. Piglets were classified as fulminant-NEC (f-NEC), non-fulminant-NEC (nf-NEC) and No-NEC according to severity of clinical and histologic features. Of 38 piglets, 37% (n=14) developed nf-NEC, 18% (n=7) developed f-NEC and 45% (n=17) had No-NEC. There were significant differences in baseline heart rate (p=0.008), SpO2 (p<0.001) and A-NIRS (p<0.001) among the three groups. A-NIRS values of NEC piglets remained lower throughout the study with mean for f-NEC of 69±3.8%, 71.9±4.04% for nf-NEC, and 78.4±1.8% for No-NEC piglets (p<0.001). A-NIRS <75% predicted NEC with 97% sensitivity and 97% specificity. NEC piglets demonstrated greater variability from baseline in A-NIRS than healthy piglets (10.1% vs. 6.3%; p=0.04). Mean pI-FABP levels were higher in animals that developed NEC compared to No-NEC piglets (0.66 vs. 0.09 ng/mL;p<0.001). In f-NEC piglets, pI-FABP increased precipitously after feeds (0.04 to 1.87 ng/mL;p<0.001). pI-FABP levels increased in parallel with disease progression and a value >0.25ng/mL identified animals with NEC (68% sensitivity and 90% specificity). NIRS is a real-time, non-invasive tool that can serve as a diagnostic modality for NEC. In premature piglets, low A-NIRS in the early neonatal period and increased variability during initial feeds are highly predictive of NEC, which is then confirmed by rising plasma I-FABP levels. These modalities may help identify neonates with NEC prior to clinical manifestations of disease.

A role for naturally occurring variation of the murine coronavirus spike protein in stabilizing association with the cellular receptor.

Murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus, initiates infection by binding to its cellular receptor (MHVR) via spike (S) proteins projecting from the virion membrane. The structures of these S proteins vary considerably among MHV strains, and this variation is generally considered to be important in determining the strain-specific pathologies of MHV infection, perhaps by affecting the interaction between MHV and the MHVR. To address the relationships between S variation and receptor binding, assays capable of measuring interactions between MHV and MHVR were developed. The assays made use of a novel soluble form of the MHVR, sMHVR-Ig, which comprised the virus-binding immunoglobulin-like domain of MHVR fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1. sMHVR-Ig was stably expressed as a disulfide-linked dimer in human 293 EBNA cells and was immobilized to Sepharose-protein G via the Fc domain. The resulting Sepharose beads were used to adsorb radiolabelled MHV particles. At 4 degrees C, the beads specifically adsorbed two prototype MHV strains, MHV JHM (strain 4) and a tissue culture-adapted mutant of MHV JHM, the JHMX strain. A shift to 37 degrees C resulted in elution of JHM but not JHMX. This in vitro observation of JHM (but not JHMX) elution from its receptor at 37 degrees C was paralleled by a corresponding 37 degrees C elution of receptor-associated JHM (but not JHMX) from tissue culture cells. The basis for this difference in maintenance of receptor association was correlated with a large deletion mutation present within the JHMX S protein, as sMHVR-Ig exhibited relatively thermostable binding to vaccinia virus-expressed S proteins containing the deletion. These results indicate that naturally occurring mutations in the coronavirus S protein affect the stability of the initial interaction with the host cell and thus contribute to the likelihood of successful infection by incoming virions. These changes in virus entry features may result in coronaviruses with novel pathogenic properties.

3D absorbed dose distribution estimated by Monte Carlo simulation in radionuclide therapy with a monoclonal antibody targeting synovial sarcoma.

BACKROUND Radiolabeled OTSA101, a monoclonal antibody targeting synovial sarcoma (SS) developed by OncoTherapy Science, was used to treat relapsing SS metastases following a theranostic procedure: in case of significant 111In-OTSA101 tumor uptake and favorable biodistribution, patient was randomly treated with 370/1110 MBq 90Y-OTSA101. Monte Carlo-based 3D dosimetry integrating time-activity curves in VOI was performed on 111In-OTSA101 repeated SPECT/CT. Estimated absorbed doses (AD) in normal tissues were compared to biological side effects and to the admitted maximal tolerated absorbed dose (MTD) in normal organs. Results in the tumors were also compared to disease evolution. RESULTS Biodistribution and tracer quantification were analyzed on repeated SPECT/CT acquisitions performed after injection of 111In-OTSA101 in 19/20 included patients. SPECT images were warped to a common coordinates system with deformable registration. Volumes of interest (VOI) for various lesions and normal tissues were drawn on the first CT acquisition and reported to all the SPECT images. Tracer quantification and residence time of 111In-OTSA101 in VOI were used to evaluate the estimated absorbed doses per MBq of 90Y-OTSA101 by means of Monte Carlo simulations (GATE). A visual scale analysis was applied to assess tumor uptake (grades 0 to 4) and results were compared to the automated quantification. Results were then compared to biological side effects reported in the selected patients treated with 90Y-OTSA101 but also to disease response to treatment. After screening, 8/20 patients were treated with 370 or 1110 MBq 90Y-OTSA101. All demonstrated medullary toxicity, only one presented with transient grade 3 liver toxicity due to disease progression, and two patients presented with transient grade 1 renal toxicity. Median absorbed doses were the highest in the liver (median, 0.64 cGy/MBq; [0.27 -1.07]) being far lower than the 20 Gy liver MTD, and the lowest in bone marrow (median, 0.09 cGy/MBq; [0.02 -0.18]) being closer to the 2 Gy bone marrow MTD. Most of the patients demonstrated progressive disease on RECIST criteria during patient follow-up. 111In-OTSA101 tumors tracer uptake visually appeared highly heterogeneous in inter- and intra-patient analyses, independently of tumor sizes, with variable kinetics. The majority of visual grades corresponded to the automated computed ones. Estimated absorbed doses in the 95 supra-centimetric selected lesions ranged from 0.01 to 0.71 cGy per injected MBq (median, 0.22 cGy/MBq). The maximal tumor AD obtained was 11.5 Gy. CONCLUSIONS 3D dosimetry results can explain the observed toxicity and tumors response. Despite an intense visual 111In-OTSA101 liver uptake, liver toxicity was not the dose limiting factor conversely to bone marrow toxicity. Even though tumors 111In-OTSA101 avidity was visually obvious for treated patients, the low estimated tumors AD obtained by 3D dosimetry explain the lack of tumor response.

Respiratory Virus Detection and Clinical Diagnosis in Children Attending Day Care

BACKGROUND: Respiratory viruses often have been studied in children with respiratory tract infection (RTI), but less knowledge exists about viruses in asymptomatic children. We have studied the occurrence of a broad panel of respiratory viruses in apparently healthy children attending day care, taking into account the influence of possible confounding factors, such as age, clinical signs of respiratory tract infection (RTI), location (day-care section) and season. METHODS: We have studied 161 children in two day-care centers, each with separate sections for younger and older children, during four autumn and winter visits over a two-year period. A total of 355 clinical examinations were performed, and 343 nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) were analyzed by semi-quantitative, real-time, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for 19 respiratory pathogens. RESULT: Forty-three percent of all NPS were PCR-positive for ≥ 1 of 13 virus species, with high species variation during visits. Rhinovirus 26% (88/343 NPS), enterovirus 12% (40/343) and parechovirus 9% (30/343) were detected in every visit, and the rates varied in relation to age, day-care section and season. Ten other viruses were detected in ≤ 3% of the NPS. Generally, viruses occurred together in the NPS. In 24% (79/331) of the clinical examinations with available NPS, the children had clear signs of RTI, while in 41% (135/331) they had mild signs, and in 35% (117/331) the children had no signs of RTI. Moreover, viruses were found in 70% (55/79) of children with clear signs of RTI, in 41% (55/135) with mild signs and in 30% (35/117) without any signs of RTI (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Positive PCR tests for respiratory viruses, particularly picornaviruses, were frequently detected in apparently healthy children attending day care. Virus detection rates were related to age, presence of clinical signs of RTI, location in day care and season.

Lack of agreement between gross visual and histological assessment of burn reepithelialization in a porcine burn model.

One of the most important and earliest measures of burn healing is wound reepithelialization. Reepithelialization is a vital determinant of wound infection and scarring. Reepithelialization is generally based on gross visual assessment; however, histological assessment remains the criterion standard. We hypothesized that there would be poor agreement (r < .4) between gross visual and histological assessments of burn reepithelialization in a porcine model. The study design was prospective observational using three anesthetized female pigs (20-25 kg). Forty-eight 2.5- × 2.5-cm burns were created on the flanks of pig's using an aluminum bar (150 g) preheated to 80°C for 20 seconds. Burns were treated with an occlusive or antimicrobial dressing and photographed at day 10 for determination of gross percentage reepithelialization in a 1-cm diameter circle in the center of the burn by two experienced clinicians masked to each other's measurements. A 10-mm full-thickness punch biopsy was taken from the center of the burns and evaluated by a board-certified dermatopathologist masked to clinical assessments. One clinician and the dermatopathologist repeated the assessments 1 month apart. The outcome was percentage wound reepithelialization at 10 days. The criterion standard was the histological assessment. Intraobserver and interobserver agreements were calculated with Pearson's correlation coefficients. A coefficient less than .4 was considered poor. Sixteen burns were created on each of three animals. Six wounds were excluded because of the presence of a thick eschar covering the burn, making the gross determination of reepithelialization impossible. Intraobserver agreement for histological reepithelialization was 0.96 (P < .001). Intraobserver agreement for gross visual assessment of reepithelialization was 0.75 (P < .001). Interobserver agreement for gross visual assessment of reepithelialization was 0.60 (P < .001). The agreement between gross visual and histological assessment of burn reepithelialization was -0.25. Although there was a good interobserver agreement for gross visual assessments, there was a poor agreement between gross visual and histological assessments of burn reepithelialization. Care should be used when determining burn reepithelialization based on gross visual assessments alone.

Perspective of Oncology Patients During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Prospective Observational Study From India.

PURPOSE The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has imposed a unique challenge to oncology patients and their treatment. There is no study related to the patients' preference for systemic therapy during this pandemic. We have conducted a prospective study to analyze that aspect. METHODS All consecutive patients who visited during the lockdown period from April 1-10, 2020, for systemic chemotherapy were included in the study for a questionnaire-based survey to evaluate the willingness to continue chemotherapy during this pandemic and factors influencing the decisions. RESULTS A total of 302 patients were included (median age, 56 years; range, 21-77 years). Most common sites of cancer were breast (n = 114), lung (n = 44), ovary (n = 34), and colon (n = 20). Home address was within the city for 125 patients (42%), outside the city for 138 (46%), and outside the state for 37 (12%). Treatment was curative in 150 patients and palliative in 152. Educational status was primary and above for 231 patients and no formal schooling for 71. A total of 203 patients wanted to continue chemotherapy, 40 wanted to defer, and 56 wanted the physician to decide. Knowledge about COVID-19 strongly correlated with intent of treatment (P = .01), disease status (P = .02), knowledge about immunosuppression (P < .001), home location (P = .02), and education status (P = .003). The worry about catching SARS-CoV-2 was high in those with controlled disease (P = .06) and knowledge about immunosuppression (P = .02). Worry about disease progression was more with palliative intent (P < .001). CONCLUSION This study shows that oncology patients in our country are more worried about disease progression than the SARS-CoV-2 and wish to continue chemotherapy during this pandemic. The treatment guidelines in the COVID-19 scenario should incorporate patients' perspectives.

TransAnal Minimally Invasive Surgery (TAMIS) with SILS™ port versus Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery (TEM): a comparative experimental study.

BACKGROUND TransAnal Minimally Invasive Surgery (TAMIS) has been proposed as an alternative to Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery (TEM) for resection of benign polyps and early cancers of rectum. Since clinical application has begun in the absence of any experimental validation, we assessed its feasibility and efficacy ex vivo in a pilot study. METHODS In a dedicated trainer box for transanal procedures, 10 surgeons with no experience in transanal surgery were asked to perform a dissection/suture task using both TAMIS and TEM in randomly allocated order. Surgeons were asked to dissect two identically drawn lesions of ~3 cm in larger diameter. Precision of dissection was assessed using a quantitative photographic method, while the time needed for dissection and suturing was considered a measure of quantitative evaluation. Each participant expressed a subjective opinion regarding difficulty with dissection, difficulty with suturing, vision quality, and conflict between instruments on a scale from 1 to 5. RESULTS No difference was observed between the two techniques regarding the accuracy of dissection as the margin was interrupted along 4.1 % of the circumference in the TEM group compared with 2.48 % in the SILS group (P = 0.271). Dissection and suturing were significantly quicker in the TEM group [04:30 vs. 06:35 min (P = 0.049) and 14:34 versus 19:18 min (P = 0.003)]. In three cases in the SILS group, completing the suture was not considered possible, and the procedures were terminated by TEM. Subjective evaluation revealed a better appreciation of TEM in all proposed comparisons: dissection (2.6 vs. 3.5, P = 0.004), suturing difficulty (3.1 vs. 4.6, P < 0.001), quality of vision (2.3 vs. 2.8, P = 0.18), and instrument conflicts (3.1 vs. 4.0, P = 0.054). CONCLUSIONS In the ex vivo setting, both techniques were comparable for achieving a good dissection, although TAMIS failed to prove effective in suturing the rectal wall. Moreover, TEM was significantly quicker despite the small groups and was better appreciated by the surgeons.

A rapid systematic review of the efficacy of face masks and respirators against coronaviruses and other respiratory transmissible viruses for the community, healthcare workers and sick patients

BACKGROUND: The pandemic of COVID-19 is growing, and a shortage of masks and respirators has been reported globally. Policies of health organizations for healthcare workers are inconsistent, with a change in policy in the US for universal face mask use. The aim of this study was to review the evidence around the efficacy of masks and respirators for healthcare workers, sick patients and the general public. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized controlled clinical trials on use of respiratory protection by healthcare workers, sick patients and community members was conducted. Articles were searched on Medline and Embase using key search terms. RESULTS: A total of 19 randomised controlled trials were included in this study - 8 in community settings, 6 in healthcare settings and 5 as source control. Most of these randomised controlled trials used different interventions and outcome measures. In the community, masks appeared to be effective with and without hand hygiene, and both together are more protective. Randomised controlled trials in health care workers showed that respirators, if worn continually during a shift, were effective but not if worn intermittently. Medical masks were not effective, and cloth masks even less effective. When used by sick patients randomised controlled trials suggested protection of well contacts. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that community mask use by well people could be beneficial, particularly for COVID-19, where transmission may be pre-symptomatic. The studies of masks as source control also suggest a benefit, and may be important during the COVID-19 pandemic in universal community face mask use as well as in health care settings. Trials in healthcare workers support the use of respirators continuously during a shift. This may prevent health worker infections and deaths from COVID-19, as aerosolisation in the hospital setting has been documented.

Preventing Respiratory Viruses in the Neonatal ICU

BACKGROUND: Infants in the neonatal ICU can acquire respiratory viruses from ill healthcare personnel (HCP), visitors, or other infants. We describe the epidemiology of respiratory viruses and infection prevention and control interventions aimed to reduce acquisition and transmission of respiratory viruses in our NICU. METHODS: From May 2012 to December 2016, we tracked respiratory viruses detected by a multiplex reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR assay (FilmArray, Biofire, Inc.) in our 58-bed level IV NICU (~1,000 annual admissions). Testing was ordered by treating clinicians for symptomatic infants. Infants with positive RT-PCR tests generally remained on contact/ droplet precautions throughout their NICU stay. HCP were instructed not to work sick and report to Workforce Health and Safety if they became ill at work. Ill visitors were not permitted in the NICU, as enforced by written educational materials and signage, but formal screening was not performed. Starting in January 2015, asymptomatic infants exposed to RT-PCR-positive index cases were screened by RT-PCR, put on contact/ droplet precautions for the incubation period (IP) of the index case’s virus, and screened again at IP end. Starting in December 2015, visitors <12 years old were banned year-round. We assessed dyad transmission events (2 infants), clusters (3 infants), and outbreaks (>3 infants); all were defined as detecting geographically related cases within the relevant IP. We determined screened infants who had positive RT-PCR tests. RESULTS: During the 56 month observation period, 79 infants had 83 viruses detected (~1.8% of admissions). Rhino/ enterovirus (RV/EV) were most common (n = 59) and caused 1 outbreak of 7 infants, 4 clusters, and 5 dyad transmissions. Adenovirus caused 1 outbreak of 5 infants. Two dyad transmissions occurred for parainfluenza. Sporadic cases of RSV (n = 5), coronavirus (n = 5), and influenza (n = 2) occurred. Ill household contacts were identified for 10 infants. No HCPs were identified with respiratory illnesses. Since January 2015, 8 screened infants had positive RT-PCR tests. Since December 2015, only 1 transmission dyad (RV/EV) occurred. CONCLUSION: Preliminary data suggest that our interventions have reduced the burden of respiratory viruses in the NICU. DISCLOSURES: All authors: No reported disclosures.

Radiologic imaging of the transplanted bowel

BACKGROUND: The radiologic evaluation of the transplanted bowel is largely unknown and rather complex because it involves several techniques that depend on indications and times that have not been fully defined. METHODS: From December 2000 to November 2002 in the Section of Radiology I of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Modena, Italy), 11 patients with transplanted bowel were studied with different methods: traditional radiologic evaluation with contrast agent (all patients), evaluation of transit time with radiopaque markers (five patients), ultrasonographic (US) evaluation of the intestinal wall and Doppler US of the vascular axes (five patients), computed tomographic (CT) evaluation (all patients), and magnetic resonance (MR) evaluation of the bowel and the vascular axes (five patients). Traditional contrast examination enabled evaluation of the gastroesophageal transit and cardia functionality; anatomy and integrity of the anastomoses (proximal and distal); time of gastric emptying; morphology, tone, and kinesis of the transplanted small bowel loops and time of global transit. The study of transit with radiopaque markers was carried out in five patients to define the time of transit through the entire transplanted bowel, confirm recovery of intestinal motility, and identify possible abnormalities. The US examination was carried out in five patients to evaluate the morphology, thickness, and echo structural features of the intestinal loops. Color Doppler was performed to visualize the superior mesenteric artery and a wall arteriole of the sampled loop. CT examination was performed 2 to 4 weeks after surgery to evaluate the anatomy of the transplanted organs, arterial and venous anastomoses in case of complications identified with other methods or suspected, and periodically in the follow-up of patients who underwent transplantation due to Gardner syndrome. The protocol for MR evaluation of the bowel included coronal single-shot fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequences, axial and/or sagittal single-shot fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequences, coronal fast multiplanar spoiled gradient-echo (FMP- SPGR) sequences, coronal FMPSPGR sequences with and without administration of intravenous paramagnetic contrast agent, and axial or sagittal FMPSPGR fat-saturated sequences performed after dynamic gadolinium administration. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The study of transit with radiopaque markers was useful in patients with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction because it identified recovery and normalization of motility. Traditional contrast examination of the gastrointestinal tract continues to play an important role in transplanted patients because it is a simple examination that allows evaluation of the graft anatomy and recovery of motility of the residual native bowel and the transplanted loops. Moreover, it plays a crucial role in early detection of major postoperative complications such as intestinal obstruction, perforation, fistulas, and anastomotic complications (stenosis and dehiscence). CT examination is crucial for the detection of fluid collections, abscesses, and fistulas because it can serve as a guide of drainage and during follow-up of patients with Gardner syndrome can be used to investigate all possible sites in which desmoids might arise in addition to their relation to the graft. Because patients with transplanted bowel are generally rather a young population of reproductive age and because of technologic advances, MR may represent an effective method that does not use ionizing radiation and can therefore substitute for traditional radiologic evaluation. US represents a quick examination technique that is easily available and well tolerated by patients, and it has a role to play in the follow-up of transplanted patients and in the identification of major postoperative complications. However, its role in monitoring possible rejection remains to be defined with studies on wider and more representative samples.

Incidence, mechanisms, and outcomes of esophageal and gastric perforation during laparoscopic foregut surgery: a retrospective review of 1,223 foregut cases.

BACKGROUND Intraoperative perforation is a potentially major complication of laparoscopic (lap) foregut surgery. This study analyzed the incidence, mechanism, and outcomes of intraoperative perforations during these procedures in a large institutional experience. METHODS All patients who underwent lap foregut surgery including laparoscopic antireflux surgery (LARS), paraesophageal hernia (PEH) repair, Heller myotomy, and reoperative hiatal hernia (redo HH) repair at the authors' institution from August 2004 to September 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. Perforation events and postoperative outcomes were analyzed, and complications were graded by the modified Clavien system. All data are expressed as means ± standard deviations or as medians. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS In this study, the repairs for 1,223 patients were analyzed (381 LARS procedures, 379 PEH repairs, 313 Heller myotomies, 150 redo HH repairs). Overall, 51 patients (4.2 %) had 56 perforations resulting from LARS (n = 4, 1 %), PEH repair (n = 7, 1.8 %), Heller myotomy (n = 18, 5.8 %), and redo HH repair (n = 22, 14.6 %). Redo HH was significantly more likely to result in perforations than LARS or PEH repair (p < 0.001). The locations of the perforations were esophageal in 13 patients (23.6 %), gastric in 40 patients (72.7 %), and indeterminate in 2 patients (3.6 %). The most common mechanisms of perforations were suture placement for LARS (75 %) and traction for PEH repair (43 %) and for Heller myotomy during the myotomy (72 %). The most redo HH perforations resulted from dissection/wrap takedown (73 %) and traction (14 %). Perforations were recognized and repaired intraoperatively in 43 cases (84 %) and postoperatively in eight cases (16 %). Perforations discovered postoperatively were more likely to require reoperation (75 vs 2 %; p < 0.001), to require more gastrointestinal and radiologic interventions (50 vs 2 %; p = 0.004), and to have higher morbidity (88 vs 26 %; p = 0.004) than perforations recognized intraoperatively. CONCLUSIONS In a high-volume center, intraoperative perforations are the most frequent with reoperative HH repair. If perforations are recognized and repaired intraoperatively, they require minimal postoperative intervention. Unrecognized perforations usually require reoperation and result in significantly greater morbidity.

Update in Pediatric Emergency Medicine: Pediatric Resuscitation, Pediatric Sepsis, Interfacility Transport of the Pediatric Patient, Pain and sedation in the Emergency Department, Pediatric Trauma

This chapter summarizes the state-of-the-art approach to several critical aspects of pediatric emergency care. While the field of pediatric emergency medicine is much broader, we have chosen some key topics which are essential for every physician providing care to children. The resuscitation section highlights the challenges and the particularities of pediatric airway management as well as the correct technique for effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation, defibrillation and vascular access. The sepsis section stresses that the key to a successful outcome is early recognition; it outlines the clinical spectrum of sepsis, the systemic inflammatory response and the pathophysiology of septic shock, with emphasis on early clinical signs, airway management, volume resuscitation, vasoactive support and antibiotic therapy. In the last decade, attention to pediatric pain management has resulted in increasing awareness of assessment tools and pharmacologic as well as non-pharmacologic strategies for pain control and anxiolysis. The pain section updates these important aspects of pediatric care and includes management of procedural sedation. Although the general principles of trauma care in children are similar to those of adults, the trauma section highlights the key differences, with respect to anatomy and physiology, and how these impact on early recognition of hemorrhagic shock, susceptibility to specific injuries, indications for imaging (no pan-CTs!) and the more prevalent non-surgical management. Healthcare providers must also know how to safely transport a child who requires additional resources or an escalation in level of care. The regionalization of pediatric intensive care units and trauma services has made it imperative for pediatricians to understand the general principles of transport medicine outlined in this chapter. The overview of pediatric inter-facility transport discusses choice of transport team and modality, emphasizes patient stabilization prior to transport and outlines required medications and supplies.

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Therapeutic options against SARS-CoV-2

Importance Treatment options for Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are limited with no clarity on the efficacy and safety profiles. Objective To assess if the effect estimate of any intervention improves the outcomes and safety profile. Data sources PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central were searched from December 1, 2019 to May 11, 2020. Study selection Any prospective/retrospective clinical study on SARS-CoV-2 patients above 18 years of age with report on therapeutic interventions. Data synthesis and extraction Data was screened and extracted by two independent investigators. Main outcomes and measures The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes were rates of mechanical ventilation, viral clearance, adverse events, discharge, progression to severe disease, median time for clinical recovery and anti-viral clearance. Pooled rates and odds ratios (OR) were calculated. Results A total of 29 studies with 5207 participants were included in the analysis. The pooled all-cause in-hospital mortality rate was 12.8% (95%CI: 8.1%-17.4%) in intervention arm. There was no significant difference in mortality between both arms overall (OR: 1.36, 95% CI: 0.97-1.89). The mortality was significantly higher in the Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) group compared to control: (1.86, 95% CI: 1.38-2.50). The need for mechanical ventilation in patients with mild-moderate disease was 13.5% vs 9.8% in intervention and control groups, with no significant difference (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 0.60-4.15).The median duration for viral clearance in the intervention arm was 6.1 (IQR: 4.3-8.8) days and control arm was 9 (IQR: 4.5-14) days, with no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.37). There was no significant difference between pooled adverse event rates in intervention and control groups: 34% vs 29.5% (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 0.70-2.94), respectively. However, incidence of adverse events was significantly higher in HCQ sub-group (OR: 3.88, 95% CI: 1.60-9.45, I2 = 0%). There was no significant difference in other secondary outcomes. Conclusion and relevance The use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with increased mortality and adverse event rates. No other therapeutic intervention including Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Remdesivir or Tocilizumab seem to alter the natural course of the disease. There is a further need for well-designed randomized clinical trials.

Technical and clinical evaluation of a closed loop TIVA system with SEDLineTM spectral density monitoring: Multicentric prospective cohort study.

Introduction Closed loop total intravenous anesthesia is a technique in which the patient's hemodynamic and anesthetic depth variables are monitored, and based on this information, a computer controls the infusion rate of drugs to keep them within pre-established clinical parameters. Objective To describe the technical and clinical performance of a closed loop system for total intravenous anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil, using the SEDLineTM monitor. Design Multicentric prospective cohort study. Setting Surgery room. Patients ASA I-II undergoing elective surgery. Measurements The authors designed a closed loop system that implements a control algorithm based on anesthetic depth monitoring and the Patient State Index (PSITM) of the SEDLine monitor for propofol, and on hemodynamic variables for remifentanil. The measurement of clinical performance was made based on the percentage of PSITM maintenance time in the range 20-50. Precision analysis was evaluated by measuring median performance error (MDPE) can be defined as the median difference between actual and desired values, which refers to the degree of precision in which the controller is able to maintain the control variable within the objective set by the anesthesiologist; it represents the direction (over-prediction or under-prediction) of performance error (PE) rather than size of errors, which is represented by MDAPE, median absolute percentage error, Wobble index, which is used for measuring the intrasubject variability in performance error. Results Data were obtained from 93 patients in three healthcare centers. The percentage of PSITM maintenance time in the 20-50 range was 92% (80.7-97.0). MDPE was 10.7 (- 11.0-18.0), MDAPE 21.0 (14.2-26.8) and wobble 10.7 (7.0-16.9). No adverse surgical or anesthetic events were found. Conclusions The closed loop total intravenous anesthesia system with SEDLine developed by the authors was used without major complication and appear to be feasible its use in clinical performance.

Global research trends of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: a bibliometric analysis

BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a virus that causes severe viral pneumonia in humans, known to have a high mortality rate and a similarity in clinical symptoms with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in 2012 and after that, MERS-CoV exhibited outbreaks in several regions of the world. This study aimed to assess the characteristics of publications involving MERS-CoV at global level by using a bibliometric analysis. METHODS: Scopus database was searched on March 4, 2016 for MERS-CoV publications published between 2012 and 2015. It was performed on the same day in order to avoid the possible bias came from update on the database because the metrics are changing over time. All publication types were considered; however publications as errata were excluded. Analysis parameters include year of publication, publication type, patterns of international collaboration, research institutions, journals, impact factor, h-index, language, and times cited. RESULTS: A total of 883 MERS-CoV research publications were published across the world. The MERS-CoV-associated publications were originated from 92 countries/territories, indicating the international spread of MERS-CoV research. The USA was the largest contributor, with 319 articles published over 4 years, followed by KSA (113 articles). The total number of citations for these publications has already achieved 8,015, with an average of 9.01 citations per each publication. The h-index for MERS-CoV-associated publications was 48. The USA also have the highest h-index (32), followed by KSA (26) and UK (22). Netherland produced the greatest proportion of publications with international research collaboration (72.7 %) followed by the UK (71 %) and Germany (69.1 %) out of the total number of publications for each country. CONCLUSIONS: There is a rapid increase in research activities related to MERS-CoV from 2012 to 2015. This study demonstrates that the MERS-CoV related literature has grown to be more extensive and global over the past 4 years. The bulk of publications in the field of MERS-CoV research are published by high-income countries such as the USA. Furthermore, the USA, the UK and KSA may have higher quality of articles according to the value of h-index.

Influence of experimentally induced endogenous production of cortisol on the immune capacity in swine

Field studies have suggested that ‘stressors’, such as transportation and mixing, might interfere with the immune competence of pigs. Therefore, an experimental model was established to study the influence of elevated concentrations of circulating cortisol on the immune capacity in swine. Three experimental groups, with six pigs in each, were immunized twice, 4 weeks apart, with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antigen. Endogenous production of cortisol was induced by intramuscular injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) twice daily. One group received ACTH during the week before and after the second immunization, one group during the week after the second immunization only, while one group served as untreated controls. The treatment with ACTH induced high, but physiological, concentrations of cortisol in plasma. Simultaneously, the number of lymphocytes per milliliter blood decreased while the neutrophil number increased. The elevated concentrations of cortisol also coincided with reduced proliferation and interleukin-2 production by blood lymphocytes stimulated with the mitogens concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin in vitro, while the responses to pokeweed mitogen were less affected. The suppression of mitogen responses was more pronounced in cultures of whole blood than in cultures of purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Antibody production, induced by M. hyopneumoniae in cultures of purified PBMC was also inhibited by ACTH treatment. Both the rate of increase and the magnitude of the antibody production induced by the primary immunization were reduced. In contrast, no effects of ACTH treatment were recorded for the response to the second immunization or on the serum levels of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae. The ability of blood leukocytes to produce interferon-α (IFN-α) at exposure in vitro to fixed pseudorabies virus adsorbed to porcine kidney cells increased in all animals shortly after the second immunization with M. hyopneumoniae. The influence of cortisol on the IFN-α-producing capacity was dependent on whether the test was carried out in whole blood cultures or in cultures with purified PBMC. This finding further emphasizes that the relevance of in vitro assays for measuring in vivo phenomena must be carefully scrutinized.

Yupingfeng polysaccharides enhances growth performance in Qingyuan partridge chicken by up‐regulating the mRNA expression of SGLT1, GLUT2 and GLUT5

The ban on the use of antibiotic in feed encouraged nutritionists to using alternatives to maintain growth performance and intestinal function of broilers. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of Yupingfeng polysaccharides (YP) supplementation on growth performance and expression of SGLT1, GLUT2 and GLUT5 in Qingyuan partridge chicken. Experiment 1: a total of 540 chickens were randomly allocated to five groups with six replication. Dietary treatments were: (1) CON (control group), basal diet; (2) T1, CON + 0.5 g kg(−1) YP; (3) T2, CON + 1 g kg(−1) YP; (4) T3, CON + 2 g kg(−1) YP; (5) T4, CON + 4 g kg(−1) YP. Experiment 2, a total of 162 were randomly allocated to three groups with three replication. Dietary treatments were: (1) CON, basal diet; (2) T1, CON + 0.5 g kg(−1) YP; (3) T2, CON + 1 g kg(−1) YP. From days 1 to 14 and overall, chicken fed T1 diet had higher ADG. On day 42, there was increased villus height of jejunum in T1 group. On days 14 and 28, there was decreased villus height of duodenum and jejunum in T2 group. In duodenum, the expression of SGLT1 (days 21, 35 and 42), GLUT2 (days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42) and GLUT5 (days 7, 14, 21 and 28) was increased with YP supplementation. In jejunum, the expression of SGLT1 (days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35), GLUT2 (days 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42) and GLUT5 (days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42) was increased with YP supplementation. In ileum, the expression of SGLT1 (days 7, 21, 35 and 42), GLUT2 (days 7, 14, 21 and 42) and GLUT5 (days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42) was increased with YP supplementation. Dietary YP supplementation improves growth performance and expression of SGLT1, GLUT2 and GLUT5 in intestine.

Epidemiology of documented viral respiratory infections and acute otitis media in a cohort of children followed from two to twenty-four months of age.

BACKGROUND Viral upper respiratory infections (URIs) are considered major risk factors for acute otitis media (AOM) in young children. We studied the epidemiology and relative roles of different viruses in respiratory infections in a cohort of 329 Finnish children followed from 2 months to 2 years of age. METHODS A nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was collected whenever the child had signs and/or symptoms of URI and tested for the presence of common respiratory virus antigens or infectivity/nucleic acid (only rhinoviruses). Possible repeated detections of a given virus during a 30-day period were considered to represent a single designated virus-specific episode. AOM and URI episodes were defined in a similar way. RESULTS At least one virus was detected in 837 (41.7%) of the 2005 NPA specimens examined. Rates of URI and virus-specific episodes showed expected seasonal variation with major peak occurrences coinciding with or preceding those of AOM. The proportions of rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 3, influenza virus A and adenoviruses were 63.1, 14.7, 6.7, 6.7 and 6.2% of the total of 761 virus-specific episodes. Influenza virus B, PIV1 and PIV2 were each responsible for approximately 1% of the episodes. AOM was diagnosed in 870 URI cases (43.4%) and in 43.3% of cases associated with a virus-positive NPA. The latter figure was clearly higher (57.7%) for RS virus-positive specimens. CONCLUSIONS The seasonal coincidence of URI and AOM demonstrated the obvious role of URI in the pathogenesis of AOM. The occurrence of rhinoviruses and RS virus in URI was strikingly more common than that of any other virus tested. Although rhinoviruses were definitely the most frequently found viruses in NPA specimens, the association of RS virus with concurrent AOM was relatively higher than that of any other virus.

A primer of primate pathology: lesions and nonlesions.

Nonhuman primates are important laboratory animals for biomedical, pharmacology, and toxicology research. To effectively use primates as models, their gross and histologic anatomy, physiology and natural history, as well as common health problems and the source from which the primate is obtained, must be known and understood by pathologists involved in study design and/or interpretation. The first very important lesson in the "primer" is: there is no such thing as a generic monkey. Brand names (ie, species and subspecies) are important. Several taxonomic groups of primates are used in research including: prosimians, such as galagos and lemurs; New World monkeys, particularily marmosets; Old World monkeys, especially macaques and baboons; and the chimpanzee, an African ape. Differences between taxa are exemplified by the glucocorticoid resistance of New World monkeys compared to Old World monkeys, which results in the requirement for Vitamin D3 and their high circulating levels of steroids such as cortisone and progesterone. Differences in ovarian histology between Old and New World monkeys probably relate to steroid receptor biology as well. There are also variations in disease manifestations, even among closely related primate species such as rhesus and cynomolgus macaques (cynos). For example type D retrovirus infection is accompanied by lymphomas in cynos, but not rhesus. The second important lesson in this "primer" is: "not test article related" does not always mean "normal." Lymphoid nodules in bone marrow or salivary gland, a common background finding in macaques, often signal the presence of type D retrovirus. Other histologic changes and normal anatomic variations may be confusing to individuals not routinely examining primate tissues. The objective of this paper is to familiarize pathologists with the use of primates in research as well as lesions and nonlesions (normal anatomy or physiology) of primates that may influence study design and confound interpretation.

A longitudinal study of bovine coronavirus enteric and respiratory infections in dairy calves in two herds in Ohio

Abstract This prospective longitudinal study examined the epidemiology and disease syndrome associated with bovine coronavirus (BCV) infections in a cohort of 8 conventional calves from 0 to 120 days of age, in two dairy herds in Ohio. The periods of respiratory shedding of BCV were determined by direct immunofluorescent (DIF) staining of nasal epithelial cells and ELISA of nasal swab supernatant fluids. The periods of fecal shedding of BCV were determined by ELISA and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM). The isotype-specific antibody titers to BCV in serum (at selected intervals between 0 and 120 days of age) and the post-suckling (24 to 48 h after birth) total immunoglobulin levels were examined by ELISA and zinc sulfate turbidity tests, respectively. Of the 8 calves studied, 4 had evidence of BCV respiratory (by DIF or ELISA) or enteric infections (by IEM or ELISA) in association with diarrhea or rhinitis, even though 7 or 8 calves showed increases in one or more serum antibody isotypes to BCV and 6 of 8 calves showed BCV respiratory or enteric antigen shedding by ELISA. Serological antibody titer increases occurred in 3 calves before 30 days of age and in 4 calves after 30 days of age; two of the latter calves had a second rise in serum antibody titers to BCV after the initial rise. A serological antibody titer increase was not observed in one calf. This suggests that BCV infections may be very common in a closed herd and may occur in older calves, although many may be subclinical and some may be recurrent. There were no statistically significant correlations between total serum immunoglobulin levels or BCV antibody isotype titers in serum (24–48 h after birth) and clinical disease or infection by BCV; however, calves with low levels of IgA BCV antibodies in serum (24–48 h after birth) had a significantly greater average number of days with diarrhea than those calves having high levels of IgA BCV-specific antibodies in serum.

THE ERA OF CORONAVIRUS; KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE, PRACTICES, AND BARRIERS TO HAND HYGIENE AMONG MAKERERE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND KATANGA COMMUNITY RESIDENTS.

Background China reported the Novel Coronavirus at the end of the year 2019 which was, later on, declared a Pandemic by the WHO. Proper hand hygiene was identified as one of the simplest most cost effective Covid-19 control and prevention measures. It is therefore very important to understand the compliance of the community to hand hygiene. Method A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among the undergraduate students of Makerere University and residents of Katanga slum from 17th to 22nd of March, 2020. An interviewer guided questionnaire with questions on knowledge, attitude, practice, and barriers to hand hygiene was used in data collection. The collected data was analyzed using Microsoft office excel 2016 and STATA 15 software. A 95% confidence interval was used and statistical significance was P<0.05. Results Only 8.4% of the participants had good knowledge of hand hygiene. 11.7% of the university students had good knowledge compared to 0.9% of the Katanga residents. 29.0% of the participants had a good attitude while 50.1% had a moderate attitude to hand hygiene. University students were 6.3 times (OR: 6.3, 95%C1: (2.1 18.5), P=0.001) more likely to have good knowledge while Katanga residents were 3.6 times (OR: 3.6, 95%C1: (1.5 8.4), P=0.003) more likely to have good attitude to hand hygiene. Only 19.6% accomplished all the seven steps of handwashing. 38.4% of the participants still greeted by handshaking and 60.1% noted lack of soap as a barrier to hand hygiene and 62.9% reported having more than three barriers to hand hygiene. Participants that had been taught handwashing were more likely to have better hand hygiene knowledge and practice. Conclusion Despite a fair attitude, deficiency of knowledge coupled with many barriers such as Lack of soap hindered the Practice of proper hand hygiene. Public health involvement to promote hand hygiene must be promoted.

Safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of two Zika virus DNA vaccine candidates in healthy adults: randomised, open-label, phase 1 clinical trials

Summary Background The Zika virus epidemic and associated congenital infections have prompted rapid vaccine development. We assessed two new DNA vaccines expressing premembrane and envelope Zika virus structural proteins. Methods We did two phase 1, randomised, open-label trials involving healthy adult volunteers. The VRC 319 trial, done in three centres, assessed plasmid VRC5288 (Zika virus and Japanese encephalitis virus chimera), and the VRC 320, done in one centre, assessed plasmid VRC5283 (wild-type Zika virus). Eligible participants were aged 18–35 years in VRC19 and 18–50 years in VRC 320. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 by a computer-generated randomisation schedule prepared by the study statistician. All participants received intramuscular injection of 4 mg vaccine. In VRC 319 participants were assigned to receive vaccinations via needle and syringe at 0 and 8 weeks, 0 and 12 weeks, 0, 4, and 8 weeks, or 0, 4, and 20 weeks. In VRC 320 participants were assigned to receive vaccinations at 0, 4, and 8 weeks via single-dose needle and syringe injection in one deltoid or split-dose needle and syringe or needle-free injection with the Stratis device (Pharmajet, Golden, CO, USA) in each deltoid. Both trials followed up volunteers for 24 months for the primary endpoint of safety, assessed as local and systemic reactogenicity in the 7 days after each vaccination and all adverse events in the 28 days after each vaccination. The secondary endpoint in both trials was immunogenicity 4 weeks after last vaccination. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02840487 and NCT02996461. Findings VRC 319 enrolled 80 participants (20 in each group), and VRC 320 enrolled 45 participants (15 in each group). One participant in VRC 319 and two in VRC 320 withdrew after one dose of vaccine, but were included in the safety analyses. Both vaccines were safe and well tolerated. All local and systemic symptoms were mild to moderate. In both studies, pain and tenderness at the injection site was the most frequent local symptoms (37 [46%] of 80 participants in VRC 319 and 36 [80%] of 45 in VRC 320) and malaise and headache were the most frequent systemic symptoms (22 [27%] and 18 [22%], respectively, in VRC 319 and 17 [38%] and 15 [33%], respectively, in VRC 320). For VRC5283, 14 of 14 (100%) participants who received split-dose vaccinations by needle-free injection had detectable positive antibody responses, and the geometric mean titre of 304 was the highest across all groups in both trials. Interpretation VRC5283 was well tolerated and has advanced to phase 2 efficacy testing.

High-resolution computed tomography is useful for early diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus pneumonia in patients with normal chest radiographs.

OBJECTIVE We investigated the usefulness of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in early detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus pneumonia and analyzed HRCT findings associated with potentially more severe disease. METHODS All patients with suspected SARS and normal chest radiographs on admission within the study period were subjected to HRCT examination. The clinical, radiologic, and laboratory data of patients who were confirmed to have SARS-associated coronavirus infection by a positive nasopharyngeal aspirate, stool or urine reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or serological testing were prospectively followed up and analyzed. Characteristics of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those that were not were compared. RESULTS Among 47 suspected SARS patients with normal chest radiographs, 27 had SARS-associated coronavirus infection confirmed by RT-PCR and/or positive serological testing. Twenty-five of the 27 (93%) patients had HRCT changes compatible with atypical pneumonia, and all 25 patients developed SARS with progressive clinical deterioration. Ten (40%) had unifocal diseases, and 15 had multifocal diseases (60%). Ten (40%) patients had the diseases confined to 1 single lung in the first HRCT, and both lungs were involved at initial presentation in 15 (60%) patients. Concerning the overall extent of the disease at initial presentation, 3 (12%) patients had disease process in all lobes, and the disease was confined to 1 single lobe in 10 (40%) patients. The disease process was mainly peripheral in location (96%), and the lower lobes were more commonly involved (68% in the left lower lobe and 64% in the right lower lobe). Small parapneumonic effusions occurred in 1 (4%) patient. None of the patients with unifocal lesions or single-lung involvement were admitted to the ICU (P < 0.05) (in both comparisons). Subsequent follow-up of the 2 (7%) patients with normal HRCT on admission showed that they were having nonpneumonic SARS-associated coronavirus infection only and were eventually denotified from having SARS. CONCLUSIONS HRCT is useful for early diagnosis of SARS-associated coronavirus pneumonia in patients with normal chest radiographs. HRCT findings in these patients predict potentially severe disease.

Evaluation of 2 different treatment procedures after calving to improve harvesting of high-quantity and high-quality colostrum

ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to evaluate 2 different treatment procedures at the first milking after calving to increase colostrum quantity and to improve colostrum quality in dairy cows. We hypothesized that either exogenous treatment with oxytocin or the presence of the calf at first milking would lead to higher colostrum quantity and higher IgG concentration. The study was conducted from October to December 2017 on a commercial dairy farm in Germany. A total of 567 cows at the time of calving were enrolled, but for the final analyses only 521 animals were considered. The cows were randomly assigned on a daily basis into 1 of 3 groups: (1) control group (n = 177), (2) application of 20 IU of oxytocin i.m. (OXY; n = 163), and (3) presence of the calf (CA; n = 181) before and during milking. Cows in the control and oxytocin group had no contact with their calves after calving and were milked in a separate milking parlor. Cows in the oxytocin group were injected with 20 IU of oxytocin i.m. 3 min before manual stimulation. For cows in the third group, the calf was placed into a calf cart and located in front of the cow 3 min before manipulation of the cow. Colostrum quantity was determined by a digital hanging scale. The colostrum quality was assessed with digital Brix refractometry and ELISA. To evaluate the effect of 2 different treatment procedures, a generalized linear mixed model was constructed using SPSS (SPSS Inc., IBM, Ehningen, Germany). The mean (±SE) colostrum quantity was 4.17 ± 0.30 kg. The treatment procedures and the harvesting time after calving had no effect on colostrum quantity. Parity, calf birth weight, and calving time affected colostrum quantity. Cows in second parity had the lowest quantity of colostrum (3.74 ± 0.37 kg) compared with cows in parity 1 (4.75 ± 0.34 kg) and cows in parity 3 or greater (4.75 ± 0.38 kg). Cows calving during the night (2200 until 0600 h; 4.93 ± 0.37 kg) had the highest quantity of colostrum compared with cows calving in the morning (0600 until 1400 h; 4.17 ± 0.38 kg) or afternoon (1400 until 2200 h; 4.14 ± 0.34 kg). Regarding colostrum quality, 48% of the colostrum samples contained ≥50 mg of IgG/mL. The mean IgG concentration was 54.6 ± 2.80 mg of IgG/mL. Colostrum quality was affected by the treatment procedures, colostrum quantity, parity, calving time, harvesting time after calving, and the calving day during the week. Both treatment procedures (i.e., OXY with mean IgG concentration results of 57.0 mg of IgG/mL and CA with 56.0 mg of IgG/mL) resulted in higher IgG concentrations in colostrum compared with the control group (50.7 mg of IgG/mL). With increasing colostrum quantity, the colostrum quality decreased in primiparous and multiparous cows. A longer time lag between calving and milking negatively affected the colostrum quality. Concentration of IgG was higher for cows in parity 3 or greater (64.6 ± 2.59 mg of IgG/mL) compared with cows in parity 1 (48.5 ± 2.86 mg of IgG/mL) and cows in parity 2 (50.7 ± 2.89 mg of IgG/mL). Cows calving during the night had greater IgG concentrations (60.4 ± 2.92 mg of IgG/mL) compared with cows calving in the morning (51.9 ± 2.98 mg of IgG/mL) or afternoon (51.3 ± 2.71 mg of IgG/mL). Harvesting colostrum on quieter days, such as Sundays, resulted in higher IgG concentrations (61.4 ± 3.70 mg of IgG/mL). The assessment by Brix refractometry resulted in a mean result of 26.0 ± 0.20% Brix. Treatment procedures and the harvesting time after calving had no effect on colostrum quality. A negative association was observed between colostrum quantity and quality in primiparous and multiparous cows determined by Brix refractometry. Brix readings were greater for cows in parity 3 or higher (27.7 ± 0.26% Brix) compared with cows in parity 1 (25.3 ± 0.30% Brix) and cows in parity 2 (25.0 ± 0.32% Brix). In conclusion, the treatment procedure for the first milking is irrelevant to improve the quantity of colostrum. Both treatment procedures, however, increased IgG concentrations as determined by ELISA.

Effects of barbed suture during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy on postoperative tissue damage and longitudinal changes in lower urinary tract outcome.

OBJECTIVE To compare the postoperative tissue damage and longitudinal changes in functional and patient-reported outcomes after vesicourethral anastomosis with barbed suture and nonbarbed suture in robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP). MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective cohort study involving 88 consecutive patients who underwent RARP. These patients were categorized into the barbed suture group (n = 50) and the nonbarbed suture group (n = 38). Urethral and periurethral damages determined by magnetic resonance imaging at nine months after RARP were compared using generalized linear models. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QOL) index, uroflowmetry, and the 1-h pad test were measured at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after RARP. The findings were analyzed using mixed-effects models. Confounding was adjusted for using propensity score covariate adjustment. RESULTS The likelihood of having Grade 2/3 urethral and periurethral damages was greater in the barbed suture group than in the nonbarbed suture group (adjusted risk ratios: 2.98 and 3.85, respectively). IPSS, QOL index, and urinary leakage transiently increased at one month after RARP in both groups. QOL index was higher in the barbed suture group than in the nonbarbed suture group at 1, 9, and 12 months (P = 0.023, P = 0.025, and P = 0.011, respectively). The barbed suture group had significantly more cases of urinary incontinence than the nonbarbed suture group at 3 months (P = 0.041). Other outcomes were comparable between the two groups at all time points. CONCLUSIONS This cohort study showed that, after RARP, barbed sutures during VUA induced more severe tissue damage as determined by MRI and greater transient aggravation of QOL and continence function than nonbarbed sutures. The present findings suggest that using nonbarbed sutures during VUA may facilitate earlier acquisition of urinary QOL and urinary continence.

Pressure-controlled versus volume-controlled ventilation for acute respiratory failure due to acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

BACKGROUND Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) account for one-quarter of cases of acute respiratory failure in intensive care units (ICUs). A third to half of patients will die in the ICU, in hospital or during follow-up. Mechanical ventilation of people with ALI/ARDS allows time for the lungs to heal, but ventilation is invasive and can result in lung injury. It is uncertain whether ventilator-related injury would be reduced if pressure delivered by the ventilator with each breath is controlled, or whether the volume of air delivered by each breath is limited. OBJECTIVES To compare pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) versus volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) in adults with ALI/ARDS to determine whether PCV reduces in-hospital mortality and morbidity in intubated and ventilated adults. SEARCH METHODS In October 2014, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Isssue 9), MEDLINE (1950 to 1 October 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 1 October 2014), the Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1994 to 1 October 2014) and Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) at the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (1990 to 1 October 2014), as well as regional databases, clinical trials registries, conference proceedings and reference lists. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (irrespective of language or publication status) of adults with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure or acute on chronic respiratory failure and fulfilling the criteria for ALI/ARDS as defined by the American-European Consensus Conference who were admitted to an ICU for invasive mechanical ventilation, comparing pressure-controlled or pressure-controlled inverse-ratio ventilation, or an equivalent pressure-controlled mode (PCV), versus volume-controlled ventilation, or an equivalent volume-controlled mode (VCV). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened and selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We sought clarification from trial authors when needed. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. We assessed overall evidence quality using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. MAIN RESULTS We included three RCTs that randomly assigned a total of 1089 participants recruited from 43 ICUs in Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Spain and the USA. Risk of bias of the included studies was low. Only data for mortality and barotrauma could be combined in the meta-analysis. We downgraded the quality of evidence for the three mortality outcomes on the basis of serious imprecision around the effect estimates. For mortality in hospital, the RR with PCV compared with VCV was 0.83 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.02; three trials, 1089 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and for mortality in the ICU, the RR with PCV compared with VCV was 0.84 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.99; two trials, 1062 participants; moderate-quality evidence). One study provided no evidence of clear benefit with the ventilatory mode for mortality at 28 days (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.06; 983 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The difference in effect on barotrauma between PCV and VCV was uncertain as the result of imprecision and different co-interventions used in the studies (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.77; two trials, 1062 participants; low-quality evidence). Data from one trial with 983 participants for the mean duration of ventilation, and from another trial with 78 participants for the mean number of extrapulmonary organ failures that developed with PCV or VCV, were skewed. None of the trials reported on infection during ventilation or quality of life after discharge. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Currently available data from RCTs are insufficient to confirm or refute whether pressure-controlled or volume-controlled ventilation offers any advantage for people with acute respiratory failure due to acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. More studies including a larger number of people given PCV and VCV may provide reliable evidence on which more firm conclusions can be based.

White matter apoptosis is increased by delayed hypothermia and rewarming in a neonatal piglet model of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.

Therapeutic hypothermia is widely used to treat neonatal hypoxic ischemic (HI) brain injuries. However, potentially deleterious effects of delaying the induction of hypothermia and of rewarming on white matter injury remain unclear. We used a piglet model of HI to assess the effects of delayed hypothermia and rewarming on white matter apoptosis. Piglets underwent HI injury or sham surgery followed by normothermic or hypothermic recovery at 2h. Hypothermic groups were divided into those with no rewarming, slow rewarming at 0.5°C/h, or rapid rewarming at 4°C/h. Apoptotic cells in the subcortical white matter of the motor gyrus, corpus callosum, lateral olfactory tract, and internal capsule at 29h were identified morphologically and counted by hematoxylin & eosin staining. Cell death was verified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. White matter neurons were also counted, and apoptotic cells were immunophenotyped with the oligodendrocyte marker 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase). Hypothermia, slow rewarming, and rapid rewarming increased apoptosis in the subcortical white matter relative to normothermia (p<0.05). The number of white matter neurons was not lower in groups with more apoptosis after hypothermia or rapid rewarming, indicating that the apoptosis occurred among glial cells. Hypothermic piglets had more apoptosis in the lateral olfactory tract than those that were rewarmed (p<0.05). The promotion of apoptosis by hypothermia and rewarming in these regions was independent of HI. In the corpus callosum, HI piglets had more apoptosis than shams after normothermia, slow rewarming, and rapid rewarming (p<0.05). Many apoptotic cells were myelinating oligodendrocytes identified by CNPase positivity. Our results indicate that delaying the induction of hypothermia and rewarming are associated with white matter apoptosis in a piglet model of HI; in some regions these temperature effects are independent of HI. Vulnerable cells include myelinating oligodendrocytes. This study identifies a deleterious effect of therapeutic hypothermia in the developing brain.

Synthesis of hybrid hydrophobic composite air filtration membranes for antibacterial activity and chemical detoxification with high particulate filtration efficiency (PFE)

Abstract Hybrid hydrophobic composite PVDF–Ag–Al2O3 nanofibrous air filtration membranes are synthesized by the electrospinning method with different concentrations of Al2O3 and fixed concentration of Ag to study their antibacterial, particulate filtration efficiencies, and their detoxification ability. All the membranes were characterized for their physical and chemical properties before being tested. It was also found that at Al2O3 concentrations higher than 8%, nanofibers could not be formed by the pure blending and electrospinning technique. The antibacterial activity of the membranes proved that silver incorporation provided suitable disinfection with greater than 99.5% antibacterial efficiency for all membranes. The antibacterial efficiency of the membranes was maintained even as the concentration of Al2O3 was increased. The hydrolysis of paraoxon, a nerve agent simulant, for the prepared membranes was also studied. The removal of paraoxon was found to increase as the loaded concentration of Al2O3 in the membrane increased. The particulate filtration efficiency of the prepared membranes was tested using particles of diameter 0.36μm. Compared to the nascent PVDF nanofiber membranes with particle filtration efficiency of 94%, the Ag and Al2O3 loaded membranes all had a higher particle filtration efficiency. Interestingly, it was found that as the concentration of Al2O3 loaded in the membranes increased so did the particle filtration efficiency. Membrane characterization data revealed that as the concentration of the Al2O3 was increased, the average pore size of the membrane was reduced and the thickness of the filter mat increased. This would explain the higher retention of the particles by these filters. Correspondingly, the resistance of the filters also increased as more Al2O3 was loaded in the nanofiber membranes. The synthesized nanofibrous membranes have the potential to be used as 3 in 1 highly efficient air filters.

Hygienic hand antiseptics: Should they not have activity and label claims against viruses?

Abstract Enteric and respiratory viruses are among the most frequent causes of human infections, and hands play an important role in the spread of these and many other viral diseases. Regular and proper hand hygiene by caregivers and food handlers in particular is essential to decontaminate hands and potentially interrupt such spread. What would be considered a proper decontamination of hands? Handwashing with regular soap and water is often considered sufficient, but what of hygienic handwash and handrub antiseptic products? Are they more effective? The evidence suggests that some clearly are. Activity against bacteria may not reflect the ability of hygienic hand antiseptics to deal with viruses, especially those that are nonenveloped. In spite of the acknowledged importance of hands as vehicles for viruses, there is a lack of suitable regulatory mechanism for handwash or handrub products to make claims of efficacy against viruses. This is in contrast with the ability of general-purpose disinfectants to make antiviral claims, although transmission of viruses from surfaces other than those of reusable medical devices may play only a minor role in virus transmission. This review discusses the (1) recent information on the relative importance of viruses as human pathogens, particularly those causing enteric and respiratory infections; (2) the survival of relevant viruses on human hands in comparison with common gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria; (3) the potential of hands to transfer or receive such contamination on casual contact; (4) role of hands in the spread of viruses; (5) the potential of hygienic measures to eliminate viruses from contaminated hands; (6) relative merits of available protocols to assess the activity of hygienic hand antiseptics against viruses; and (7) factors considered crucial in any tests to assess the activity of hygienic hand antiseptics against viruses. In addition, this review proposes surrogate viruses in such testing and discusses issues for additional consideration by researchers, manufacturers, end-users, and regulators.

Coronavirus and paramyxovirus in bats from Northwest Italy

BACKGROUND: Bat-borne virus surveillance is necessary for determining inter-species transmission risks and is important due to the wide-range of bat species which may harbour potential pathogens. This study aimed to monitor coronaviruses (CoVs) and paramyxoviruses (PMVs) in bats roosting in northwest Italian regions. Our investigation was focused on CoVs and PMVs due to their proven ability to switch host and their zoonotic potential. Here we provide the phylogenetic characterization of the highly conserved polymerase gene fragments. RESULTS: Family-wide PCR screenings were used to test 302 bats belonging to 19 different bat species. Thirty-eight animals from 12 locations were confirmed as PCR positive, with an overall detection rate of 12.6% [95% CI: 9.3–16.8]. CoV RNA was found in 36 bats belonging to eight species, while PMV RNA in three Pipistrellus spp. Phylogenetic characterization have been obtained for 15 alpha- CoVs, 5 beta-CoVs and three PMVs; moreover one P. pipistrellus resulted co-infected with both CoV and PMV. A divergent alpha-CoV clade from Myotis nattereri SpA is also described. The compact cluster of beta-CoVs from R. ferrumequinum roosts expands the current viral sequence database, specifically for this species in Europe. To our knowledge this is the first report of CoVs in Plecotus auritus and M. oxygnathus, and of PMVs in P. kuhlii. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified alpha and beta-CoVs in new bat species and in previously unsurveyed Italian regions. To our knowledge this represents the first and unique report of PMVs in Italy. The 23 new bat genetic sequences presented will expand the current molecular bat-borne virus databases. Considering the amount of novel bat-borne PMVs associated with the emergence of zoonotic infections in animals and humans in the last years, the definition of viral diversity within European bat species is needed. Performing surveillance studies within a specific geographic area can provide awareness of viral burden where bats roost in close proximity to spillover hosts, and form the basis for the appropriate control measures against potential threats for public health and optimal management of bats and their habitats.

Triiodothyronine for the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial

OBJECTIVES: Tissue hypoxia is the main cause of multi-organ dysfunction in sepsis. However, effective pharmacological treatments to combat sepsis-induced tissue hypoxia are not available. Emerging experimental and clinical evidence reveals an evolutionary conserved action of thyroid hormone (TH) to adapt injured tissue to hypoxic conditions via its action on p38 MAPK, Akt signaling pathways. In addition, TH has favorable effects on the immune system and viral load in infected tissue. Non-Thyroid Illness Syndrome is common in sepsis, acute myocardial infarction and trauma and is associated with increased mortality. Thus, TH may be a novel treatment in the setting of critical illness due to viral infection in which hypoxia prevails. The present study aims to address the efficacy and safety of acute administration of triiodothyronine (T3) in critically ill COVID-19 infected patients requiring mechanical respiratory support or Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). TRIAL DESIGN: This study is a phase II, parallel, 2-arm (1:1 ratio), multi-centre, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Male and female patients aged over 18 years old who are diagnosed with pulmonary infection due to COVID-19, admitted to Intensive Care Unit and requiring mechanical ventilation or ECMO will be enrolled in this trial. Patients will be excluded in cases of pregnancy, severe systemic disease with life expectancy less than 6 months, participation in another trial of an investigational drug or device, corticosteroid and/or sympathomimetic use before initiation of treatment. All data will be collected in electronic CRF files. Participants will start to be recruited from the ICU center of “ATTIKO” University Hospital in Greece. We aim to include two more clinical sites in the trial one from Greece and one from Germany INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: T3 Solution for injection 10 μg/ml. The dose administered will be 0.8g/kg i.v. bolus and will be followed by an infusion of 0.113g. kg-1.h-1 i.v. for 48 hours (therapeutic dose). After the first 48h, a maintenance dose will be administered corresponding to 50% of the therapeutic dose (0.057g. kg-1.h-1 i.v.). Drug administration will stop after successful weaning or end of follow up (maximum 30 days). Comparator: Placebo with composition and dosage identical apart from the active substance. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome assessed in the present study will be the percentage of patients successfully weaned after 30 days of follow-up. Successful weaning is defined as no requirement for ventilatory support after extubation (mechanical support) or support from ECMO for 48 hours. RANDOMISATION: An allocation sequence to one of the groups will be prepared by the Sponsor of the study. A 1:1 treatment allocation will be adopted. An electronic CRF will be used incorporating IWRS in order to assure proper randomization and unblinding in emergency cases. The representative of the sponsor will get a copy of randomization codes. The information of the randomization codes will then be locked in the database until the time at which an interim analysis or final analysis is performed. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants, caregivers, and all investigators assessing the outcomes will be blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The sample size of 60 patients (that indicates 30 subjects for each group) will have 84% power to detect the estimated difference between the two study groups. The criterion for significance (alpha) has been set at 0.05 and the test is 2-tailed. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol number T3inj-02/ThySupport, version 03, May 11, 2020. The trial is not recruiting yet. The trial will start recruitment June 18(th) 2020. Estimated recruitment will finish June 18(th), 2021. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Triiodothyronine for the Treatment of Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 Infection (Thy-Support), ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04348513, date of trial registration: April 16, 2020, EudraCT Identifier: 2020-001623-13, date of trial registration: April 22, 2020 FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).

PRONOUNCE: randomized, open-label, phase III study of first-line pemetrexed + carboplatin followed by maintenance pemetrexed versus paclitaxel + carboplatin + bevacizumab followed by maintenance bevacizumab in patients ith advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer.

INTRODUCTION PRONOUNCE compared the efficacy and safety of pemetrexed+carboplatin followed by pemetrexed (Pem+Cb) with paclitaxel+carboplatin+bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab (Pac+Cb+Bev) in patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS Patients ≥18 years of age with stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC (American Joint Committee on Cancer v7.0), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0/1 were randomized (1:1) to four cycles of induction Pem+Cb (pemetrexed, 500 mg/m, carboplatin, area under the curve = 6) followed by Pem maintenance or Pac+Cb+Bev (paclitaxel, 200 mg/m, carboplatin, area under the curve = 6, and bevacizumab, 15 mg/kg) followed by Bev maintenance in the absence of progressive disease or discontinuation. The primary objective was progression-free survival (PFS) without grade 4 toxicity (G4PFS). Secondary end points were PFS, overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety. Resource utilization was also assessed. RESULTS Baseline characteristics of the patients randomized to Pem+Cb (N = 182) and Pac+Cb+Bev (N = 179) were well balanced between the arms. Median (months) G4PFS was 3.91 for Pem+Cb and 2.86 for Pac+Cb+Bev (hazard ratio = 0.85, 90% confidence interval, 0.7-1.04; p = 0.176); PFS, OS, ORR, or DCR did not differ significantly between the arms. Significantly more drug-related grade 3/4 anemia (18.7% versus 5.4%) and thrombocytopenia (24.0% versus 9.6%) were reported for Pem+Cb. Significantly more grade 3/4 neutropenia (48.8% versus 24.6%), grade 1/2 alopecia (28.3% versus 8.2%), and grade 1/2 sensory neuropathy were reported for Pac+Cb+Bev. Number of hospitalizations and overall length of stay did not differ significantly between the arms. CONCLUSIONS Pem+Cb did not produce significantly better G4PFS compared with Pac+Cb+Bev. Pem+Cb was not superior in PFS, OS, ORR, or DCR compared with Pac+Cb+Bev. Both regimens were well tolerated, although, toxicity profiles differed.

Stability of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in the environment and on common touch surfaces and the influence of climatic conditions: a review

Although the unprecedented efforts the world has been taking to control the spread of the human coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its causative etiology [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)], the number of confirmed cases has been increasing drastically. Therefore, there is an urgent need for devising more efficient preventive measures, to limit the spread of the infection until an effective treatment or vaccine is available. The preventive measures depend mainly on the understanding of the transmission routes of this virus, its environmental stability, and its persistence on common touch surfaces. Due to the very limited knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, we can speculate its stability in the light of previous studies conducted on other human and animal coronaviruses. In this review, we present the available data on the stability of coronaviruses (CoVs), including SARS-CoV-2, from previous reports to help understand its environmental survival. According to available data, possible airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested. SARS-CoV-2 and other human and animal CoVs have remarkably short persistence on copper, latex, and surfaces with low porosity as compared to other surfaces like stainless steel, plastics, glass, and highly porous fabrics. It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with diarrhea and that it is shed in the feces of COVID-19 patients. Some CoVs show persistence in human excrement, sewage, and waters for a few days. These findings suggest a possible risk of fecal-oral, foodborne, and waterborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in developing countries that often use sewage-polluted waters in irrigation and have poor water treatment systems. CoVs survive longer in the environment at lower temperatures and lower relative humidity. It has been suggested that large numbers of COVID-19 cases are associated with cold and dry climates in temperate regions of the world and that seasonality of the virus spread is suspected.

Liquid-injection for preperitoneal dissection of transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) inguinal [corrected] hernia repair.

BACKGROUND The creation of an adequate peritoneal flap during laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) inguinal hernia repair, while avoiding injuring surrounding structures can be technically challenging. Liquid infiltration of the preperitoneal space can help facilitate dissection and avoid inadvertent injuries. We describe a novel technique for TAPP inguinal hernia repair using liquid-injection for preperitoneal [corrected] dissection and report our initial experience. METHODS TAPP inguinal hernia repair using a liquid-injection technique during preperitoneal dissection was performed by a single surgical resident without prior TAPP repair experience from July 2013 to January 2014. After trocar placement, 60 mL of 0.3 % lidocaine with 1:300,000 dilution of epinephrine was injected percutaneously using a blunt needle under laparoscopic visualization into the preperitoneal space to assist with the dissection and parietalization of the vas deferens, spermatic vessels, and epigastric vessels. The initial peritoneal incision is performed at the lateral side of the inguinal canal, followed by blunt dissection of the preperitoneal space. RESULTS Eleven patients (median age: 69; 8 male) with a total of 12 inguinal hernias underwent a TAPP repair using a liquid-injection preperitoneal dissection technique. Ten patients had unilateral hernias (4 indirect, 6 direct), and one patient had bilateral direct hernias. The median operative time, median injection time, and median dissection time were 116, 3.5, and 42 min, respectively. Estimated blood loss was less than 10 mL for all cases. No intraoperative injuries, conversions to open repair, or 30-day postoperative complications occurred. There were no hernia recurrences after a median follow-up of 143 days. CONCLUSION Our preliminary experience suggests that liquid-injection to assist preperitoneal dissection during TAPP inguinal hernia repair appears to be safe and feasible. This novel method facilitates the dissection of spermatic cord structures, and can be used to minimize trauma to surrounding structures, especially when performed by trainees with limited operative experience.

Visualizing the invisible: class excursions to ignite children's enthusiasm for microbes

We have recently argued that, because microbes have pervasive - often vital - influences on our lives, and that therefore their roles must be taken into account in many of the decisions we face, society must become microbiology-literate, through the introduction of relevant microbiology topics in school curricula (Timmis et al. 2019. Environ Microbiol 21: 1513-1528). The current coronavirus pandemic is a stark example of why microbiology literacy is such a crucial enabler of informed policy decisions, particularly those involving preparedness of public-health systems for disease outbreaks and pandemics. However, a significant barrier to attaining widespread appreciation of microbial contributions to our well-being and that of the planet is the fact that microbes are seldom visible: most people are only peripherally aware of them, except when they fall ill with an infection. And it is disease, rather than all of the positive activities mediated by microbes, that colours public perception of 'germs' and endows them with their poor image. It is imperative to render microbes visible, to give them life and form for children (and adults), and to counter prevalent misconceptions, through exposure to imagination-capturing images of microbes and examples of their beneficial outputs, accompanied by a balanced narrative. This will engender automatic mental associations between everyday information inputs, as well as visual, olfactory and tactile experiences, on the one hand, and the responsible microbes/microbial communities, on the other hand. Such associations, in turn, will promote awareness of microbes and of the many positive and vital consequences of their actions, and facilitate and encourage incorporation of such consequences into relevant decision-making processes. While teaching microbiology topics in primary and secondary school is key to this objective, a strategic programme to expose children directly and personally to natural and managed microbial processes, and the results of their actions, through carefully planned class excursions to local venues, can be instrumental in bringing microbes to life for children and, collaterally, their families. In order to encourage the embedding of microbiology-centric class excursions in current curricula, we suggest and illustrate here some possibilities relating to the topics of food (a favourite pre-occupation of most children), agriculture (together with horticulture and aquaculture), health and medicine, the environment and biotechnology. And, although not all of the microbially relevant infrastructure will be within reach of schools, there is usually access to a market, local food store, wastewater treatment plant, farm, surface water body, etc., all of which can provide opportunities to explore microbiology in action. If children sometimes consider the present to be mundane, even boring, they are usually excited with both the past and the future so, where possible, visits to local museums (the past) and research institutions advancing knowledge frontiers (the future) are strongly recommended, as is a tapping into the natural enthusiasm of local researchers to leverage the educational value of excursions and virtual excursions. Children are also fascinated by the unknown, so, paradoxically, the invisibility of microbes makes them especially fascinating objects for visualization and exploration. In outlining some of the options for microbiology excursions, providing suggestions for discussion topics and considering their educational value, we strive to extend the vistas of current class excursions and to: (i) inspire teachers and school managers to incorporate more microbiology excursions into curricula; (ii) encourage microbiologists to support school excursions and generally get involved in bringing microbes to life for children; (iii) urge leaders of organizations (biopharma, food industries, universities, etc.) to give school outreach activities a more prominent place in their mission portfolios, and (iv) convey to policymakers the benefits of providing schools with funds, materials and flexibility for educational endeavours beyond the classroom.
