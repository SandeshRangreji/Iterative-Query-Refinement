DNA Vaccines against Protozoan Parasites: Advances and Challenges

Over the past 15 years, DNA vaccines have gone from a scientific curiosity to one of the most dynamic research field and may offer new alternatives for the control of parasitic diseases such as leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. We review here some of the advances and challenges for the development of DNA vaccines against these diseases. Many studies have validated the concept of using DNA vaccines for both protection and therapy against these protozoan parasites in a variety of mouse models. The challenge now is to translate what has been achieved in these models into veterinary or human vaccines of comparable efficacy. Also, genome-mining and new antigen discovery strategies may provide new tools for a more rational search of novel vaccine candidates.

Quantitative measurement of thyroglobulin mRNA in peripheral blood of patients after total thyroidectomy

Previous studies have reported the clinical usefulness of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of thyroglobulin (TG) mRNA in the peripheral blood of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. To evaluate this usefulness, we measured TG mRNA in the peripheral blood of patients diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma after total thyroidectomy by real-time quantitative RT-PCR using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA as an internal control. Surprisingly, we detected TG mRNA in all samples obtained after total thyroidectomy, including those from 4 medullary carcinomas. Further, there was no statistical difference in expression levels of TG mRNA in the patients with or without metastasis, and no significant correlation was found between serum TG concentrations and the expression levels of TG mRNA. These results give rise to a question regarding the clinical applications of not only RT-PCR detection but also quantitative measurement of TG mRNA in peripheral blood. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign http://www.bjcancer.com

Multiplex primer prediction software for divergent targets

We describe a Multiplex Primer Prediction (MPP) algorithm to build multiplex compatible primer sets to amplify all members of large, diverse and unalignable sets of target sequences. The MPP algorithm is scalable to larger target sets than other available software, and it does not require a multiple sequence alignment. We applied it to questions in viral detection, and demonstrated that there are no universally conserved priming sequences among viruses and that it could require an unfeasibly large number of primers (∼3700 18-mers or ∼2000 10-mers) to generate amplicons from all sequenced viruses. We then designed primer sets separately for each viral family, and for several diverse species such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) segments of influenza A virus, Norwalk virus, and HIV-1. We empirically demonstrated the application of the software with a multiplex set of 16 short (10 nt) primers designed to amplify the Poxviridae family to produce a specific amplicon from vaccinia virus.

Proteomics: Challenges, Techniques and Possibilities to Overcome Biological Sample Complexity

Proteomics is the large-scale study of the structure and function of proteins in complex biological sample. Such an approach has the potential value to understand the complex nature of the organism. Current proteomic tools allow large-scale, high-throughput analyses for the detection, identification, and functional investigation of proteome. Advances in protein fractionation and labeling techniques have improved protein identification to include the least abundant proteins. In addition, proteomics has been complemented by the analysis of posttranslational modifications and techniques for the quantitative comparison of different proteomes. However, the major limitation of proteomic investigations remains the complexity of biological structures and physiological processes, rendering the path of exploration paved with various difficulties and pitfalls. The quantity of data that is acquired with new techniques places new challenges on data processing and analysis. This article provides a brief overview of currently available proteomic techniques and their applications, followed by detailed description of advantages and technical challenges. Some solutions to circumvent technical difficulties are proposed.

Temporal Anomalies in Immunological Gene Expression in a Time Series of Wild Mice: Signature of an Epidemic?

Although the ecological importance of coinfection is increasingly recognized, analyses of microbial pathogen dynamics in wildlife usually focus on an ad hoc subset of the species present due to technological limitations on detection. Here we demonstrate the use of expression profiles for immunological genes (pattern recognition receptors, cytokines and transcription factors) as a means to identify, without preconception, the likelihood of important acute microbial infections in wildlife. Using a wood mouse population in the UK as a model we identified significant temporal clusters of individuals with extreme expression of immunological mediators across multiple loci, typical of an acute microbial infection. These clusters were circumstantially associated with demographic perturbation in the summertime wood mouse population. Animals in one cluster also had significantly higher individual macroparasite burdens than contemporaries with “normal” expression patterns. If the extreme transcriptional profiles observed are induced by an infectious agent then this implicates macroparasites as a possible player in mediating individual susceptibility or resilience to infection. The form of survey described here, combined with next generation nucleic acids sequencing methods for the broad detection of microbial infectious agents in individuals with anomalous immunological transcriptional profiles, could be a powerful tool for revealing unrecognized, ecologically important infectious agents circulating in wildlife populations.

Normal variation in thermal radiated temperature in cattle: implications for foot-and-mouth disease detection

BACKGROUND: Thermal imagers have been used in a number of disciplines to record animal surface temperatures and as a result detect temperature distributions and abnormalities requiring a particular course of action. Some work, with animals infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus, has suggested that the technique might be used to identify animals in the early stages of disease. In this study, images of 19 healthy cattle have been taken over an extended period to determine hoof and especially coronary band temperatures (a common site for the development of FMD lesions) and eye temperatures (as a surrogate for core body temperature) and to examine how these vary with time and ambient conditions. RESULTS: The results showed that under UK conditions an animal's hoof temperature varied from 10°C to 36°C and was primarily influenced by the ambient temperature and the animal's activity immediately prior to measurement. Eye temperatures were not affected by ambient temperature and are a useful indicator of core body temperature. CONCLUSIONS: Given the variation in temperature of the hooves of normal animals under various environmental conditions the use of a single threshold hoof temperature will be at best a modest predictive indicator of early FMD, even if ambient temperature is factored into the evaluation.

IL-15 Participates in the Respiratory Innate Immune Response to Influenza Virus Infection

Following influenza infection, natural killer (NK) cells function as interim effectors by suppressing viral replication until CD8 T cells are activated, proliferate, and are mobilized within the respiratory tract. Thus, NK cells are an important first line of defense against influenza virus. Here, in a murine model of influenza, we show that virally-induced IL-15 facilitates the trafficking of NK cells into the lung airways. Blocking IL-15 delays NK cell entry to the site of infection and results in a disregulated control of early viral replication. By the same principle, viral control by NK cells can be therapeutically enhanced via intranasal administration of exogenous IL-15 in the early days post influenza infection. In addition to controlling early viral replication, this IL-15-induced mobilization of NK cells to the lung airways has important downstream consequences on adaptive responses. Primarily, depletion of responding NK1.1+ NK cells is associated with reduced immigration of influenza-specific CD8 T cells to the site of infection. Together this work suggests that local deposits of IL-15 in the lung airways regulate the coordinated innate and adaptive immune responses to influenza infection and may represent an important point of immune intervention.

Human Anti-CCR4 Minibody Gene Transfer for the Treatment of Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma

BACKGROUND: Although several therapeutic options have become available for patients with Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL), no therapy has been curative. Recent studies have demonstrated that CTCL cells overexpress the CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, a xenograft model of CTCL was established and a recombinant adeno-associated viral serotype 8 (AAV8) vector expressing a humanized single-chain variable fragment (scFv)-Fc fusion (scFvFc or “minibody”) of anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) h1567 was evaluated for curative treatment. Human CCR4(+) tumor-bearing mice treated once with intravenous infusion of AAV8 virions encoding the h1567 (AAV8-h1567) minibody showed anti-tumor activity in vivo and increased survival. The AAV8-h1567 minibody notably increased the number of tumor-infiltrating Ly-6G(+) FcγRIIIa(CD16A)(+) murine neutrophils in the tumor xenografts over that of AAV8-control minibody treated mice. Furthermore, in CCR4(+) tumor-bearing mice co-treated with AAV8-h1567 minibody and infused with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), marked tumor infiltration of human CD16A(+) CD56(+) NK cells was observed. The h1567 minibody also induced in vitro ADCC activity through both mouse neutrophils and human NK cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, our data demonstrate that the in vivo anti-tumor activity of h1567 minibody is mediated, at least in part, through CD16A(+) immune effector cell ADCC mechanisms. These data further demonstrate the utility of the AAV-minibody gene transfer system in the rapid evaluation of candidate anti-tumor mAbs and the potency of h1567 as a potential novel therapy for CTCL.

Antiviral restriction factor transgenesis in the domestic cat

Studies of the domestic cat have contributed to many scientific advances, including the present understanding of the mammalian cerebral cortex. A practical capability for cat transgenesis is needed to realize the distinctive potential of research on this neurobehaviorally complex, accessible species for advancing human and feline health. For example, humans and cats are afflicted with pandemic AIDS lentiviruses that are susceptible to species-specific restriction factors. Here we introduced genes encoding such a factor, rhesus macaque TRIMCyp, and eGFP, into the cat germline. The method establishes gamete-targeted transgenesis for the first time in a carnivore. We observed uniformly transgenic outcomes, widespread expression, no mosaicism and no F1 silencing. TRIMCyp transgenic cat lymphocytes resisted feline immunodeficiency virus replication. This capability to experimentally manipulate the genome of an AIDS-susceptible species can be used to test the potential of restriction factors for HIV gene therapy and to build models of other infectious and noninfectious diseases. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nmeth.1703) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Significant cross reactive antibodies to influenza virus in adults and children during a period of marked antigenic drift

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the development of cross-reactive antibodies following natural exposure to pathogens. Such knowledge is critical in the development of new universal influenza vaccines. METHODS: To study the possibility of the presence of cross-reactive antibodies to influenza viruses which underwent a major antigenic drift between the years 1999 and 2007 sera from samples of 80 children and 400 adults were selected at random from the Israeli national serum bank. The sera was obtained in 2002 and in 2007, two time points that followed a major drift in the infectious H3N2 influenza virus strain (A/Panama/2007/99 to A/Wisconsin/67/2005). RESULTS: In the summer of 2002, 13% of the children had Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) antibody titers of at least 40 and these antibodies recognized both A/Panama/2007/99 and A/Wisconsin/67/2005, where the latter strain only began to circulate in Israel in 2006. In 2007, 29% of the children had HI antibody titers of at least 40 directed against both A/Wisconsin/67/2005 and A/Panama/2007/99, even though they had never been exposed to the latter virus. Anti-A/Panama/2007/99 antibodies were detected in 58% and 68% of the 2002 and 2007 adult samples, respectively, while 8% and 39% had antibodies against A/Wisconsin/67/2005, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of naturally occurring cross-reactive influenza virus antibodies in a significant percentage of children has important implications for the development of a universal influenza vaccine.

Clinical vaccine development

Vaccination is regarded as one of the biggest triumphs in the history of medicine. We are living in the most successful period of vaccine development. The accumulation of multidisciplinary knowledge and the investment of massive funding have enabled the development of vaccines against many infectious diseases as well as other diseases including malignant tumors. The paradigm of clinical vaccine evaluation and licensure has also been modernized based on scientific improvements and historical experience. However, there remain a number of hurdles to overcome. Continuous efforts are focused on increasing the efficacy and reducing the risks related to vaccine use. Cutting-edge knowledge about immunology and microbiology is being rapidly translated to vaccine development. Thus, physicians and others involved in the clinical development of vaccines should have sufficient understanding of the recent developmental trends in vaccination and the diseases of interest.

Common variants of NFE2L2 gene predisposes to acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with severe sepsis

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether common variants across the nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2) gene contribute to the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with severe sepsis. NFE2L2 is involved in the response to oxidative stress, and it has been shown to be associated with the development of ARDS in trauma patients. METHODS: We performed a case–control study of 321 patients fulfilling international criteria for severe sepsis and ARDS who were admitted to a Spanish network of post-surgical and critical care units, as well as 871 population-based controls. Six tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NFE2L2 were genotyped, and, after further imputation of additional 34 SNPs, association testing with ARDS susceptibility was conducted using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: After multiple testing adjustments, our analysis revealed 10 non-coding SNPs in tight linkage disequilibrium (0.75 ≤ r(2) ≤ 1) that were associated with ARDS susceptibility as a single association signal. One of those SNPs (rs672961) was previously associated with trauma-induced ARDS and modified the promoter activity of the NFE2L2 gene, showing an odds ratio of 1.93 per T allele (95 % confidence interval, 1.17–3.18; p = 0.0089). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the involvement of NFE2L2 gene variants in ARDS susceptibility and reinforce further exploration of the role of oxidant stress response as a risk factor for ARDS in critically ill patients.

Proteomic Analysis of the Vitreous following Experimental Retinal Detachment in Rabbits

Purpose. The pathogenesis of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) remains incompletely understood, with no clinically effective treatment for potentially severe complications such as photoreceptor cell death and proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Here we investigate the protein profile of the vitreous following experimental retinal detachment using a comparative proteomic based approach. Materials and Methods. Retinal detachment was created in the right eyes of six New Zealand red pigmented rabbits. Sham surgery was undertaken in five other rabbits that were used as controls. After seven days the eyes were enucleated and the vitreous was removed. The vitreous samples were evaluated with two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the differentially expressed proteins were identified with tandem mass spectrometry. Results. Ten protein spots were found to be at least twofold differentially expressed when comparing the vitreous samples of the sham and retinal detachment surgery groups. Protein spots that were upregulated in the vitreous following retinal detachment were identified as albumin fragments, and those downregulated were found to be peroxiredoxin 2, collagen-Iα1 fragment, and α-1-antiproteinase F. Conclusions. Proteomic investigation of the rabbit vitreous has identified a set of proteins that help further our understanding of the pathogenesis of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and its complications.

A Computer-Aided Detection System for Digital Chest Radiographs

Computer-aided detection systems aim at the automatic detection of diseases using different medical imaging modalities. In this paper, a novel approach to detecting normality/pathology in digital chest radiographs is proposed. The problem tackled is complicated since it is not focused on particular diseases but anything that differs from what is considered as normality. First, the areas of interest of the chest are found using template matching on the images. Then, a texture descriptor called local binary patterns (LBP) is computed for those areas. After that, LBP histograms are applied in a classifier algorithm, which produces the final normality/pathology decision. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposal, with success rates above 87% in the best cases. Moreover, our technique is able to locate the possible areas of pathology in nonnormal radiographs. Strengths and limitations of the proposed approach are described in the Conclusions.

Cross-protective efficacy of dendritic cells targeting conserved influenza virus antigen expressed by Lactobacillus plantarum

Avian influenza virus (AIV) can infect birds and mammals, including humans, and are thus a serious threat to public health. Vaccination is vital for controlling AIV circulation. In this study, we generated a recombinant lactobacillus expressing the NP-M1-DCpep of H9N2 avian influenza virus and evaluated the activation effect of NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep on dendritic cells (DCs) in a mouse model. The specific mucosal antibody responses and B and T cell responses in lymphoid tissues were also characterized. Importantly, we confirmed that specific CD8 T cells presented in vitro and antigen-specific cytotoxicity (activated the expression of CD107a) and in vivo antigen-specific cytotoxicity after vaccination. The adoptive transfer of NC8-pSIP409-NP-M1-DCpep-primed CD8(+) T cells into NOD-SCID mice resulted in effective protection against mouse-adapted AIV infection. In addition, we observed protection in immunized mice challenged with mouse-adapted H9N2 AIV and H1N1 influenza virus, as evidenced by reductions in the lung virus titers, improvements in lung pathology, and weight loss and complete survival. Our data are promising for the generation of effective, non-traditional influenza vaccines against AIVs.

Chemical property based sequence characterization of PpcA and its homolog proteins PpcB-E: A mathematical approach

Periplasmic c7 type cytochrome A (PpcA) protein is determined in Geobacter sulfurreducens along with its other four homologs (PpcB-E). From the crystal structure viewpoint the observation emerges that PpcA protein can bind with Deoxycholate (DXCA), while its other homologs do not. But it is yet to be established with certainty the reason behind this from primary protein sequence information. This study is primarily based on primary protein sequence analysis through the chemical basis of embedded amino acids. Firstly, we look for the chemical group specific score of amino acids. Along with this, we have developed a new methodology for the phylogenetic analysis based on chemical group dissimilarities of amino acids. This new methodology is applied to the cytochrome c7 family members and pinpoint how a particular sequence is differing with others. Secondly, we build a graph theoretic model on using amino acid sequences which is also applied to the cytochrome c7 family members and some unique characteristics and their domains are highlighted. Thirdly, we search for unique patterns as subsequences which are common among the group or specific individual member. In all the cases, we are able to show some distinct features of PpcA that emerges PpcA as an outstanding protein compared to its other homologs, resulting towards its binding with deoxycholate. Similarly, some notable features for the structurally dissimilar protein PpcD compared to the other homologs are also brought out. Further, the five members of cytochrome family being homolog proteins, they must have some common significant features which are also enumerated in this study.

LIVIVO – the Vertical Search Engine for Life Sciences

The explosive growth of literature and data in the life sciences challenges researchers to keep track of current advancements in their disciplines. Novel approaches in the life science like the One Health paradigm require integrated methodologies in order to link and connect heterogeneous information from databases and literature resources. Current publications in the life sciences are increasingly characterized by the employment of trans-disciplinary methodologies comprising molecular and cell biology, genetics, genomic, epigenomic, transcriptional and proteomic high throughput technologies with data from humans, plants, and animals. The literature search engine LIVIVO empowers retrieval functionality by incorporating various literature resources from medicine, health, environment, agriculture and nutrition. LIVIVO is developed in-house by ZB MED – Information Centre for Life Sciences. It provides a user-friendly and usability-tested search interface with a corpus of 55 Million citations derived from 50 databases. Standardized application programming interfaces are available for data export and high throughput retrieval. The search functions allow for semantic retrieval with filtering options based on life science entities. The service oriented architecture of LIVIVO uses four different implementation layers to deliver search services. A Knowledge Environment is developed by ZB MED to deal with the heterogeneity of data as an integrative approach to model, store, and link semantic concepts within literature resources and databases. Future work will focus on the exploitation of life science ontologies and on the employment of NLP technologies in order to improve query expansion, filters in faceted search, and concept based relevancy rankings in LIVIVO.

High Level Antibody Response to Pandemic Influenza H1N1/09 Virus Is Associated With Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Protein-3 rs12252-CC in Young Adults

Background: The C allele of the interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3) SNP rs12252, a common allele in South East Asia and China, is strongly associated with severe influenza infection. However, despite the high occurrence of rs12252-CC genotype in Chinese population (~25%), severe influenza infection is rare. The aim of study is to determine whether rs12252-CC individuals have pre-existing antibody responses to previous seasonal influenza infections. Cohort and Method: A total 99 young healthy volunteers (18–20 years) were recruited and received an influenza seasonal Vaccination [A/Switzerland/9715293/2013(H3N2), A/California/7/2009 (pdm09H1N1) and B/Jeep/3073/2013-like virus (Flu-B)]. Plasma and gDNA was isolated from each volunteer before, and 14, 28, 180, 360, and 540 days after vaccination. Additionally, 68 elderlies (>65 years) were also recruited as a control group to compare the levels of antibodies at baseline between the young adults and the elderly. For each sample IFITM3 rs12252 genotype was determined and antibody levels in response to pdmH1N1, H3N2 and Influenza B infection were measured for each time point. Results: We found a significantly higher level of pre-existing antibodies to pandemic influenza H1N1/09 virus (pdm09H1N1) but not to H3N2 or FluB in CC donors in comparison with CT/TT donors prior to vaccination. No impact of IFITM3 genotype in boosting influenza specific antibodies in young adults within 1 year after receiving seasonal influenza vaccination was observed. In addition, there was no difference in pdm09H1N1 specific antibody levels observed in the elderly cohort between volunteers carrying different IFITM3 genotypes. Higher levels of antibodies to pdmH1N1 were observed in elderly CC carriers when compared to the young CC carriers, but this trend was not replicated in TT carriers. Conclusion: IFITM3-rs12252 CC carriers exhibit a high level of pre-existing immunity to pdm09H1N1 compared to TT carriers in the young cohort. This suggests that compensatory mechanisms exist which might contribute to viral control in patients carrying the rs12252-CC genotype who do not become sick after flu infection. However, such a potential compensatory effect appears to be lost overtime, as evidenced in the elderly cohort. If this compensatory mechanism is lost, it may make the CC carrying elderly more susceptible to severe influenza infection.

Influenza A Virus Cell Entry, Replication, Virion Assembly and Movement

Influenza viruses replicate within the nucleus of the host cell. This uncommon RNA virus trait provides influenza with the advantage of access to the nuclear machinery during replication. However, it also increases the complexity of the intracellular trafficking that is required for the viral components to establish a productive infection. The segmentation of the influenza genome makes these additional trafficking requirements especially challenging, as each viral RNA (vRNA) gene segment must navigate the network of cellular membrane barriers during the processes of entry and assembly. To accomplish this goal, influenza A viruses (IAVs) utilize a combination of viral and cellular mechanisms to coordinate the transport of their proteins and the eight vRNA gene segments in and out of the cell. The aim of this review is to present the current mechanistic understanding for how IAVs facilitate cell entry, replication, virion assembly, and intercellular movement, in an effort to highlight some of the unanswered questions regarding the coordination of the IAV infection process.

Projections of Ebola outbreak size and duration with and without vaccine use in Équateur, Democratic Republic of Congo, as of May 27, 2018

As of May 27, 2018, 6 suspected, 13 probable and 35 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) had been reported in Équateur Province, Democratic Republic of Congo. We used reported case counts and time series from prior outbreaks to estimate the total outbreak size and duration with and without vaccine use. We modeled Ebola virus transmission using a stochastic branching process model that included reproduction numbers from past Ebola outbreaks and a particle filtering method to generate a probabilistic projection of the outbreak size and duration conditioned on its reported trajectory to date; modeled using high (62%), low (44%), and zero (0%) estimates of vaccination coverage (after deployment). Additionally, we used the time series for 18 prior Ebola outbreaks from 1976 to 2016 to parameterize the Thiel-Sen regression model predicting the outbreak size from the number of observed cases from April 4 to May 27. We used these techniques on probable and confirmed case counts with and without inclusion of suspected cases. Probabilistic projections were scored against the actual outbreak size of 54 EVD cases, using a log-likelihood score. With the stochastic model, using high, low, and zero estimates of vaccination coverage, the median outbreak sizes for probable and confirmed cases were 82 cases (95% prediction interval [PI]: 55, 156), 104 cases (95% PI: 58, 271), and 213 cases (95% PI: 64, 1450), respectively. With the Thiel-Sen regression model, the median outbreak size was estimated to be 65.0 probable and confirmed cases (95% PI: 48.8, 119.7). Among our three mathematical models, the stochastic model with suspected cases and high vaccine coverage predicted total outbreak sizes closest to the true outcome. Relatively simple mathematical models updated in real time may inform outbreak response teams with projections of total outbreak size and duration.

Relevance of Autophagy Induction by Gastrointestinal Hormones: Focus on the Incretin-Based Drug Target and Glucagon

The biology of autophagy in health and disease conditions has been intensively analyzed for decades. Several potential interventions can induce autophagy in preclinical research; however, none of these interventions are ready for translation to clinical practice yet. The topic of the current review is the molecular regulation of autophagy by glucagon, glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and the GLP-1-degrading enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). Glucagon is a well-known polypeptide that induces autophagy. In contrast, GLP-1 has been shown to inhibit glucagon secretion; GLP-1 also has been related to the induction of autophagy. DPP-4 inhibitors can induce autophagy in a GLP-1–dependent manner, but other diverse effects could be relevant. Here, we analyze the distinct molecular regulation of autophagy by glucagon, GLP-1, and DPP-4 inhibitors. Additionally, the potential contribution to autophagy by glucagon and GLP-1 after bariatric surgery is discussed.

Integrative QTL analysis of gene expression and chromatin accessibility identifies multi-tissue patterns of genetic regulation

Gene transcription profiles across tissues are largely defined by the activity of regulatory elements, most of which correspond to regions of accessible chromatin. Regulatory element activity is in turn modulated by genetic variation, resulting in variable transcription rates across individuals. The interplay of these factors, however, is poorly understood. Here we characterize expression and chromatin state dynamics across three tissues—liver, lung, and kidney—in 47 strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population, examining the regulation of these dynamics by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and chromatin QTL (cQTL). QTL whose allelic effects were consistent across tissues were detected for 1,101 genes and 133 chromatin regions. Also detected were eQTL and cQTL whose allelic effects differed across tissues, including local-eQTL for Pik3c2g detected in all three tissues but with distinct allelic effects. Leveraging overlapping measurements of gene expression and chromatin accessibility on the same mice from multiple tissues, we used mediation analysis to identify chromatin and gene expression intermediates of eQTL effects. Based on QTL and mediation analyses over multiple tissues, we propose a causal model for the distal genetic regulation of Akr1e1, a gene involved in glycogen metabolism, through the zinc finger transcription factor Zfp985 and chromatin intermediates. This analysis demonstrates the complexity of transcriptional and chromatin dynamics and their regulation over multiple tissues, as well as the value of the CC and related genetic resource populations for identifying specific regulatory mechanisms within cells and tissues.

The cytotoxin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Cytotoxicity requires proteolytic activation

The primary structure of a cytotoxin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was determined by sequencing of the structural gene. The cytotoxin (31,700 Mr) lacks an N-terminal signal sequence for bacterial secretion but contains a pentapeptide consensus sequence commonly found in prokaryotic proteins which function in a TonB-dependent manner. The cytotoxin gene has a [G+C]-content of 53.8% which is considerably lower than generally observed for genes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The cytotoxin gene was exclusively detected in strain 158 but not in three other clinical isolates, as determined by Southern and Northern hybridization. The latter technique revealed that the toxin is translated from monocistronic mRNA. The promoter of the cytotoxin is inactive in Escherichia coli. Upon site-directed modification of the 5′-noncoding region by the polymerase chain reaction the gene was expressed under control of the trcpromoter. The gene product obtained in Escherichia coli was nontoxic. Toxicity was induced by subsequent treatment with trypsin. [(35)S]methionine-labeled cytotoxin with high specific radioactivity was obtained by in vitro transcription/translation. Like [(125)I] labeled material from Pseudomonas aeruginosa this polypeptide bound to membrane preparations from Ehrlich ascites cells, as evidenced by sedimentation through a sucrose gradient at neutral pH.

Predictive evidence for a porin-type β-barrel fold in CHIP28 and other members of the MIP family. A restricted-pore model common to water channels and facilitators

Water channels are the subject of much current attention, as they may be central for cell functions in a host of tissues. We have analyzed the possible fold of facilitators and water channels of the MIP family based on structural predictions, on findings about the topology of CHIP28, and on the biophysical characteristics of water channels. We developed predictions for the following proteins: MIP26, NOD26, GLP, BIB, γ-TIP, FA-CHIP, CHIP28k, WCH-CD1, and CHIP28. We utilized Kyte Doolittle hydrophobicity, Eisenberg's amphiphilicity, Chou-Fasman-Prevelige propensities, and our own Union algorithm. We found that hydrophobic amphiphilic segments likely to be transmembrane were consistently shorter than required for α-helical segments, but of the correct length for β-strands. Turn propensity was high at frequent intervals, consistent with transmembrane β-strands. We propose that these proteins fold as porin-like 16-stranded antiparallel β-barrels. In water channels, from the size of molecules excluded, an extramembrane loop(s) would enter the pore and restrict it to a bottleneck with a width 4 Å ⩽w ⩽5 Å. A similar but more mobile loop(s) would act as gate and binding site for the facilitators of the MIP family.

Molecular surveillance for avian influenza A virus in king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus)

An investigation of the presence of influenza A virus has been conducted in king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) at the Possession Island in the Crozet Archipelago, Antarctica, using a rapid molecular diagnostic method based on real-time polymerase chain reaction. No evidence of outbreak or positive viral infection of influenza A virus was found in this study. We however recommend the implementation of long-term surveillance in seabird populations of polar ecosystems to detect the potential introduction of exotic strains and potential existence of a local epidemiological cycle for avian influenza viruses.

An insight into the potentially old-wonder molecule—quercetin: the perspectives in foresee

Use of phyto-medicine and digitalization of phyto-compounds has been fallen enthralling field of science in recent years. Quercetin, a flavonoid with brilliant citron yellow pigment, is typically found in fruits and leafy vegetables in reasonable amount. Quercetin’s potentials as an antioxidant, immune-modulator, antiinflammatory, anti-cancer, and others have been the subject of interest in this review. Although, profiling the insights in to the molecular characterization of quercetin with various targets provided the loop-holes in understanding the knowledge for the aforementioned mechanisms, still necessitates research globally to unearth it completely. Thus, the available science on the synthesis and significant role played by the old molecule - quercetin which does wonders even now have been vividly explained in the present review to benefit the scientific community.

Monolayer culture of rat parotid acinar cells without basement membrane substrates

Acinar cells have been difficult to maintain in primary or secondary cultures over extended periods of time. The most successful monolayer culture system reported to date requires basement membrane substrates. We report here a technique for culture of rat parotid acinar cells which does not rely upon basement membrane supports for maintenance and growth. The procedure involves gland excision, treatment to chelate metal ions, enzymatic digestion with collagenases and hyaluronidase, removal of fat and red blood cells by gravimetric separation, and nylon mesh filtration to yield a homogeneous suspension of small aggregates and single cells. The cells were examined for: a) morphology, identity, and growth; b) macromolecular synthesis; and c) secretory output. They were healthy, peroxidase positive, and growing for up to 10 d. Protein synthesis increased from the point of cell layer formation at 3 to 4 d, through 10 d, while DNA synthesis decreased. As in other studies, amylase secretion fell sharply between 2 and 4 d in culture and remained low. Although previous studies indicated that the initial isolation protocol left these acinar cells unable to thrive in monolayer culture except in the presence of basement membrane substrates, the modified technique reported herein allows these cells to attach, spread, and grow on a wide variety of commerically available plasticware. this method lends itself readily to long-term analysis of rat parotid acinar cell metabolism without the complications of dedifferentiation, cell loss through culture manipulation common in suspension cultures, or complex interactions between bioactive supports and cell surfaces.

Immune predictors of oral poliovirus vaccine immunogenicity among infants in South India

Identification of the causes of poor oral vaccine immunogenicity in low-income countries might lead to more effective vaccines. We measured mucosal and systemic immune parameters at the time of vaccination with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in 292 Indian infants aged 6–11 months, including plasma cytokines, leukocyte counts, fecal biomarkers of environmental enteropathy and peripheral blood T-cell phenotype, focused on gut-homing regulatory CD4+ populations. We did not find a distinct immune phenotype associated with OPV immunogenicity, although viral pathogens were more prevalent in stool at the time of immunization among infants who failed to seroconvert (63.9% vs. 45.6%, p = 0.002). Using a machine-learning approach, we could predict seroconversion a priori using immune parameters and infection status with a median 58% accuracy (cross-validation IQR: 50–69%) compared with 50% expected by chance. Better identification of immune predictors of OPV immunogenicity is likely to require sampling of mucosal tissue and improved oral poliovirus infection models.

Pneumonia in patients with novel influenza A (H1N1) virus in Southeastern Turkey

The objective of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and the radiological and laboratory findings of the hospitalised patients who had novel, laboratory-confirmed, swine-origin influenza A virus (S-OIV) infection with pneumonia. Between October and December 2009, 56 patients hospitalised for pneumonia who were tested for S-OIV infection were retrospectively evaluated. Thirty-three patients had positive S-OIV infections. In addition, 23 of the 56 patients who had negative test results for S-OIV infection were compared with the positive group. The mortality rate amongst the patients with S-OIV infection was 24.2%. Of the 33 patients, 42.4% had at least one underlying medical condition and 4 (12%) patients were pregnant or postpartum. Fourteen patients (42.4%) with S-OIV infection were followed up in an intensive care unit. The most common symptom was dyspnea. The mean peak body temperature during hospital stay (39.42 ± 0.70) was higher in this group than in the negative group (38.51 ± 1.05) (p = 0.001). Thrombocytopenia, increased creatine kinase and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels were statistically significant. Bilateral infiltration was more common in the patients with S-OIV infection. Although some laboratory, radiological and clinical data show a significant difference between the patients with S-OIV pneumonia and the negative group, each patient presenting with signs of pneumonia during pandemia should be tested for Influenza A.

Gene therapy in surgery: Part II: Application to septic shock and to organ transplantation

Background: With the increasing body of knowledge in molecular biology, gene transfer respectively gene therapy becomes more and more a valid therapeutic option. Methods: This is a critical review of gene therapy protocols for treatment of different types of cancer. Furthermore, the pathophysiological mechanism, therapeutically strategies as well as experimental approaches toward gene transfer in septic shock and organ transplantation are critically elucidated. Results: Gene transfer as a therapeutic option was first successfully applied in children with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in 1990. The majority of gene marking or gene therapy protocols approved for human clinical trials to date are related to the treatment of cancer. Besides viral vectors for brain tumors, non-viral vectors, liposomes particularly, with almost no side effects are increasingly used. Conclusions: Different approaches of gene transfer in cancer patients are under investigation. Experimental data of septic shock treatment and rejection therapy of the allograft in organ recipients with gene transfer are encouraging for future applications in clinical trials.

Drug Antioxidant Effects: A Basis for Drug Selection?

A free radical is any species capable of independent existence that contains one or more unpaired electrons. Free radical reactions have been implicated in the pathology of more than 50 human diseases. Radicals and other reactive oxygen species are formed constantly in the human body, both by deliberate synthesis (e.g. by activated phagocytes) and by chemical side- reactions. They are removed by enzymic and nonenzymic antioxidant defence systems. Oxidative stress, occurring when antioxidant defences are inadequate, can damage lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and DNA. A few clinical conditions are caused by oxidative stress, but more often the stress results from the disease. Sometimes it then makes a significant contribution to the disease pathology, and sometimes it does not. Several antioxidants are available for therapeutic use. They include molecules naturally present in the body [superoxide dismutase (SOD), α-tocopherol, glutathione and its precursors, ascorbic acid, adenosine, lactoferrin and carotenoids] as well as synthetic antioxidants [such as thiols, ebselen (PZ51), xanthine oxidase inhibitors, inhibitors of phagocyte function, iron ion chelators and probucol]. The therapeutic efficacy of SOD, α- tocopherol and ascorbic acid in the treatment of human disease is generally unimpressive to date although dietary deficiencies of the last two molecules should certainly be avoided. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors may be of limited relevance as antioxidants for human use. Exciting preliminary results with probucol (antiatherosclerosis), ebselen (anti-inflammatory), and iron ion chelators (in thalassaemia, leukaemia, malaria, stroke, traumatic brain injury and haemorrhagic shock) need to be confirmed by controlled clinical trials. Clinical testing of N-acetylcysteine in HIV-1-positive subjects may also be merited. A few drugs already in clinical use may have some antioxidant properties, but this ability is not widespread and drug- derived radicals may occasionally cause significant damage.

Hand-assisted Laparoscopic Splenectomy and Devascularization of the Upper Stomach in the Management of Gastric Varices

BACKGROUND: Bleeding from esophagogastric varices is the major cause of death in patients with portal hypertension. Although esophageal varices can be treated with endoscopic procedures, the treatment for gastric varices is still controversial. The aim of this study was to describe a surgical technique and our preliminary results of hand-assisted laparoscopic Hassab’s procedure. METHODS: Between February 2002 and May 2005, we performed 7 cases of gastric varices with this type of operation. The patients included 4 men and 3 women who ranged in age from 23 to 74 years (underlying liver disease: 5 case of liver cirrhosis, 1 case of polycystic disease, 1 case of extrahepatic portal vein obstruction). After splenctomy was performed, we devascularized the vessels of the upper stomach and the esophagus 5 cm away from the esophago-cardia junction. RESULTS: The operative time ranged from 132 to 290 minutes. Intraoperative blood loss was estimated to be from 50 ml to 475 ml. The weight of removed spleen ranged from 110 g to 800 g. During the follow-up period, all gastric varices disappeared and no bleeding from varicose veins was observed. All patients had hypersplenism with thrombocytopenia before surgery (mean: 11.1 ± 7.4 × 10(4)/ml), which was improved postoperatively (mean: 30.8 ±19.0 × 10(4)/ml). This data were statistically significant (P = 0.033). One patient died of aspiration pneumonia related to postoperative pyloric stricture. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is no agreement concerning the best treatment of gastric varices, the hand-assisted laparoscopic Hassab’s operation is a safe, moderately invasive method, and its outcome appears to be equal to that of other open procedures.

Etiology of Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Hospitalized School-Age Children: Evidence for High Prevalence of Viral Infections

Background. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in young children is most commonly associated with viral infections; however, the role of viruses in CAP of school-age children is still inconclusive. Methods. Seventy-five school-age children hospitalized with CAP were prospectively evaluated for the presence of viral and bacterial pathogens. Nasopharyngeal washes were examined by polymerase chain reaction for viruses and atypical bacteria. Antibody assays to detect bacterial pathogens in acute-phase and convalescent-phase serum samples were also performed. Results. A viral infection was identified in 65% of cases. Rhinovirus RNA was detected in 45% of patients; infection with another virus occurred in 31%. The most common bacterial pathogen was Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which was diagnosed in 35% of cases. Chlamydia pneumoniae DNA was not detected in any patient; results of serological tests were positive in only 2 patients (3%). Mixed infections were documented in 35% of patients, and the majority were a viral-bacterial combination. Conclusions. The high prevalence of viral and mixed viral-bacterial infections supports the notion that the presence of a virus, acting either as a direct or an indirect pathogen, may be the rule rather than the exception in the development of CAP in school-age children requiring hospitalization.

Highly conserved M2e and hemagglutinin epitope-based recombinant proteins induce protection against influenza virus infection

Highly pathogenic influenza viruses continue to cause serious threat to public health due to their pandemic potential, calling for an urgent need to develop effective, safe, convenient, and universal vaccines against influenza virus infection. In this study, we constructed two recombinant protein vaccines, 2H5M2e-2H7M2e-H5FP-H7FP (hereinafter M2e-FP-1) and 2H5M2e-H5FP-2H7M2e-H7FP (hereinafter M2e-FP-2), by respectively linking highly conserved sequences of two molecules of ectodomain of M2 (M2e) and one molecule of fusion peptide (FP) epitope of hemagglutinin (HA) of H5N1 and H7N9 influenza viruses in different orders. The Escherichia coli-expressed M2e-FP-1 and M2e-FP-2 proteins induced similarly high-titer M2e-FP-specific antibodies in the immunized mice. Importantly, both proteins were able to prevent lethal challenge of heterologous H1N1 influenza virus, with significantly reduced viral titers and alleviated pathological changes in the lungs, as well as increased body weight and complete survivals, in the challenge mice. Taken together, our study demonstrates that highly conserved M2e and FP epitope of HA of H5N1 and H7N9 influenza viruses can be used as important targets for development of safe and economical universal influenza vaccines, and that the position of H7N9 M2e and H5N1 HA epitope sequences in the vaccine components has no significant effects on the immunogenicity and efficacy of M2e-FP-based subunit vaccines.

Evacuation of Intensive Care Units During Disaster: Learning From the Hurricane Sandy Experience

OBJECTIVE: Data on best practices for evacuating an intensive care unit (ICU) during a disaster are limited. The impact of Hurricane Sandy on New York City area hospitals provided a unique opportunity to learn from the experience of ICU providers about their preparedness, perspective, roles, and activities. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of nurses, respiratory therapists, and physicians who played direct roles during the Hurricane Sandy ICU evacuations. RESULTS: Sixty-eight health care professionals from 4 evacuating hospitals completed surveys (35% ICU nurses, 21% respiratory therapists, 25% physicians-in-training, and 13% attending physicians). Only 21% had participated in an ICU evacuation drill in the past 2 years and 28% had prior training or real-life experience. Processes were inconsistent for patient prioritization, tracking, transport medications, and transport care. Respondents identified communication (43%) as the key barrier to effective evacuation. The equipment considered most helpful included flashlights (24%), transport sleds (21%), and oxygen tanks and respiratory therapy supplies (19%). An evacuation wish list included walkie-talkies/phones (26%), lighting/electricity (18%), flashlights (10%), and portable ventilators and suction (16%). CONCLUSIONS: ICU providers who evacuated critically ill patients during Hurricane Sandy had little prior knowledge of evacuation processes or vertical evacuation experience. The weakest links in the patient evacuation process were communication and the availability of practical tools. Incorporating ICU providers into hospital evacuation planning and training, developing standard evacuation communication processes and tools, and collecting a uniform dataset among all evacuating hospitals could better inform critical care evacuation in the future.

Interleukin-4 induces proliferation and activation of microglia but suppresses their induction of class II major histocompatibility complex antigen expression

We recently found that microglia, brain macrophages, express interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor mRNA in vitro. Since IL-4 exhibits a variety of functions on the cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage, we examined the effects of IL-4on the functions of microglia. Recombinant IL-4 induced the proliferation of microglia in a dose- and time-dependent manner as determined by MTT colorimetric assay, [(3)H]thymidine uptake and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. IL-4 also synergistically enhanced the proliferation of microglia with such colony-stimulating factors as IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). It also increased acid phosphatase activity and superoxide anion formation by these cells. Despite these positive effects on proliferation and activation, IL-4 suppressed the IFN γ-induced class II MHC antigen expression in these cells. Since these effects of recombinant IL-4 inhibited by the addition of monoclonal antibody against IL-4 receptors, the effects of IL-4 on microglia appear to be a specific function via IL-4 receptors. Although microglia and astrocytes produce a variety of immunoregulatory cytokines, neither cell produced IL-4 as determined by bioassay or detection of IL-4 mRNA by RT-PCR method. Thus, the exogenous IL-4 may contribute to the accumulation of microglia in or around inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system, and may be involved in the regulatory mechanisms of microglia.

MVA Vectored Vaccines Encoding Rift Valley Fever Virus Glycoproteins Protect Mice against Lethal Challenge in the Absence of Neutralizing Antibody Responses

In vitro neutralizing antibodies have been often correlated with protection against Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection. We have reported previously that a single inoculation of sucrose-purified modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) encoding RVFV glycoproteins (rMVAGnGc) was sufficient to induce a protective immune response in mice after a lethal RVFV challenge. Protection was related to the presence of glycoprotein specific CD8+ cells, with a low-level detection of in vitro neutralizing antibodies. In this work we extended those observations aimed to explore the role of humoral responses after MVA vaccination and to study the contribution of each glycoprotein antigen to the protective efficacy. Thus, we tested the efficacy and immune responses in BALB/c mice of recombinant MVA viruses expressing either glycoprotein Gn (rMVAGn) or Gc (rMVAGc). In the absence of serum neutralizing antibodies, our data strongly suggest that protection of vaccinated mice upon the RVFV challenge can be achieved by the activation of cellular responses mainly directed against Gc epitopes. The involvement of cellular immunity was stressed by the fact that protection of mice was strain dependent. Furthermore, our data suggest that the rMVA based single dose vaccination elicits suboptimal humoral immune responses against Gn antigen since disease in mice was exacerbated upon virus challenge in the presence of rMVAGnGc or rMVAGn immune serum. Thus, Gc-specific cellular immunity could be an important component in the protection after the challenge observed in BALB/c mice, contributing to the elimination of infected cells reducing morbidity and mortality and counteracting the deleterious effect of a subneutralizing antibody immune response.

Rat tracheal organ culture supports replication of parainfluenza 1 (6/94) virus and promotes 6/94 virus rescue from latently infected human brain cells

Rat tracheal organ culture (TOC) supported replication of parainfluenza 1 (6/94) virus. Cell‐associated and cell‐free viruses were found after primary infection of TOC. In contrast to other mammalian systems, rat TOC was capable of maintaining 6/94 virus infectivity after primary infection. Rat TOC may be considered a potential indicator system that could be used to detect virus latent in human tissue.

Mouse hepatitis virus infection of mice causes long-term depletion of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus-permissive macrophages and T lymphocyte alterations

Intraperitoneal injection of pathogen-free B10.A mice with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59 resulted in a short subclinical infection which was terminated by a rapid antiviral immune response. The infection resulted in a rapid, but transient, about 10-fold increase in the number of macrophages and total cells in the peritoneum of the mice. This increase was preceded by a complete depletion of the peritoneum of the subpopulation of macrophages that supports a productive infection by lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV). The depletion of LDV-permissive macrophages was a long-term effect; at 50 days post-infection with MHV, the proportion of LDV-permissive macrophages in the peritoneum had reached only 20% of that observed in the peritoneum of uninfected mice, whereas the total number of macrophages in the peritoneum had returned to normal. Furthermore, MHV infection resulted in a long-term alteration in the proliferative response of spleen T cells to concanavalin A (ConA) and in their ability to produce interferon γ; several times higher concentrations of ConA were required to induce a maximum proliferative response in spleen T cell populations from 5-week MHV-infected B10.A mice than in spleen T cell populations from infected companion mice but the former produced 5 times more interferon γ than the T cells from unifected mice.

Virology of hepatitis C virus

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been identified as the main causative agent of post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis. Through recently developed diagnostic assays, routine serologic screening of blood donors has prevented most cases of post-transfusion hepatitis. The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively review current information regarding the virology of HCV. Recent findings on the genome organization, its relationship to other viruses, the replication of HCV ribonucleic acid, HCV translation, and HCV polyprotein expression and processing are discussed. Also reviewed are virus assembly and release, the variability of HCV and its classification into genotypes, the geographic distribution of HCV genotypes, and the biologic differences between HCV genotypes. The assays used in HCV genotyping are discussed in terms of reliability and consistency of results, and the molecular epidemiology of HCV infection is reviewed. These approaches to HCV epidemiology will prove valuable in documenting the spread of HCV in different risk groups, evaluating alternative (nonparenteral) routes of transmission, and in understanding more about the origins and evolution of HCV.

Effectiveness comparison of indocyanine green retention test with the cirrhotic severity scoring in evaluating the pathological severity of liver cirrhosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and Child-Pugh grade A liver function

BACKGROUND: Evaluating cirrhotic severity is essential for individualizing surgical modalities for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our previous study proposed a non-invasive method named cirrhotic severity scoring (CSS) to stage liver cirrhosis. Indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICG-R15) has been widely used for the preoperative evaluation of hepatic functional reserve; however, whether ICG-R15 is well correlated with cirrhotic severity, and especially whether comparable with CSS in predicting cirrhotic severity in HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function remains unknown. METHODS: Overall, 510 HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function undergoing hepatectomy between January 2011 and December 2014 were retrospectively studied. Cirrhotic severity was pathologically assessed using the Laennec staging system. The correlations between ICG-R15, CSS, and cirrhotic severity were analyzed. Furthermore, the performance of ICG-R15 and CSS in predicting posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) and 90-day mortality was compared. RESULTS: Patients with no, mild, moderate, and severe cirrhosis accounted for 15.9%, 29.2%, 35.9%, and 19.0%, respectively, in the entire cohort. ICG-R15 was found to be less than 10% in 100%, 93.3%, 86.3%, and 70.1% of the patients with no, mild, moderate, and severe cirrhosis, respectively. There was only a weak correlation between ICG-R15 and the pathological severity of liver cirrhosis (r = 0.325; P < 0.001). However, CSS showed a strong correlation with the pathological severity of liver cirrhosis (r = 0.788; P < 0.001). For those with ICG-R15 in the normal range, the accuracy of CSS in diagnosing no/mild, moderate, and severe cirrhosis was 89.1%, 72.8%, and 72.1%, respectively. In addition, CSS was superior to ICG-R15 in predicting PHLF and 90-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: CSS was more useful than ICG-R15 in the preoperative assessment of cirrhotic severity in HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function. More studies are needed to further validate CSS in patients with different Child-Pugh grades.

Performance of an N95 Filtering Facepiece Particulate Respirator and a Surgical Mask During Human Breathing: Two Pathways for Particle Penetration

The protection level offered by filtering facepiece particulate respirators and face masks is defined by the percentage of ambient particles penetrating inside the protection device. There are two penetration pathways: (1) through the faceseal leakage, and the (2) filter medium. This study aimed at differentiating the contributions of these two pathways for particles in the size range of 0.03–1 μm under actual breathing conditions. One N95 filtering facepiece respirator and one surgical mask commonly used in health care environments were tested on 25 subjects (matching the latest National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health fit testing panel) as the subjects performed conventional fit test exercises. The respirator and the mask were also tested with breathing manikins that precisely mimicked the prerecorded breathing patterns of the tested subjects. The penetration data obtained in the human subject- and manikin-based tests were compared for different particle sizes and breathing patterns. Overall, 5250 particle size- and exercise-specific penetration values were determined. For each value, the faceseal leakage-to-filter ratio was calculated to quantify the relative contributions of the two penetration pathways. The number of particles penetrating through the faceseal leakage of the tested respirator/mask far exceeded the number of those penetrating through the filter medium. For the N95 respirator, the excess was (on average) by an order of magnitude and significantly increased with an increase in particle size (p < 0.001): ∼7-fold greater for 0.04 μm, ∼10-fold for 0.1 μm, and ∼20-fold for 1 μm. For the surgical mask, the faceseal leakage-to-filter ratio ranged from 4.8 to 5.8 and was not significantly affected by the particle size for the tested submicrometer fraction. Facial/body movement had a pronounced effect on the relative contribution of the two penetration pathways. Breathing intensity and facial dimensions showed some (although limited) influence. Because most of the penetrated particles entered through the faceseal, the priority in respirator/mask development should be shifted from improving the efficiency of the filter medium to establishing a better fit that would eliminate or minimize faceseal leakage.

Epidemic Threshold in Continuous-Time Evolving Networks

Current understanding of the critical outbreak condition on temporal networks relies on approximations (time scale separation, discretization) that may bias the results. We propose a theoretical framework to compute the epidemic threshold in continuous time through the infection propagator approach. We introduce the weak commutation condition allowing the interpretation of annealed networks, activity-driven networks, and time scale separation into one formalism. Our work provides a coherent connection between discrete and continuous time representations applicable to realistic scenarios.

Association study of genetic polymorphisms in proteins involved in oseltamivir transport, metabolism, and interactions with adverse reactions in Mexican patients with acute respiratory diseases

Oseltamivir, a pro-drug, is the best option for treatment and chemoprophylaxis for influenza outbreaks. However, many patients treated with oseltamivir developed adverse reactions, including hypersensitivity, gastritis, and neurological symptoms. The aim of this study was to determine the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in Mexican patients treated with oseltamivir and whether these ADRs are associated with SNPs of the genes involved in the metabolism, transport, and interactions of oseltamivir. This study recruited 310 Mexican patients with acute respiratory diseases and treated them with oseltamivir (75 mg/day for 5 days) because they were suspected to have influenza A/H1N1 virus infection. Clinical data were obtained from medical records and interviews. Genotyping was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction and TaqMan probes. The association was assessed under genetic models with contingency tables and logistic regression analysis. Out of 310 patients, only 38 (12.25%) presented ADRs to oseltamivir: hypersensitivity (1.9%), gastritis (10%), and depression and anxiety (0.9%). The polymorphism ABCB1-rs1045642 was associated with adverse drug reactions under the recessive model (P = 0.017); allele C was associated with no adverse drug reactions, while allele T was associated with adverse drug reactions. The polymorphisms SLC15A1-rs2297322, ABCB1-rs2032582, and CES1-rs2307243 were not consistent with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, and no other associations were found for the remaining polymorphisms. In conclusion, the polymorphism rs1045642 in the transporter encoded by the ABCB1 gene is a potential predictive biomarker of ADRs in oseltamivir treatment.

Protective cellular immune response against hepatitis C virus elicited by chimeric protein formulations in BALB/c mice

The eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a public health priority. Despite the efficiency of treatment with direct-acting antivirals, the high cost of the therapy and the lack of accurate data about the HCV-infected population worldwide constitute important factors hampering this task. Hence, an affordable preventive vaccine is still necessary for reducing transmission and the future disease burden globally. In this work, chimeric proteins (EnvCNS3 and NS3EnvCo) encompassing conserved and immunogenic epitopes from the HCV core, E1, E2 and NS3 proteins were produced in Escherichia coli, and their immunogenicity was evaluated in BALB/c mice. The impact of recombinant HCV E2.680 protein and oligodeoxynucleotide 39M (ODN39M) on the immune response to chimeric proteins was also assessed. Immunization with chimeric proteins mixed with E2.680 enhanced the antibody and cellular response against HCV antigens and chimeric proteins. Interestingly, the combination of NS3EnvCo with E2.680 and ODN39M as adjuvant elicited a potent antibody response characterized by an increase in antibodies of the IgG2a subclass against E2.680, NS3 and chimeric proteins, suggesting the induction of a Th1-type response. Moreover, a cytotoxic T lymphocyte response and a broad response of IFN-γ-secreting cells against HCV antigens were induced with this formulation as well. This T cell response was able to protect vaccinated mice against challenge with a surrogate model based on HCV recombinant vaccinia virus. Overall, the vaccine candidate NS3EnvCo/E2.680/ODN39M might constitute an effective immunogen against HCV with potential for reducing the likelihood of viral persistence.

Lissencephaly in Shih Tzu dogs

BACKGROUND: Lissencephaly is a brain malformation characterized by smooth and thickened cerebral surface, which may result in structural epilepsy. Lissencephaly is not common in veterinary medicine. Here, we characterize the first cases of lissencephaly in four Shih Tzu dogs, including clinical presentations and findings of magnetic resonance imaging of lissencephaly and several concomitant brain malformations. CASE PRESENTATION: Early-onset acute signs of forebrain abnormalities were observed in all dogs, which were mainly cluster seizures and behavioral alterations. Based on neurological examination, the findings were consistent with symmetrical and bilateral forebrain lesions. Metabolic disorders and inflammatory diseases were excluded. Magnetic resonance imaging for three dogs showed diffuse neocortical agyria and thickened gray matter while one dog had mixed agyria and pachygyria. Other features, such as internal hydrocephalus, supracollicular fluid accumulation, and corpus callosum hypoplasia, were detected concomitantly. Antiepileptic drugs effectively controlled cluster seizures, however, sporadic isolated seizures and signs of forebrain abnormalities, such as behavioral alterations, central blindness, and strabismus persisted. CONCLUSIONS: Lissencephaly should be considered an important differential diagnosis in Shih Tzu dogs presenting with early-onset signs of forebrain abnormalities, including cluster seizures and behavioral alterations. Magnetic resonance imaging was appropriate for ante-mortem diagnosis of lissencephaly and associated cerebral anomalies.

Complications Among Adults Hospitalized With Influenza: A Comparison of Seasonal Influenza and the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic

Background. Persons with influenza can develop complications that result in hospitalization and death. These are most commonly respiratory related, but cardiovascular or neurologic complications or exacerbations of underlying chronic medical conditions may also occur. Patterns of complications observed during pandemics may differ from typical influenza seasons, and characterizing variations in influenza-related complications can provide a better understanding of the impact of pandemics and guide appropriate clinical management and planning for the future. Methods. Using a population-based surveillance system, we compared clinical complications using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) discharge diagnosis codes in adults hospitalized with seasonal influenza (n = 5270) or 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (H1N1pdm09; n = 4962). Results. Adults hospitalized with H1N1pdm09 were younger (median age, 47 years) than those with seasonal influenza (median age, 68 years; P < .01), and differed in the frequency of certain underlying medical conditions. Whereas there was similar risk for many influenza-associated complications, after controlling for age and type of underlying medical condition, adults hospitalized with H1N1pdm09 were more likely to have lower respiratory tract complications, shock/sepsis, and organ failure than those with seasonal influenza. They were also more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit, require mechanical ventilation, or die. Young adults, in particular, had 2–4 times the risk of severe outcomes from H1N1pdm09 than persons of the same ages with seasonal influenza. Conclusions. Although H1N1pdm09 was thought of as a relatively mild pandemic, these data highlight the impact of the 2009 pandemic on the risk of severe influenza, especially among younger adults, and the impact this virus may continue to have.

Viral pathogens and epidemiology, detection, therapy and resistance

Worldwide community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most frequent infectious diseases and a leading cause of death. Several studies have shown that a pathogen could be identified only in 50 to 60% of all patients, although in children < 6 month infectious agents can be detected in about 90%. Viral infections are most frequent in children < 2 years (80%), whereas bacterial infections increase with age. RSV, influenzaviruses, rhinoviruses, parainfluenzaviruses and adenoviruses are the most common viruses associated with CAP in children. Among adenoviruses a predominance of adenovirus 7 has been reported in several countries with emergence of highly pathogenic variants with significant lethality in young children. Many childhood respiratory infections are caused by more than one pathogen and up to 30% mixed viral / bacterial infections can be observed. CAP in immunocompetent adults is rare, whereas persons with underlaying diseases have an increased incidence of CAP. In the elderly, RSV, influenzaviruses, parainfluenzaviruses and less frequent adenoviruses are predominant viruses causing pneumonia. Less frequently associated with CAP are the newly discovered human metapneumovirus and the coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1. Hantaviruses, involved in the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, belong to the emerging pathogens to date in North, Middle and South America. For optimum diagnosis the whole spectrum of potential respiratory viral agents should be included and multiple diagnostic techniques have to be used. In view of the high relevance of influenzavirus for CAP influenza vaccination is highly advisable for prevention of CAP, especially in high-risk groups.

Human Coronaviruses

Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs) are recognised to be an important cause of the common cold. In 1962 HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 where first recognised, more recently HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU-1 have been discovered in respiratory specimens from children and adults [3]. This protocol describes two real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods, a single target and triplex RT-PCR that identifies and differentiates HCoV infection.

Multidrug Resistant Gram-Negative Bacteria in Community-Acquired Pneumonia

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with high morbidity and mortality worldwide [1]. Although several different bacteria and respiratory viruses can be responsible for CAP, Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) remains the most common causative pathogen. A small proportion of CAP cases are caused by Gram-negative bacteria, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomona maltophilia [2, 3]. The main problem concerning the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections is their related antibiotic resistance, reported as multidrug resistant (MDR = resistant to at least one agent in three or more groups of antibiotics), extensively drug resistant (XDR = resistant to at least one agent in all but two or fewer groups of antibiotics) and pan-drug resistant (PDR = resistant to all groups of antibiotics) [4]. This makes the clinical management of pneumonia caused by such pathogens a challenge for physicians. Taking into account the clinical severity that may be associated with CAP caused by Gram-negative bacteria (respiratory failure, bacteremia, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) the magnitude of the global health problem is tremendous.

Reconfiguring Species for Immunitary Hybridity

Like blood, transplantation is a singularly defining expression of the contemporary biopolitics of immunity. This chapter focuses on the contentious clinical and research domain of transpecies transplantation, or xenotransplantation. Where the previous chapter was primarily concerned with the biopolitics of immunitary circuits between humans, this discussion turns towards our changing biotechnological relationship to other species, other immunitary animals. Whilst the approach may well offer a therapeutically life-saving solution for transplant patients, it potentially provides a means of transferring contagious diseases across species barriers. The chapter explores, with reference to Derrida and Sloterdijk, the tendency of immunitary purification and protection to recoil back upon their original designs. The chapter asks what might it mean to place trust in, or have confidence in, biosecurity measures that make the realisation of a threat (pandemics, xenozoonotic disease outbreaks, etc) more possible, not less so.

Telencephalon: Neocortex

The neocortex is an ultracomplex, six-layered structure that develops from the dorsal palliai sector of the telencephalic hemispheres (Figs. 2.24, 2.25, 11.1). All mammals, including monotremes and marsupials, possess a neocortex, but in reptiles, i.e. the ancestors of mammals, only a three-layered neocortical primordium is present [509, 511]. The term neocortex refers to its late phylogenetic appearance, in comparison to the “palaeocortical” olfactory cortex and the “archicortical” hippocampal cortex, both of which are present in all amniotes [509].

Management of Gram-Positive Bacterial Disease: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcal, Pneumococcal and Enterococcal Infections

Gram-positive bacteria are a diverse group of organisms that are a major source of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. The increasing use of long-term indwelling central catheters and cytotoxic chemotherapies has contributed to the emergence of Gram-positive bacteria as the leading cause of bacteremia in cancer patients. These organisms are also among the foremost causes of pneumonia, skin and soft-tissue infections, osteomyelitis, and central nervous system infections in cancer patients. Gram-positive organisms have a remarkable ability to develop resistance to many of the currently available antimicrobials, but the predilection to become antimicrobial resistant varies substantially for particular organisms and for individual antimicrobial agents. Therefore physicians treating cancer patients need to be familiar with the common clinical manifestations, complications, and treatment options for a wide variety of diseases caused by Gram-positive bacteria.

Mining Candidate Viruses as Potential Bio-terrorism Weapons from Biomedical Literature

In this paper we present a semantic-based data mining approach to identify candidate viruses as potential bio-terrorism weapons from biomedical literature. We first identify all the possible properties of viruses as search key words based on Geissler’s 13 criteria; the identified properties are then defined using MeSH terms. Then, we assign each property an importance weight based on domain experts’ judgment. After generating all the possible valid combinations of the properties, we search the biomedical literature, retrieving all the relevant documents. Next our method extracts virus names from the downloaded documents for each search keyword and identifies the novel connection of the virus according to these 4 properties. If a virus is found in the different document sets obtained by several search keywords, the virus should be considered as suspicious and treated as candidate viruses for bio-terrorism. Our findings are intended as a guide to the virus literature to support further studies that might then lead to appropriate defense and public health measures.

Role of Fibrinolysis in the Nasal System

In this chapter, we show the presence of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in nasal mucosa. It is suggested that t-PA synthesized in mucous cells is promptly secreted and modifies the watery nasal discharge in allergic rhinitis and that u-PA activity may help with the passage of large amounts of rhinorrhea by reducing its viscosity. Furthermore, we clarify the relation between fibrinolytic components and the pathology of allergy, particularly during the development of nasal allergy and nasal tissue changes. Wild-type (WT) mice can develop nasal allergy for ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization, but PAI-1-deficient mice (PAI-1(-/-)) cannot. The production of specific immunoglobulins IgG1 and IgE in the serum and production of interleukins IL-4 and IL-5 in splenocyte culture supernatant increased significantly in WT-OVA mice. In PAI-1(-/-) mice, these reactions were absent, and specific IgG2a in serum and interferon-γ in splenocyte culture medium increased significantly. Histopathologically, there was marked goblet cell hyperplasia and eosinophil infiltration into the nasal mucosa in WT-OVA mice, but these were absent in PAI-1(-/-) mice. These results indicate that the immune response in WT-OVA mice can be classified as a dominant Th2 response, which would promote collagen deposition. In contrast, the Th2 response in PAI-1(-/-) mice was down-regulated and the immune response shifted from Th2-dominant reaction to a Th1-dominant one. Taken together, these findings suggest that PAI-1 plays an important role not only in thrombolysis but also in the immune response.

Infections in Heart, Lung, and Heart-Lung Transplantation

Half a century has passed since the first orthotopic heart transplant took place. Surgical innovations allowed for heart, lung, and heart-lung transplantation to save lives of patients with incurable chronic cardiopulmonary conditions. The complexity of the surgical interventions, chronic host health conditions, and antirejection immunosuppressive medications makes infectious complications common. Infections have remained one of the main barriers for successful transplantation and a source of significant morbidity and mortality. Recognition of infections and its management in this setting require outstanding clinical skills since transplant recipients may not exhibit classic signs or symptoms of disease, and laboratory work has some pitfalls. The prevention, identification, and management of infectious diseases complications in this population are a priority to undertake to improve the medical outcomes of transplantation. Herein, we reviewed the historical aspects, epidemiology, and prophylaxis of infections in heart, lung, and heart-lung transplantation. We also discuss the most prevalent organisms affecting the host and the organ systems involved.

Multifaceted Antiviral Actions of Interferon-stimulated Gene Products

Interferons (IFNs) are extremely powerful cytokines for the host defence against viral infections. Binding of IFNs to their receptors activates the JAK/STAT signalling pathway with the Janus kinases JAK1, 2 and TYK2 and the signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT2. Depending on the cellular setting, additional STATs (STAT3-6) and additional signalling pathways are activated. The actions of IFNs on infected cells and the surrounding tissue are mediated by the induction of several hundred IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Since the cloning of the first ISGs, considerable progress has been made in describing antiviral effector proteins and their many modes of action. Effector proteins individually target distinct steps in the viral life cycle, including blocking virus entry, inhibition of viral transcription and translation, modification of viral nucleic acids and proteins and, interference with virus assembly and budding. Novel pathways of viral inhibition are constantly being elucidated and, additionally, unanticipated functions of known antiviral effector proteins are discovered. Herein, we outline IFN-induced antiviral pathways and review recent developments in this fascinating area of research.

Role of Heat Shock Proteins in Viral Infection

One of the most intriguing and less known aspects of the interaction between viruses and their host is the impact of the viral infection on the heat shock response (HSR). While both a positive and a negative role of different heat shock proteins (HSP) in the control of virus replication has been hypothesized, HSP function during the virus replication cycle is still not well understood. This chapter describes different aspects of the interactions between viruses and heat shock proteins during infection of mammalian cells: the first part focuses on the modulation of the heat shock response by human viral pathogens; the second describes the interactions of HSP and other chaperones with viral components, and their function during different steps of the virus replication cycle; the last part summarizes our knowledge on the effect of hyperthermia and HSR modulators on virus replication.

Intestinal/Multivisceral Transplantation

Intestinal/multivisceral transplantation has evolved from an experimental procedure to the treatment of choice for patients with irreversible intestinal failure and serious complications related to long-term parenteral nutrition. Children who are likely to suffer permanent intestinal failure and benefit from intestinal transplantation include those with a remaining small bowel length of less than 30–40 cm, absence of the ileocecal valve, colonic resection and malabsorptive syndromes. Indications for transplant include frequent severe bouts of catheter associated sepsis, threatened loss of vascular access and the development of liver cirrhosis from cholestasis. Children who are more likely to experience cholestasis from total parenteral nutrition include those who experience persistent hyperbilirubinemia (greater than 6 mg/dl despite enteral nutrition), those with recurrent sepsis and/or bacterial overgrowth and those with minimal tolerance of any enteral feeds in the first few months post resection. The 1 year survival rate after intestinal transplantation has markedly improved over the last several years but long term survival rates have remained unchanged. The improved short term survival rates have led to an increased prevalence of this patient population in intensive care units. Management of intestinal and multivisceral transplant recipients is uniquely challenging because of complications arising from the high incidence of transplant rejection and its treatment. In the ICU, the complexity of medical care for the transplant recipient requires a multidisciplinary approach with coordination by an intensivist in collaboration with the transplant surgeon, gastroenterologist, and other specialists.

Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine for Infectious Diseases

Humans have been plagued by the scourge of invasion by pathogens leading to infectious diseases from the time in memoriam and are still the cause of morbidity and mortality among millions of individuals. Trying to understand the disease mechanisms and finding the remedial measures have been the quest of humankind. The susceptibility to disease of an individual in a given population is determined by ones genetic buildup. Response to treatment and the disease prognosis also depends upon individual’s genetic predisposition. The environmental stress induces mutations and is leading to the emergence of ever-increasing more dreaded infectious pathogens, and now we are in the era of increasing antibiotic resistance that has thrown up a challenge to find new treatment regimes. Discoveries in the science of high-throughput sequencing and array technologies have shown new hope and are bringing a revolution in human health. The information gained from sequencing of both human and pathogen genomes is a way forward in deciphering host-pathogen interactions. Deciphering the pathogen virulence factors, host susceptibility genes, and the molecular programs involved in the pathogenesis of disease has paved the way for discovery of new molecular targets for drugs, diagnostic markers, and vaccines. The genomic diversity in the human population leads to differences in host responses to drugs and vaccines and is the cause of poor response to treatment as well as adverse reactions. The study of pharmacogenomics of infectious diseases is still at an early stage of development, and many intricacies of the host-pathogen interaction are yet to be understood in full measure. However, progress has been made over the decades of research in some of the important infectious diseases revealing how the host genetic polymorphisms of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters affect the bioavailability of the drugs which further determine the efficacy and toxicology of the drugs used for treatment. Further, the field of structural biology and chemistry has intertwined to give rise to medical structural genomics leading the way to the discovery of new drug targets against infectious diseases. This chapter explores how the advent of “omics” technologies is making a beginning in bringing about a change in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatments of the infectious diseases and hence paving way for personalized medicine.

South and East Asian Insurance Market Growth and Development

Recent economic research, notably by King and Levine (1993a, 1993b), Levine and Zervos (1998), Levine (1999), Levine, et al. (2000), and Beck, et al. (2000), indicates that financial services and its various components, including insurance and banking, have substantial potential for spreading positive externalities throughout the commercial sector of an economy. Such benefits can stem from improved access to capital by firms, better allocation of capital to investment projects, greater risk management, and enhanced portfolio diversification and liquidity for individual investors. While existing economic research shows the development of financial services is generally important for economic growth, a number of previous studies by Outreville (1990) and Ward and Zurbruegg (2000) provide empirical evidence that insurance market development in its own right can promote economic development. The importance of the insurance industry to the wider economy is seen to stem from the relative size of the insurance industry to GDP in many developed economies, the transfer of risks, and the scale of insurance companies’ financial intermediary functions.

Rationale for the Existence of Zoos

This chapter looks at the stated goals of zoo mission statements and provides examples of how zoos are addressing their missions. Moreover, with the pressure of zoos to become biological conservation mentors, zoos assume five roles as the executor of the relationship between society and nature. First, zoos take on the role of the “model citizen” by conveying a conservation message. They advocate for a sensible, sustainable use of natural resources and promote less wasteful, green-building alternatives. Many zoological institutions are developing organizational plans that include the use of solar, wind, and thermal power in their daily operations. Additionally, they are growing food for the animals, composting, and using recycled materials in their exhibit design. Second, zoos are maintaining a viable and genetically diverse collection. Zoos are managed under the premise that wildlife conservation is of foremost importance. As zoological institutions have become more active in field studies, their research findings are being applied to larger conservation efforts. Moreover, the conservation research that takes place in situ and ex situ is important in saving small fragmented wild populations. Third, zoos directly influence the attitudes and behaviors of the community in relation to the conservation of plants, animals, and habitats. Due to their urban locations within heavily populated cities, zoos have a unique geographic placement within the community. The urban location of zoos provides them with a unique opportunity to influence government policy. Fourth, the zoo is a conservation mentor. Through mentoring efforts, future generations of scientists and citizens will be more aware of the benefits of long-term conservation. As conservation mentors, zoos must lead the public to become citizen conservationist. Fifth, zoos are a place for people to learn basic facts about organisms and their behavior.

Characterization of Synonymous Codon Usage in the Newly Identified Duck Plague Virus UL16 Gene

A comparative analysis of the codon usage bias in the newly identified UL16 gene(GenBank accession no.EU195095) of DPV and the UL16 gene of 22 reference herpesviruses was performed. In this study, the synonymous codon usage bias of UL16 gene in the 23 herpesviruses have been analyzed and the results showed obvious differences by the CAI, RSCU, ENC and GC(3s). The results revealed that the synonymous codons with A and T at the third codon positon have widely usage in the codon of UL16 gene of DPV. The ENC-GC(3s) plot revealed that the genetic heterogeneity in UL16 gene of herpesviruses was constrained by G+C content at the third codon position. The phylogenetic analysis suggested that DPV was evolutionarily closer to herpesviruses which further clustered into Alphaherpesvirinae. Furthermore the ORF of DPV UL16 gene has sequential rare codons. There were 21 codons showing distinct usage differences between DPV with Escherichia coli, 19 codons showing distinct usage differences between DPV with yeast, and 20 between DPV and Human. Therefore the Escherichia coli, Yeast and Human expression system were suitable for the expression of DPV UL16 gene if some codons could be optimized.

Community-acquired pneumonia: paving the way towards new vaccination concepts

Despite the availability of antimicrobial agents and vaccines, community-acquired pneumonia remains a serious problem. Severe forms tend to occur in very young children and among the elderly, since their immune competence is eroded by immaturity and immune senescence, respectively. The main etiologic agents differ according to patient age and geographic area. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV-3) are the most important pathogens in children, whereas influenza viruses are the leading cause of fatal pneumonia in the elderly. Effective vaccines are available against some of these organisms. However, there are still many agents against which vaccines are not available or the existent ones are suboptimal. To tackle this problem, empiric approaches are now being systematically replaced by rational vaccine design. This is facilitated by the growing knowledge in the fields of immunology, microbial pathogenesis and host response to infection, as well as by the availability of sophisticated strategies for antigen selection, potent immune modulators and efficient antigen delivery systems. Thus, a new generation of vaccines with improved safety and efficacy profiles compared to old and new agents is emerging. In this chapter, an overview is provided about currently available and new vaccination concepts.

Pathogenesis of Sepsis

Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection. Both hyperinflammation and immune suppression ensue, to an extent that is harmful to the host. The inflammatory balance is disturbed, and this is associated with a failure to return to homeostasis. All pathogens with sufficient load and virulence can cause sepsis, after they succeed to adhere and pass the mucosal barrier of the host. The host defense system can recognize molecular components of invading pathogens, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), with specialized receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Through several signaling pathways, overstimulation of PRRs has proinflammatory and immune suppressive consequences. Hyperinflammation is characterized by activation of target genes coding for proinflammatory cytokines (leukocyte activation), inefficient use of the complement system, activation of the coagulation system, and concurrent downregulation of anticoagulant mechanisms and necrotic cell death. The release of endogenous molecules by injured cells, called danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or alarmins, leads to deterioration in a vicious cycle by further stimulation of PRRs. Features of immune suppression are massive apoptosis and thereby depletion of immune cells, reprogramming of monocytes and macrophages to a state of a decreased capacity to release proinflammatory cytokines and a disturbed balance in cellular metabolic processes.

Disasters as Extreme Events and the Importance of Network Interactions for Disaster Response Management

We discuss why disasters occur more frequently and are more serious than expected according to a normal distribution. Moreover, we investigate the interaction networks responsible for the cascade-like spreading of disasters. Such causality networks allow one to estimate the development of disasters with time, to give hints about when to take certain actions, to assess the suitability of alternative measures of emergency management, and to anticipate their side effects. Finally, we identify other fields where network theory could help to improve disaster response management.

Development of a Quantitative Instrument to Measure Mobile Collaborative Learning (MCL) Using WhatsApp: The Conceptual Steps

It has been reported that WhatsApp, a social media application, had approximately 1.6 billion active users globally as of July 2019, almost one-fifth of the total world’s population. Thus, research about WhatsApp’s influence in general and especially its influence in education was relevant and significant. While there was much research involving WhatsApp and learning, it was not conclusive about the effects of WhatsApp on student learning. Specifically, research focusing on collaborative learning using WhatsApp was lacking, including research instruments for measuring collaboration on WhatsApp. Consequently, the paper’s research problem was the lack of research instruments for measuring collaboration on WhatsApp in relation to academic achievement. To address the research problem, the study followed the important initial and conceptual steps of the instrument development process to develop a research instrument to measure collaboration on WhatsApp in relation to academic achievement. The result of the paper was a developed instrument that provides researchers with a basis to measure the explanatory constructs involved in mobile collaborative learning (MCL) processes on WhatsApp and potentially other social media platforms. Therefore, the paper made an appropriately theoretical contribution, which was grounded in the scientific literature. The study facilitated positivistic research and epistemology for acquiring objective and precise scientific knowledge. Such deductive research promotes theory testing and development and presents educators and students with scientific evidence about learning with MCL applications such as WhatsApp from which both curriculum and learning design can be informed and benefited. In the age of connected mobility this is a necessity.

The Role of Self-Assembling Lipid Molecules in Vaccination

The advent of vaccines represents one of the most significant advances in medical history. The protection provided by vaccines has greatly contributed in reducing the number of cases of infections and most notably to the eradication of small pox. A large number of new technologies and approaches in vaccine development are currently being investigated with the goal of providing the basis for the next generation of prophylactics against an ever-expanding list of emerging and reemerging pathogens. In this chapter, we will focus on the role of lipids and lipid self-assembling vesicles in new and promising vaccination approaches. We will start by describing how lipids can induce activation of the innate immune system and focus on some lipid-derived vaccine adjuvants. Next, we will review current lipid-based self-assembling particles used as vaccine platforms, specifically liposomes and virus-like particles, and how virus-like particles have facilitated research of highly pathogenic viruses such as Ebola.

MathSeer: A Math-Aware Search Interface with Intuitive Formula Editing, Reuse, and Lookup

There has been growing interest in math-aware search engines that support retrieval using both formulas and keywords. An important unresolved issue is the design of search interfaces: for wide adoption, they must be engaging and easy-to-use, particularly for non-experts. The MathSeer interface addresses this with straightforward formula creation, editing, and lookup. Formulas are stored in ‘chips’ created using handwriting, [Image: see text], and images. MathSeer sessions are also stored at automatically generated URLs that save all chips and their editing history. To avoid re-entering formulas, chips can be reused, edited, or used in creating other formulas. As users enter formulas, our novel autocompletion facility returns entity cards searchable by formula or entity name, making formulas easy to (re)locate, and descriptions of symbols and notation available before queries are issued.

Current research, key performances and future development of search and rescue robots

Frequent natural disasters and man-made catastrophes have threatened the safety of citizens and have attracted much more attention. The rescue mission under disaster environment is very complicated and dangerous for a rescue team. Search and rescue (SAR) robots can not only improve the efficiency of rescue operations but also reduce the casualty of rescuers. Robots can help rescue teams and even replace rescuers to perform dangerous missions. Search and rescue robots will play a more and more important role in the rescue operations. A survey of the research status of search and rescue robots in Japan, USA, China and other countries has been provided. According to current research, experiences and the lessons learned from applications, the five key performances of a search and rescue robot are survivability, mobility, sensing, communicability and operability.

The Role of Immune Complexes Consisting of Myelin Basic Protein (MBP), Anti‐MBP Antibodies and Complement in Promoting CD4(+) T‐cell Responses to MBP in Health and Multiple Sclerosis

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune condition characterized by degeneration of nerve fibre myelin sheets. A candidate autoantigen, myelin basic protein (MBP), has especially attracted attention. The presence of anti‐MBP antibodies is a predictor of definite MS, but their role in the pathogenesis remains obscure. T cells have long been known to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of MS. Recently, an important role for B cells as autoantigen‐presenting cells has been demonstrated in other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. The uptake of MBP by B cells and the presentation of MBP‐derive peptides to T helper (Th) cells by B cells may be promoted by the formation of complement (C) activating immune complexes (ICs) between MBP and natural autoantibodies in healthy individuals and disease‐associated anti‐MBP antibodies in MS patients, respectively. We have investigated the formation of MBP‐containing IC, the binding of MBP to B cells, the MBP‐elicited induction of Th‐cell and B‐cell proliferation and the cytokine production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors grown in the presence of intact or C‐inactivated serum from healthy donors or patients with MS. While MBP did not induce measurable proliferation of B cells nor CD4(+) T cells, we observed the production of TNF‐α, IFN‐γ and IL‐10 by PBMC in response to incubation with MBP in the presence of sera from healthy controls as well as sera from MS patients. By contrast, no production of IL‐2, IL‐4 and IL‐5 was detected. We are currently investigating the capability of MS sera to promote the formation of MBP‐containing IC and thereby enhance the cytokine responses, by virtue of elevated anti‐MBP contents.

Epidemiology of Multiple Sclerosis: Environmental Factors

This chapter discusses the environmental factors associated to epidemiology of multiple sclerosis. The epidemiologic evidence points to three environ­mental risk factors—infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), low levels of vitamin D, and cigarette smoking—whose association with multiple sclerosis (MS) seems to satisfy in varying degrees most of the criteria that support causality, including temporality, strength, consis­tency, biologic gradient, and plausibility. None of these associations, however, has been tested experimentally in humans and only one––vitamin D deficiency is presently amenable to experimental interventions. The evidence, albeit more sparse and inconsistent, linking other environmental factors to MS risk are summarized. Epidemiologic clues to the hypothetical role of infection in MS are com­plex and often seem to point in opposite directions. The ecological studies, database/linkage analyses, and longitudinal studies of sunlight exposure and vitamin D are reviewed. Biologic mechanisms for smoking and increased risk of MS could be neuro­toxic, immunomodulatory, vascular, or they could involve increased frequency and duration of respiratory infections. Some other possible risk factors include––diet and hepatitis B vaccine.

Modulation of Host Cell Death by SARS Coronavirus Proteins

Both types of cell death, namely necrosis and apoptosis, are found in organs of SARS coronavirus (CoV) infected patients. The gastrointestinal tract, however, although also a target for SARS-CoV replication, is obviously not affected by cell death mechanisms. Such differences in cell death induction are paralleled by in-vitro studies. In a colon-derived cell line (Caco-2), proapoptotic proteins were down- and antiapoptotic proteins were upregulated during SARS-CoV infection. By contrast, in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells, apoptosis was induced via the p38 MAPK and caspase dependent pathways. Both apoptotic pathways, although mostly the intrinsic signal transduction, can be targeted by structural as well as accessory proteins of SARS-CoV. The fact that all structural and most of the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV are implicated in apoptotic scenarios indicates the fundamental role of apoptosis in the SARS-CoV life cycle. Interestingly, at least for the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV, a cell-type specific manipulation of apoptosis was confirmed.

Cervical Lymphadenopathy

Cervical lymphadenopathy is common in children. The condition frequently results in a child’s referral to a pediatric surgeon for further evaluation, and surgical intervention is often required. The majority of these masses represent benign disease, but the possibility of a malignancy exists. Parents often experience a significant amount of anxiety, and so it is important that pediatric surgeons are comfortable with the evaluation and management of these common lesions.

Infectious Diseases of Children

Infections are the most common cause of acute illness in children. Most commonly these are respiratory infections which peak when the child starts to go to school or out-of-home day care. Although the majority of these diseases have benign course, they cause significant discomfort, anxiety, missed work, and stress to many families caring for children. Frequent office visits, and unnecessarily prescribed medications, and sometimes dubious home remedies can be reduced by following best evidence-based practice and having a good doctor-patient (and parent) relationship.

Ex situ management of Beira antelope Dorcatragus megalotis at Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation, Qatar

Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation (AWWP), Qatar, is the only facility worldwide to keep the Beira antelope Dorcatragus megalotis, a small antelope from East Africa, listed as Vulnerable by The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Physical, behavioural and physiological characteristics of the species are described in detail, based on observations in captivity. At AWWP, the Beira antelope population increased from 2000 until 2006 when it declined dramatically as a result of an epidemic‐like outbreak of a respiratory disease most likely owing to a Mycoplasma infection. Management at AWWP includes a diet based on natural forage, careful group composition, enclosure design adapted to the need of the species and close monitoring. Apart from their important conservation status, Beira antelope are highly attractive animals with a particular shape and coloration, and a docile nature.

Novel herpesviruses in neotropical bats and their relationship with other members of the Herpesviridae family

In the past decade, a large number of studies have detected herpesvirus sequences from many bat species around the world. Nevertheless, the discovery of bat herpesviruses is geographically uneven. Of the various bat species tested to date, only a few were from the New World. Seeking to investigate the distribution and diversity of herpesviruses circulating in neotropical bats, we carried out molecular screening of 195 blood DNA samples from 11 species of three bat families (Phyllostomidae, Mormoopidae, and Molossidae). Using polymerase chain reaction amplification, with degenerate consensus primers targeting highly conserved amino acid motifs of the herpesvirus DNA polymerase and Glycoprotein B genes, we characterized novel viral sequences from all tested species. BLAST searches, pairwise nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons, as well as phylogenetic analyses confirmed that they all belonged to the Herpesviridae family, of the Beta- and Gammaherpesvirinae subfamilies. Fourteen partial DNA polymerase gene sequences, of which three beta- and 11 gamma-herpesviruses, were detected. A total of 12 partial Glycoprotein B gene sequences, all gamma-herpesviruses, were characterized. Every sequence was specific to a bat species and in some species (Desmodus rotundus, Carollia perspicillata, and Pteronotus rubiginosus) multiple viruses were found. Phylogenetic analyses of beta- and gammaherpesvirus sequences led to the identification of bat-specific clades. Those composed of sequences obtained from different bat species belonging to distinct subfamilies follow the taxonomy of bats. This study confirms the astonishing diversity of bat herpesviruses and broadens our knowledge of their host range. Nevertheless, it also emphasizes the fact that, to better appreciate the evolutionary history of these viruses, much remains to be done at various taxonomic levels.

A Cooking Knowledge Graph and Benchmark for Question Answering Evaluation in Lifelong Learning Scenarios

In a long term exploitation environment, a Question Answering (QA) system should maintain or even improve its performance over time, trying to overcome the lacks made evident through the interactions with users. We claim that, in order to make progress in the QA over Knowledge Bases (KBs) research field, we must deal with two problems at the same time: the translation of Natural Language (NL) questions into formal queries, and the detection of missing knowledge that impact the way a question is answered. The research on these two challenges has not been addressed jointly until now, what motivates the main goals of this work: (i) the definition of the problem and (ii) the development of a methodology to create the evaluation resources needed to address this challenge.

Statistical analysis plan for a cluster-randomised trial assessing the effectiveness of implementation of a bedside evidence-based checklist for clinical management of brain-dead potential organ donors in intensive care units: DONORS (Donation Network to Optimise Organ Recovery Study)

BACKGROUND: The quality of clinical care of brain-dead potential organ donors may help reduce donor losses caused by irreversible or unreversed cardiac arrest and increase the number of organs donated. We sought to determine whether an evidence-based, goal-directed checklist for donor management in intensive care units (ICUs) can reduce donor losses to cardiac arrest. METHODS/DESIGN: The DONORS study is a multicentre, cluster-randomised controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio designed to compare an intervention group (goal-directed checklist for brain-dead potential organ donor management) with a control group (standard ICU care). The primary outcome is loss of potential donors due to cardiac arrest. Secondary outcomes are the number of actual organ donors and the number of solid organs recovered per actual donor. Exploratory outcomes include the achievement of relevant clinical goals during the management of brain-dead potential organ donors. The present statistical analysis plan (SAP) describes all primary statistical procedures that will be used to evaluate the results and perform exploratory and sensitivity analyses of the trial. DISCUSSION: The SAP of the DONORS study aims to describe its analytic procedures, enhancing the transparency of the study. At the moment of SAP subsmission, 63 institutions have been randomised and were enrolling study participants. Thus, the analyses reported herein have been defined before the end of the study recruitment and database locking. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03179020. Registered on 7 June 2017.

Open Boundary Modeling in Molecular Dynamics with Machine Learning

Molecular-continuum flow simulations combine molecular dynamics (MD) and computational fluid dynamics for multiscale considerations. A specific challenge in these simulations arises due to the “open MD boundaries” at the molecular-continuum interface: particles close to these boundaries do not feel any forces from outside which results in unphysical behavior and incorrect thermodynamic pressures. In this contribution, we apply neural networks to generate approximate boundary forces that reduce these artefacts. We train our neural network with force-distance pair values from periodic MD simulations and use this network to later predict boundary force contributions in non-periodic MD systems. We study different training strategies in terms of MD sampling and training for various thermodynamic state points and report on accuracy of the arising MD system. We further discuss computational efficiency of our approach in comparison to existing boundary force models.

Robust Single Machine Scheduling with Random Blocks in an Uncertain Environment

While scheduling problems in deterministic models are quite well investigated, the same problems in an uncertain environment require very often further exploration and examination. In the paper we consider a single machine tabu search method with block approach in an uncertain environment modeled by random variables with the normal distribution. We propose a modification to the tabu search method which improves the robustness of the obtained solutions. The conducted computational experiments show that the proposed improvement results in a much more robust solutions than the ones obtained in the classic block approach.

Impact and Trends in Global Ophthalmology

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Our goal is to provide a review of the impact, global estimates, and projection of vision impairment as well as ongoing systems for eye care delivery. RECENT FINDINGS: Many of the blinding diseases in developing countries are preventable or curable, but the lack of ophthalmologists, the lack of education, and the lack of access to any eye care are some of the major obstacles encountered. SUMMARY: As our world becomes more interconnected through globalization, the interactions between different cultures and populations increase. Global ophthalmology is a field dedicated to building sustainable eye care delivery systems to deliver high-quality care in minimal resource settings, with the aim of reducing blindness around the world.

A Low Viral Dose in COVID-19 Patient: A Case Report

SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has attracted global attention. Verifying the presence of viral RNA is the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, RT-qPCR diagnosis often fails to catch infected patients, because of inconsistent swab sample collection. Here we report a case that showed 5 consecutive negative and 1 low-viral- dose RT-qPCR results during illness spanning over 20 days. Clinical symptoms suggest SARS-CoV-2 infection with typical ground glass like a lung in computed tomography. SARS-CoV-2 infection was serologically confirmed by the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in patients' serum. Finally, a high level of protective IgG was produced after the patient recovered. Surprisingly, as a barber and a housewife staying at home for the first 2 weeks after the onset of illness, none of the close contacts were infected, showing a case of low viral load and low infectivity in this patient.

Short Paper - Taming the Shape Shifter: Detecting Anti-fingerprinting Browsers

When it comes to leaked credentials and credit card information, we observe the development and use of anti-fingerprinting browsers by malicious actors. These tools are carefully designed to evade detection, often by mimicking the browsing environment of the victim whose credentials were stolen. Even though these tools are popular in the underground markets, they have not received enough attention by researchers. In this paper, we report on the first evaluation of four underground, commercial, and research anti-fingerprinting browsers and highlight their high success rate in bypassing browser fingerprinting. Despite their success against well-known fingerprinting methods and libraries, we show that even slightest variation in the simulated fingerprint compared to the real ones can give away the presence of anti-fingerprinting tools. As a result, we provide techniques and fingerprint-based signatures that can be used to detect the current generation of anti-fingerprinting browsers.

Exploration of Power Domain Partitioning with Concurrent Task Mapping and Scheduling for Application-Specific Multi-core SoCs

This paper proposes a novel approach to explore the design space of Power Domain (PD) partitioning in the architecture definition phase of heterogeneous SoCs. By formulating an Integer Linear Program (ILP), task mapping and scheduling is determined concurrently while considering power-off dependencies among cores in the same PD and the power-gating break-even time. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches aiming at design phases where task mapping and scheduling has been frozen, our proposed approach shifts joint exploration into earlier design phases, creates more power-gating opportunities for PD partitions, and thus identifies better trade-offs in terms of energy consumption and design costs.

Through thick and thin: Russia, China and the future of Eurasian International Society

Recent years have seen Moscow and Beijing driven closer together as their respective relations with Washington have deteriorated. While a normative convergence between Russia and China appears to be underway, there remains a legacy of historical mistrust in addition to potential irritants that could plague their bilateral relationship. Nonetheless, if Western sanctions against Russia and pressure on China continue unabated, they may have little option but to continue their rapprochement. Against this backdrop, this article will explore whether the two countries currently display a ‘thin’ or ‘thick’ bilateral relationship, making use of an English School theoretical framework. It will do so by exploring established English School concepts such as pluralism and solidarism and discussing notable literature within the School on contestation in order to derive conclusions regarding the potential future shape of international order in Eurasia.

Delayed Closure of 61 Open Abdomen Patients Based on an Algorithm.

Hemodynamic resuscitation, source control, and delayed abdominal closure are the three fundamental steps for open abdomen (OA) management. When to start delayed abdominal closure and how to determine which delayed closure method should be applied to each OA patient are not clarified in the literature. We evaluated an algorithm that was developed to address these two questions. A retrospective chart review was conducted for OA patients treated for according to the algorithm. When hemodynamic stabilization and source control using negative pressure therapy resulted in regression of sepsis and decreased procalcitonin levels, patients were assigned to either the skin-only or fascial closure groups according to their Björck scores and open abdominal fascial closure (OAFC) scores. The novel OAFC scoring system was created by adding age and malignancy to the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. For skin-only closure, skin flaps and skin grafts were used; for fascial closure, an abdominal re-approximation anchor system (ABRA) or ABRA plus biologic mesh was applied. From January 2008 through September 2014, 108 OA patients were managed based on the algorithm; 61 were included in this study. Abdominal closure rate was 90.2 % (55/61). Overall hospital mortality rate was 11.4 % (7/61). Small hernias developed in only 12.5 % (4/32) of the fascial closure group. In this retrospective study, the algorithm with the novel OAFC score provided practical and valid guidance to clarify when to start delayed abdominal closure and which delayed closure method to use for each OA patient.

Virtual laboratory lessons in enzymology.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread lock-down strategies that force universities to perform all educational activities remotely. In this context, laboratory lessons pose a significant challenge. Here, I present an on-line tool that simulates the kinetics of chemical reactions. Enzymatic mechanisms can be easily modeled and followed through time. In addition, professors can customize the interface to hide the reaction mechanism. This setting will force students to design virtual experiments to uncover the mechanism and obtain the relevant enzymatic parameters. While some of the skills developed in a practical lesson cannot be simulated, this tool can be used to teach students important concepts about data acquisition and processing.

Device-Based Therapy for Drug-Resistant Hypertension: An Update.

Drug-resistant hypertension (RH) remains a significant and common cardiovascular risk despite the availability of multiple potent antihypertensive medications. Uncontrolled resistant hypertension contributes substantially to excessive cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. Clinical and experimental evidence suggest that sympathetic nervous system over-activity is the main culprit for the development and maintenance of drug-resistant hypertension. Both medical and interventional strategies, targeting the sympathetic over-activation, have been designed in patients with hypertension over the past few decades. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) and carotid baroreceptor activation therapy (BAT) have been extensively evaluated in patients with RH in clinical trials. Current trial outcomes, though at times impressive, have been mostly uncontrolled trials in need of validation. Device-based therapy for drug-resistant hypertension has the potential to provide alternative treatment options to certain groups of patients who are refractory or intolerant to current antihypertensive medications. However, more research is needed to prove its efficacy in both animal models and in humans. In this article, we will review the evidence from recent renal denervation, carotid baroreceptor stimulation therapy, and newly emerged central arteriovenous anastomosis trials to pinpoint the weak links, and speculate on potential alternative approaches.

Muscarinic receptors modulate Nerve Growth Factor production in rat Schwann-like adipose-derived stem cells and in Schwann cells.

Regenerative capability of the peripheral nervous system after injury is enhanced by Schwann cells (SCs) producing several growth factors. The clinical use of SCs in nerve regeneration strategies is hindered by the necessity of removing a healthy nerve to obtain the therapeutic cells. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) can be chemically differentiated towards a SC-like phenotype (dASCs), and represent a promising alternative to SCs. Their physiology can be further modulated pharmacologically by targeting receptors for neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (ACh). In this study, we compare the ability of rat dASCs and native SCs to produce NGF in vitro. We also evaluate the ability of muscarinic receptors, in particular the M2 subtype, to modulate NGF production and maturation from the precursor (proNGF) to the mature (mNGF) form. For the first time, we demonstrate that dASCs produce higher basal levels of proNGF and mature NGF compared to SCs. Moreover, muscarinic receptor activation, and in particular M2 subtype stimulation, modulates NGF production and maturation in both SCs and dASCs. Indeed, both cell types express both proNGF A and B isoforms, as well as mNGF. After M2 receptor stimulation, proNGF-B (25 kDa), which is involved in apoptotic processes, is strongly reduced at transcript and protein level. Thus, we demonstrate that dASCs possess a stronger neurotrophic potential compared to SCs. ACh, via M2 muscarinic receptors, contributes to the modulation and maturation of NGF, improving the regenerative properties of dASCs.

Laparoscopic Gastroileal Bypass with Single Anastomosis: Analysis of the First 1512 Patients.

BACKGROUND Biliopancreatic diversion is perceived as the most effective operation for long-term treatment of massive obesity. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that gastroileal bypass with single anastomosis is a safe and feasible procedure with similar results to the classic derivation, but reducing surgical time without decreasing the efficacy. METHODS Descriptive, observational, prospective study of patients undergoing gastroileal bypass with single anastomosis between April 2010 and December 2015. The postoperative follow-up was 24 months. RESULTS One thousand five hundred twelve patients underwent gastroileal bypass. The mean time of the procedure was 32 min; the average stay was 2.2 days. 30.1% of patients lost more than 100% of their excess weight, and 72.35% of patients lost more than 75% of their excess weight. 95.17% of patients dropped to a BMI < 35; 75.99% to a BMI < 30 and 30.15% to a BMI < 25. CONCLUSIONS Gastroileal bypass with single anastomosis is a safe and fast procedure providing similar results to biliopancreatic diversion with respect to weight loss.

Post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass biliary dilation: natural process or significant entity?

BACKGROUND Changes in the biliary system after gastric bypass are not well defined. Dilation may be normal or due to biliary tract pathology. The purpose of this study is to review patients who underwent imaging of their biliary system both before and after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in an effort to elucidate the effect this operation has on hepatic duct diameter. METHODS Patients with imaging both before and at least 3 months after gastric bypass were analyzed. Hepatic duct was measured at the level of the porta hepatis to determine interval changes. RESULTS Thirty-three patients had postoperative imaging at least 3 months following gastric bypass. Mean hepatic duct diameter was 5.2 ± 2 and 7.1 ± 2.6 mm preoperatively and postoperatively, respectively (p < 0.01). Patients with prior cholecystectomy had hepatic duct diameters of 7.9 ± 1.3 and 9.5 ± 3.5 mm preoperatively and postoperatively, respectively (p = 0.3). Patients who had not previously undergone cholecystectomy had hepatic duct diameters of 4.3 ± 1.1 and 6.4 ± 1.8 mm preoperatively and postoperatively, respectively (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Hepatic duct diameter increases after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A better understanding of this phenomenon may limit the need for further work-up in patients with incidentally detected biliary dilation.

Serum Hydrogen Sulfide and Outcome Association in Pneumonia by the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirusxs.

BACKGROUND The pneumonia of COVID-19 illness has often a subtle initial presentation making mandatory the use of biomarkers for evaluation of severity and prediction of final patient disposition. We evaluated the use of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) for the outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS & METHODS We studied 74 patients with COVID-19. Clinical data were collected, and survival predictors were calculated. Blood was collected within 24 hours after admission (day 1) and on day 7. H2S was measured in sera by monobromobimane derivation (MBB) followed by high performance liquid chromatography and correlated to other markers like procalcitonin (PCT) and C- reactive protein (CRP). Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interleukin (IL)-6 were also measured in serum. RESULTS Survivors had significantly higher H2S levels on day 1 and 7 after admission. A cut-off point of 150.44 μM could discriminate survivors from non-survivors with 80% sensitivity, 73.4% specificity and negative predictive value 95.9%. Mortality after 28 days was 32% with admission levels lower or equal to 150.44 μΜ and 4.1% with levels above 150.44 μΜ (p: 0.0008). Mortality was significantly greater among patients with a decrease of H2S levels from day 1 to day 7 greater or equal to 36% (p: 0.0005). Serum H2S on day 1 was negatively correlated with IL- 6 and CRP and positively correlated with the absolute lymphocyte count in peripheral blood. CONCLUSION It is concluded that H2S is a potential marker for severity and final outcome of pneumonia by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Its correlation with IL- 6 suggests anti-inflammatory properties.

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification integrated on microfluidic chips for point-of-care quantitative detection of pathogens.

This work shows that loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of nucleic acid can be integrated in an eight-channel microfluidic chip for readout either by the naked eye (as a result of the insoluble byproduct pyrophosphate generating during LAMP amplification) or via absorbance measured by an optic sensor; we call this system microLAMP (microLAMP). It is capable of analyzing target nucleic acids quantitatively with high sensitivity and specificity. The assay is straightforward in manipulation. It requires a sample volume of 0.4 microL and is complete within 1 h. The sensitivity of the assay is comparable to standard methods, where 10 fg of DNA sample could be detected under isothermal conditions (63 degrees C). A real time quantitative microLAMP assay using absorbance detection is possible by integration of optical fibers within the chip.

18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET)-Radiomics of metastatic lymph nodes and primary tumor in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) - A prospective externally validated study.

BACKGROUND Lymph node stage prior to treatment is strongly related to disease progression and poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, few studies have investigated metabolic imaging features derived from pre-radiotherapy 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) of metastatic hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs). We hypothesized that these would provide complementary prognostic information to FDG-PET descriptors to only the primary tumor (tumor). METHODS Two independent cohorts of 262 and 50 node-positive NSCLC patients were used for model development and validation. Image features (i.e. Radiomics) including shape and size, first order statistics, texture, and intensity-volume histograms (IVH) (http://www.radiomics.io/) were evaluated by univariable Cox regression on the development cohort. Prognostic modeling was conducted with a 10-fold cross-validated least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), automatically selecting amongst FDG-PET-Radiomics descriptors from (1) tumor, (2) LNs or (3) both structures. Performance was assessed with the concordance-index. Development data are publicly available at www.cancerdata.org and Dryad (doi:10.5061/dryad.752153b). RESULTS Common SUV descriptors (maximum, peak, and mean) were significantly related to overall survival when extracted from LNs, as were LN volume and tumor load (summed tumor and LNs' volumes), though this was not true for either SUV metrics or tumor's volume. Feature selection exclusively from imaging information based on FDG-PET-Radiomics, exhibited performances of (1) 0.53 -external 0.54, when derived from the tumor, (2) 0.62 -external 0.56 from LNs, and (3) 0.62 -external 0.59 from both structures, including at least one feature from each sub-category, except IVH. CONCLUSION Combining imaging information based on FDG-PET-Radiomics features from tumors and LNs is desirable to achieve a higher prognostic discriminative power for NSCLC.

Effectiveness of a reusable low-cost balloon trocar dissection device in the creation of preperitoneal space during endoscopic surgery. An experimental study in swine.

PURPOSE To evaluate a new, low-cost, reusable balloon trocar device for dissection of the preperitoneal space during endoscopic surgery. METHODS Twenty swine (weight: 15-37 kg) were randomized to two groups, according to whether the preperitoneal space was created with a new balloon device manufactured by Bhio-Supply (group B) or with the commercially available OMSPDB 1000® balloon device manufactured by Covidien (group C). Quality and size of the created preperitoneal space, identification of anatomic structures, balloon dissection time, total procedure time, balloon resistance and internal pressure after insufflation with 300 mL of ambient air, balloon-related complications, and procedure cost were assessed. RESULTS No significant differences in dissection time, total procedure time, or size of the created preperitoneal space were found between the groups. Balloons in group B had a significantly higher internal pressure compared to balloons in group C. None of the balloons ruptured during the experiment. Three animals in group C had balloon-related peritoneal lacerations. Despite a higher individual device cost, group B had a lower procedure cost over the entire experiment. CONCLUSION The new balloon device is not inferior to the commercially available device in terms of the safety and effectiveness for creating a preperitoneal space in swine.

Oral health interventions for people living with mental disorders: protocol for a realist systematic review.

Background The increasing number of people who experience mental disorders is a global problem. People with mental disorders have high rates of co-morbidity and significantly poorer oral health outcomes than the general public. However, their oral health remains largely a hidden and neglected issue. A complex range of factors impact the oral health of this group. These include anxiety and dental phobia, dietary habits, including the heavy consumption of sugary drinks, substance misuse of tobacco, alcohol, and/or psychostimulants, the adverse orofacial side effects of anti-psychotic and anti-depression medications, and financial, geographic, and social barriers to accessing oral health care. Methods The aim of this realist systematic review is to (a) identify and synthesise evidence that explores oral health interventions for people living with mental disorders; (b) explore the context and mechanisms that have contributed to the success of interventions or the barriers and challenges; (c) produce program theories on causal, contextual and mechanistic factors to facilitate outcomes and (d) produce recommendations and guidelines to guide future oral health interventions for people with mental disorders at both the policy and practice level. Using a five-step process, that incorporates primary data collection from key stakeholders, a beginning theoretical framework will be developed to describe contextual and mechanistic factors and how they might impact on the success or failure of oral health interventions for people with mental disorders. Key database searches will be conducted, with data extraction focused on the factors that might have impacted on intervention implementation and outcomes. Quality appraisal of studies will occur, and the theoretical framework will be populated with extracted data. Stakeholder input will support the development and refinement of a theory on oral health interventions for people with mental disorders. Discussion This will be the first review to take a realist approach to explore the broad scope of causal factors that impact on the success or failure of oral health interventions for people with mental disorders. The approach includes extensive stakeholder engagement and will advance realist systematic review methodology. Review outcomes will be important in guiding policy and practice to ensure oral health interventions better meet the needs of people with mental disorders.Systematic review registration This review protocol is registered with PROSPERO (Number) 155969.

Thromboembolic complications of endovenous thermal ablation and foam sclerotherapy in the treatment of great saphenous vein insufficiency.

OBJECTIVE We assessed the incidence of venous thromboembolism following treatment of great saphenous insufficiency by endovenous thermal ablation or foam sclerotherapy using meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials and case series. METHODS Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and Clinical Trials Registry databases were searched from January 2000 through January 2013 for randomized controlled trials and large case series employing endovenous thermal ablation or foam sclerotherapy as a single modality for the treatment of great saphenous insufficiency, with concomitant postoperative duplex scanning. Pooled (stratified) incidence of venous thromboembolism with 95% confidence intervals was estimated using the DerSimonian–Laird procedure for random effects meta-analysis. A bootstrap analysis was performed to examine between-modality differences. RESULTS Twelve randomized controlled trials and 19 case series investigating endovenous thermal ablation (radio frequency ablation with VNUS/Covidien ClosureFAST™ catheter only, endovenous laser ablation, or both) were included. Data from 12 randomized controlled trials and 6 case series investigating nonproprietary foam preparations were analyzed. Estimated incidence of venous thromboembolism was low (mostly <1%) and similar across treatment modalities and study types. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of great saphenous insufficiency by endovenous thermal ablation or foam sclerotherapy is a common vascular intervention. The stratified incidence of venous thromboembolism appears to be low as reported in both randomized controlled trials and case series investigating these modalities. Although duplex scans were obtained postoperatively, a minority of studies specified protocols for venous thromboembolism detection.

Comparison of the single-use Ambu(®) aScope™ 2 vs the conventional fibrescope for tracheal intubation in patients with cervical spine immobilisation by a semirigid collar*.

Fibreoptic intubation remains a key technique for the management of difficult intubation. We randomly compared the second generation single-use Ambu(®) aScope™ 2 videoscope with a standard re-usable flexible intubating fibrescope in 50 tracheal intubations in patients with a difficult airway simulated by a semirigid collar. All patients' tracheas were intubated successfully with the aScope 2 or the re-usable fibrescope. The median (IQR [range]) time to intubate was significantly longer with the aScope 2 70 (55-97 [41?-226]) s vs 50 (40-59 [27-175]) s, p = 0.0003) due to an increased time to see the carina. Quality of vision was significantly lower with the aScope 2 (excellent 24 (48%) vs 49 (98%), p = 0.0001; good 22 (44%) vs 1 (2%), p = 0.0001; poor 4 (8%) vs 0, p = 0.12) but with no difference in the subjective ease to intubate (easy score of 31 (62%) vs 38 (76%), p = 0.19; intermediate 12 (24%) vs 7 (14%), p = 0.31; difficult 7 (14%) vs 5 (5%), p = 0.76). The longer times to intubate and the poorer scores for quality of vision do not support the use of the single-use aScope 2 videoscope as an alternative to the re-usable fibrescope.

Evaluation of the Relationship Between Age and Trabecular Meshwork Height to Predict the Risk of Glaucoma.

This study evaluated age-related trabecular meshwork (TM) height variations in the eyes of adults in different age groups. We hypothesised that a reduction in TM occurs with increasing age. This retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study was conducted at Yonsei University Gangnam Severance Hospital between January 2015 and June 2019. We randomly included 250 eyes of 125 patients who underwent anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). The distance from the scleral spur to Schwalbe's line in patients with normal open anterior chamber angle was measured using AS-OCT. Results were stratified based on patients' age group-≤40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, and 81-92 years. Thereafter, the results were compared among the age groups. The mean TM height of the patients was 770.929 ± 76.776 μm. TM height was 853.188 ± 94.117 μm in patients aged ≤40 years; it was 815.309 ± 75.723, 798.115 ± 66.040, 770.942 ± 52.774, 726.716 ± 63.979, and 715.968 ± 63.403 μm in patients aged 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, and 81-92 years, respectively. The TM height tended to decrease with increasing age (P < 0.001). TM height was significantly shorter in older patients than in younger ones. Therefore, TM height may change with age and may contribute to increased glaucoma risk and prevalence.

Complication of the use of a radiofrequency device in arthroscopic shoulder surgery: second-degree burn of the shoulder girdle.

Radiofrequency ablation (RF) energy devices are increasingly being used in arthroscopic surgery. This is a case report of a 53-year-old man who had second-degree burns of the shoulder and chest wall as a result of fluid overheating due to RF. During an extensive arthroscopic bursal dissection of the left shoulder, the suction device on the RF wand and the valve was left open, allowing fluid to drip onto the chest and arm of the patient. Three days after his surgery, on his first postoperative visit, the dressings were removed, and the patient was noted to have severe blistering on the lateral aspect of his arm and on the anterolateral aspect of his left chest wall. One year after the surgery, he still had residual scarring that was only mildly intermittently pruritic. The use of RF during arthroscopic surgery is very useful clinically; however, it is important to have a strict understanding of the potential hazards the thermal energy can cause to the surrounding soft tissue.

One-step fluorescence photoacoustic tomography with the optical radiative transfer model.

We present adjoint-based Jacobian as well as gradient evaluations and corresponding reconstruction schemes to solve the fully nonlinear, optical radiative transfer modeled one-step fluorescence photoacoustic tomographic (FPAT) problem, which aims to reconstruct the map of absorption coefficient of the exogenous fluorophore from boundary photoacoustic data. The radiative transport equation (RTE) and frequency-domain photoacoustic equation have been employed to model light and photoacoustic wave propagation, respectively. Levenberg-Marquardt and Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno reconstruction schemes have been used corresponding to the evaluated Jacobians and gradients, respectively. Numerical reconstructions obtained from the two schemes have been validated for scattering-dominant as well as nonscattering-dominant media in 2D. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first one-step FPAT reconstruction results in literature based on the optical RTE model.

Bat severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus ORF3b homologues display different interferon antagonist activities.

The ORF3b protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at its C terminus and antagonizes interferon (IFN) function by modulating the activity of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) found in bats share an identical genome organization and high sequence identity for most of their gene products. In this study, ORF3b homologues were identified from three bat SL-CoV strains. These ORF3b homologues were C-terminally truncated and lacked the C-terminal NLS of SARS-CoV. IFN antagonist activities analysis demonstrated that one SL-CoV ORF3b still possessed IFN antagonist and IRF3-modulating activities. These results indicate that different ORF3b proteins display different IFN antagonist activities and this function is independent of the protein's nuclear localization, suggesting a potential link between bat SL-CoV ORF3b function and viral pathogenesis.

Neuroendocrine tumors of the bronchopulmonary system (typical and atypical carcinoid tumors): current strategies in diagnosis and treatment. Conclusions of an expert meeting February 2011 in Weimar, Germany.

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs; syn. carcinoid tumors) are highly or moderately differentiated neoplasms. They comprise a large variety of rare and heterogeneous tumors with an estimated incidence of 3-5/100,000/year. They can arise in virtually every internal organ, but mainly occur in the gastroenteropancreatic and bronchopulmonary systems. Around 25% of the NETs are localized in the bronchopulmonary system. Approximately 2% of all lung tumors are NETs. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lung tumors, bronchopulmonary NETs are subdivided into typical carcinoids (TCs) and atypical carcinoids (ACs). The parameter with the highest impact on NET behavior and prognosis is the histological classification and staging according to the tumor/node/metastasis (TNM) system. The diagnosis of NETs is established by histological examination and the immunohistochemical detection of general neuroendocrine markers, such as chromogranin A (CgA) and synaptophysin. Serum markers and the use of functional imaging techniques are important additive tools to establish the diagnosis of a NET. The only curative option for lung NETs is complete surgical resection. Beyond that, the currently available interdisciplinary therapeutic options are local ablation, biotherapy (somatostatin analogues), or chemotherapy. New therapeutic options such as peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and molecularly targeted therapies achieve promising results and are under further evaluation. This report is a consensus summary of the interdisciplinary symposium 'Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Lung and of the Gastroenteropancreatic System (GEP NET) - Expert Dialogue' held on February 25-26, 2011 in Weimar, Germany. At this conference, a panel of 23 German experts shared their knowledge and exchanged their thoughts about research, diagnosis, and clinical management of NETs, whereby special attention was paid to NETs of the respiratory tract.

Cell Attachment Domains of the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Spike Protein Are Key Targets of Neutralizing Antibodies.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes enteric disease in pigs, resulting in significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Current vaccination approaches against this emerging coronavirus are only partially effective, though natural infection protects pigs against reinfection and provides lactogenic immunity to suckling piglets. The viral spike (S) glycoprotein, responsible for receptor binding and cell entry, is the major target for neutralizing antibodies. However, knowledge of antibody epitopes, their nature and location in the spike structure, and the mechanisms by which the antibodies interfere with infection is scarce. Here we describe the generation and characterization of 10 neutralizing and nonneutralizing mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against the S1 receptor binding subunit of the S protein. By expression of different S1 protein fragments, six antibody epitope classes distributed over the five structural domains of the S1 subunit were identified. Characterization of antibodies for cross-reactivity and cross-neutralization revealed antigenic differences among PEDV strains. The epitopes of potent neutralizing antibodies segregated into two epitope classes and mapped within the N-terminal sialic acid binding domain and in the more C-terminal receptor binding domain. Antibody neutralization escape mutants displayed single amino acid substitutions that impaired antibody binding and neutralization and defined the locations of the epitopes. Our observations picture the antibody epitope landscape of the PEDV S1 subunit and reveal that its cell attachment domains are key targets of neutralizing antibodies.IMPORTANCE Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an emerging porcine coronavirus, causes an economically important enteric disease in pigs. Effective PEDV vaccines for disease control are currently lacking. The spike (S) glycoprotein on the virion surface is the key player in virus cell entry and, therefore, the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the antigenic landscape of the PEDV spike protein, we developed monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein's S1 receptor binding region and characterized their epitopes, neutralizing activity, and cross-reactivity toward multiple PEDV strains. Epitopes of antibodies segregated into six epitope classes dispersed over the multidomain S1 structure. Monoclonal antibodies revealed antigenic variability in B-cell epitopes between PEDV strains. The epitopes of neutralizing antibodies mapped to two distinct domains in S1 that are involved in binding to carbohydrate and proteinaceous cell surface molecules, respectively, indicating the importance of these cell attachment sites on the PEDV spike protein in eliciting a protective humoral immune response.

Transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis at low and intermediate risk: systematic review and meta-analysis.

OBJECTIVE To examine the effect of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) versus surgical replacement of an aortic valve (SAVR) in patients with severe aortic stenosis at low and intermediate risk of perioperative death. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL. STUDY SELECTION Randomized trials of TAVI compared with SAVR in patients with a mean perioperative risk of death <8%. REVIEW METHODS Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for outcomes important to patients that were selected a priori by a parallel guideline committee, including patient advisors. We used the GRADE system was used to quantify absolute effects and quality of evidence. RESULTS 4 trials with 3179 patients and a median follow-up of two years were included. Compared with SAVR, transfemoral TAVI was associated with reduced mortality (risk difference per 1000 patients: -30, 95% confidence interval -49 to -8, moderate certainty), stroke (-20, -37 to 1, moderate certainty), life threatening bleeding (-252, -293 to -190, high certainty), atrial fibrillation (-178, -150 to -203, moderate certainty), and acute kidney injury (-53, -39 to -62, high certainty) but increased short term aortic valve reintervention (7, 1 to 21, moderate certainty), permanent pacemaker insertion (134, 16 to 382, moderate certainty), and moderate or severe symptoms of heart failure (18, 5 to 34, moderate certainty). Compared with SAVR, transapical TAVI was associated higher mortality (57, -16 to 153, moderate certainty, P=0.015 for interaction between transfemoral versus transapical TAVI) and stroke (45, -2 to 125, moderate certainty, interaction P=0.012). No study reported long term follow-up, which is particularly important for structural valve deterioration. CONCLUSIONS Many patients, particularly those who have a shorter life expectancy or place a lower value on the risk of long term valve degeneration, are likely to perceive net benefit with transfemoral TAVI versus SAVR. SAVR, however, performs better than transapical TAVI, which is of interest to patients who are not candidates for transfemoral TAVI. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION PROSPERO CRD42016042879.

Tumor invasion in draining lymph nodes is associated with Treg accumulation in breast cancer patients.

Tumor-draining lymph node (TDLN) invasion by metastatic cells in breast cancer correlates with poor prognosis and is associated with local immunosuppression, which can be partly mediated by regulatory T cells (Tregs). Here, we study Tregs from matched tumor-invaded and non-invaded TDLNs, and breast tumors. We observe that Treg frequencies increase with nodal invasion, and that Tregs express higher levels of co-inhibitory/stimulatory receptors than effector cells. Also, while Tregs show conserved suppressive function in TDLN and tumor, conventional T cells (Tconvs) in TDLNs proliferate and produce Th1-inflammatory cytokines, but are dysfunctional in the tumor. We describe a common transcriptomic signature shared by Tregs from tumors and nodes, including CD80, which is significantly associated with poor patient survival. TCR RNA-sequencing analysis indicates trafficking between TDLNs and tumors and ongoing Tconv/Treg conversion. Overall, TDLN Tregs are functional and express a distinct pattern of druggable co-receptors, highlighting their potential as targets for cancer immunotherapy.

Nanomagnetic System for Rapid Diagnosis of Acute Infection.

Pathogen-activated antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) produce and secrete antigen-specific antibodies. ASCs are detectable in the peripheral blood as early as 3 days after antigen exposure, which makes ASCs a potential biomarker for early disease detection. Here, we present a magnetic capture and detection (MCD) assay for sensitive, on-site detection of ASCs. In this approach, ASCs are enriched through magnetic capture, and secreted antibodies are magnetically detected by a miniaturized nuclear magnetic resonance (μNMR) system. This approach is based entirely on magnetics, which supports high contrast against biological background and simplifies assay procedures. We advanced the MCD system by (i) synthesizing magnetic nanoparticles with high magnetic moments for both cell capture and antibody detection, (ii) developing a miniaturized magnetic device for high-yield cell capture, and (iii) optimizing the μNMR assay for antibody detection. Antibody responses targeting hemolysin E (HlyE) can accurately identify individuals with acute enteric fever. As a proof-of-concept, we applied MCD to detect antibodies produced by HlyE-specific hybridoma cells. The MCD achieved high sensitivity in detecting antibodies secreted from as few as 5 hybridoma cells (50 cells/mL). Importantly, the assay could be performed with whole blood with minimal sample processing.

Maternal health care management during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel type of highly contagious pneumonia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite the strong efforts taken to control the epidemic, hundreds of thousands of people were infected worldwide by Mar. 11th , and was characterized as a pandemic by World Health Organization. Pregnant women are more susceptible to the virus due to immune and anatomic alteration, though hospital visits may increase the chance of infection, the lack of medical care during pregnancy may do more harm. Hence, a well-managed system that allows pregnant women to access maternal health care with minimum exposure risk is desired during the outbreak. Here, we present the managing processes of three pregnant women that had a fever during hospitalization at gynecology or obstetrics department, then further summarize and demonstrate our maternal health care management strategies including antenatal care planning, patient triage based on risk level, admission control, and measures counteracting emergencies and newly discovered high risk cases at in-patient department. In the meantime, we will explain the alterations we have done throughout different stages of the epidemic, and also review relative articles in both Chinese and English to compare our strategies with those of other areas. Although tens of COVID-19 cases were confirmed in our hospital, no nosocomial infection has occurred and none of the pregnant woman registered in our hospital was reported to be infected.

Network pharmacology and molecular docking analysis on molecular targets and mechanisms of Huashi Baidu formula in the treatment of COVID-19.

PURPOSE Huashi Baidu formula (HSBDF) was developed to treat the patients with severe COVID-19 in China. The purpose of this study was to explore its active compounds and demonstrate its mechanisms against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through network pharmacology and molecular docking. METHODS All the components of HSBDF were retrieved from the pharmacology database of TCM system. The genes corresponding to the targets were retrieved using UniProt and GeneCards database. The herb-compound-target network was constructed by Cytoscape. The target protein-protein interaction network was built using STRING database. The core targets of HSBDF were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The main active compounds of HSBDF were docked with SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). RESULTS Compound-target network mainly contained 178 compounds and 272 corresponding targets. Key targets contained MAPK3, MAPK8, TP53, CASP3, IL6, TNF, MAPK1, CCL2, PTGS2, etc. There were 522 GO items in GO enrichment analysis (p < .05) and 168 signaling pathways (p < .05) in KEGG, mainly including TNF signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and HIF-1 signaling pathway. The results of molecular docking showed that baicalein and quercetin were the top two compounds of HSBDF, which had high affinity with ACE2. CONCLUSION Baicalein and quercetin in HSBDF may regulate multiple signaling pathways through ACE2, which might play a therapeutic role on COVID-19.

Robotic laparoendoscopic single-site radical nephrectomy: surgical technique and comparative outcomes.

BACKGROUND Recent reports have suggested that robotic laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (R-LESS) is feasible, yet comparative studies to conventional laparoscopy are lacking. OBJECTIVE To report our early experience with R-LESS radical nephrectomy (RN). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective review of R-LESS RN data was performed between May 2008 and November 2010. A total of 10 procedures were performed and subsequently matched to 10 conventional laparoscopic RN procedures (controls). The control group was matched with respect to patient age, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologists score, surgical indication, and tumor size. SURGICAL PROCEDURE R-LESS RN was performed using methods outlined in the manuscript and supplemental video material. All patients underwent R-LESS RN by a single surgeon. Single-port access was achieved via two commercially available multichannel ports, and robotic trocars were inserted either through separate fascial stabs or through the port, depending on the type used. The da Vinci S and da Vinci-Si Surgical Systems (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with pediatric and standard instruments were used. MEASUREMENTS Preoperative, perioperative, pathologic, and functional outcomes data were analyzed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The mean patient age was 64.0 yr of age for both groups, and BMI was 29.2 kg/m(2). There was no difference between R-LESS and conventional laparoscopy cases in median operative time, estimated blood loss, visual analogue scale, or complication rate. The R-LESS group had a lower median narcotic requirement during hospital admission (25.3 morphine equivalents vs 37.5 morphine equivalents; p=0.049) and a shorter length of stay (2.5 d vs 3.0 d; p=0.03). Study limitations include the small sample size, short follow-up period, and all the inherent biases introduced by a retrospective study design. CONCLUSIONS R-LESS RN offers comparable perioperative outcomes to conventional laparoscopic RN. Prospective comparison is needed to definitively establish the position of R-LESS in minimally invasive urologic surgery.

Cervical lymph node diseases in children.

The lymph nodes are an essential part of the body's immune system and as such are affected in many infectious, autoimmune, metabolic and malignant diseases. The cervical lymph nodes are particularly important because they are the first drainage stations for key points of contact with the outside world (mouth/throat/nose/eyes/ears/respiratory system) - a critical aspect especially among children - and can represent an early clinical sign in their exposed position on a child's slim neck. Involvement of the lymph nodes in multiple conditions is accompanied by a correspondingly large number of available diagnostic procedures. In the interests of time, patient wellbeing and cost, a careful choice of these must be made to permit appropriate treatment. The basis of diagnostic decisions is a detailed anamnesis and clinical examination. Sonography also plays an important role in differential diagnosis of lymph node swelling in children and is useful in answering one of the critical diagnostic questions: is there a suspicion of malignancy? If so, full dissection of the most conspicuous lymph node may be necessary to obtain histological confirmation. Diagnosis and treatment of childhood cervical lymph node disorders present the attending pediatric and ENT physicians with some particular challenges. The spectrum of differential diagnoses and the varying degrees of clinical relevance - from banal infections to malignant diseases - demand a clear and considered approach to the child's individual clinical presentation. Such an approach is described in the following paper.

Transvaginal natural-orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) in adnexal procedures.

From August 2010 to June 2011, 10 consecutive patients underwent transvaginal NOTES of the adnexa, including tubal sterilization in 3, salpingectomy because of ectopic pregnancy in 3, and ovarian tumor enucleation in 4. The mean (SD; 95% CI) age of the patients was 34.8 (9.7; 27.9-41.8) years, and their body mass index was 21.6 (2.8; 19.4-23.8). In 9 of the 10 patients, the procedure was completed. The 3 tubal sterilization procedures were completed in 18 to 30 minutes, with negligible blood loss. Operative time for the 3 salpingectomies because of ectopic pregnancy was 62 to 116 minutes. One of these procedures included management of 2000 mL hemoperitoneum. Three of the 4 attempts at ovarian enucleation were successfully completed within 64 to 162 minutes, with estimated blood loss ≤ 50 mL. One NOTES procedure failed because of a misdiagnosed peritoneal mucinous tumor located anterior to the uterus and inaccessible, leading to subsequent conversion to transabdominal laparoscopy. Our preliminary results show that purely transvaginal NOTES is feasible and safe for use in performing uterine adnexal procedures in selected patients. However, the procedure cannot be used in patients with cul-de-sac disease, and could have limited use in treating lesions located anterior to the uterus.

Development of a sensitive immunochromatographic method using lanthanide fluorescent microsphere for rapid serodiagnosis of COVID-19.

The SARS-CoV-2 infection that caused the COVID-19 pandemic quickly spread worldwide within two months. Rapid diagnosis of the disease and isolation of patients is an effective way to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, a sensitive immunofluorescent assay method was developed for rapid detection of special IgM and IgG of COVID-19 in human serum within 10 mins. The recombinant nucleocapsid protein of 2019 novel coronavirus was used as capture antigen. Lanthanide, Eu(III) fluorescent microsphere was used to qualitative/semi-quantitative determine the solid phase immunochromatographic assay. A total of 28 clinical positive and 77 negative serum or plasma samples were included in the test. Based on the analysis of serum or plasma from COVID-19 patients and healthy peoples, the sensitivity and specificity of the immunochromatographic assay were calculated as 98.72% and 100% (IgG); 98.68% and 93.10% (IgM), respectively. The results demonstrated that rapid immunoassay has high sensitivity and specificity and was useful for rapid serodiagnosis of COVID-19.

Should enteral nutrition be started in the first week of critical illness?

PURPOSE OF REVIEW To review the mechanistic evidence for early enteral nutrition in critically ill patients within the first week of ICU admission. RECENT FINDINGS There is a lack of recent large randomized controlled trials showing clinically important outcome benefits related to early enteral nutrition. Most supporting studies are based on the animal models, and explore mechanisms of benefit related to gut immunity and oxidative stress. In addition, the impact of nutrient deprivation on the microbiome recently shown in a human trial is compelling. Large randomized controlled clinical trials have emerged in the last 2 years, however, comparing minimal enteral nutrition therapy and enteral nutrition versus parenteral nutrition. They call into question the low quality of clinical evidence and the widespread support for early enteral nutrition as a primary recommendation. As a result, the questions of whether or not enteral nutrition should be initiated in the first week versus standard of care or parenteral nutrition and how clinicians justify this recommendation are raised. SUMMARY Despite the wide range of quality in the current clinical outcomes evidence, early enteral nutrition within the first week of ICU admission, delivered to the appropriate patient, promotes gut-mediated immunity, lowers metabolic response to stress, maintains microbial diversity, and improves clinical outcomes versus standard of care or parenteral nutrition therapy.

The Effect of Standardizing Autologous Prime Techniques in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery with Cardiopulmonary Bypass.

Autologous priming (AP) of the extracorporeal circuit has been used as a technique to reduce iatrogenic anemia in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The purpose of this study was to review the results of standardizing AP techniques to reduce variation among clinicians and its effect on clinical outcomes. Standardized goal-directed protocols for AP were established by the cardiac team and applied to all adult cardiac surgical patients where CPB was used. Following Institutional Review Board approval, data were analyzed for two sequential groups of patients: Non-standardized AP (NST-AP) and standardized AP (ST-AP). Exclusion criteria included pre-CPB hemodynamic instability and preoperative hematocrit (Hct) values less than 30%. The primary end point was the transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs), whereas secondary end points included Hct change and other perioperative allogeneic blood product transfusions. Data are presented as mean and SD. Of the 192 patients evaluated, 82 were in the NST-AP group and 110 in the ST-AP group. There were no preoperative demographic differences across groups. Total AP volume was lower in the NST-AP group than in the ST-AP patients (486.8 ± 259.6 mL vs. 1,048.2 ± 218.7 mL, p < .001). Whereas pre-CPB Hct values were identical between the groups, the first on-CPB (25.7% ± 4.5% vs. 27.9% ± 4.2%, p < .001), high CPB (27.7% ± 3.5% vs. 29.1% ± 3.6%, p < .008), and first postoperative (32.5% ± 4.0% vs. 34.3% ± 3.9%, p < .003) were all significantly higher in ST-AP patients. Perioperative transfusion rate was higher in NST-AP patients (63.6%) vs. ST-AP (44.6%), p < .01. There was no difference in intraoperative RBC transfusion, but postoperatively, more patients in the NST-AP group received RBCs than those in the ST-AP group (51.2% vs. 28.2%, p < .01). The application of an ST-AP protocol was effective in reducing hemodilution, which was associated within higher Hcts and lower postoperative transfusion rates.

Reliability and validity of the Symptoms of Depression Questionnaire (SDQ).

Current measures for major depressive disorder focus primarily on the assessment of depressive symptoms, while often omitting other common features. However, the presence of comorbid features in the anxiety spectrum influences outcome and may effect treatment. More comprehensive measures of depression are needed that include the assessment of symptoms in the anxiety-depression spectrum. This study examines the reliability and validity of the Symptoms of Depression Questionnaire (SDQ), which assesses irritability, anger attacks, and anxiety symptoms together with the commonly considered symptoms of depression. Analysis of the factor structure of the SDQ identified 5 subscales, including one in the anxiety-depression spectrum, with adequate internal consistency and concurrent validity. The SDQ may be a valuable new tool to better characterize depression and identify and administer more targeted interventions.

Influence of macrocyclic chelators on the targeting properties of (68)Ga-labeled synthetic affibody molecules: comparison with (111)In-labeled counterparts.

Affibody molecules are a class of small (7 kDa) non-immunoglobulin scaffold-based affinity proteins, which have demonstrated substantial potential as probes for radionuclide molecular imaging. The use of positron emission tomography (PET) would further increase the resolution and quantification accuracy of Affibody-based imaging. The rapid in vivo kinetics of Affibody molecules permit the use of the generator-produced radionuclide (68)Ga (T1/2=67.6 min). Earlier studies have demonstrated that the chemical nature of chelators has a substantial influence on the biodistribution properties of Affibody molecules. To determine an optimal labeling approach, the macrocyclic chelators 1,4,7,10-tetraazacylododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-N,N,N-triacetic acid (NOTA) and 1-(1,3-carboxypropyl)-1,4,7- triazacyclononane-4,7-diacetic acid (NODAGA) were conjugated to the N-terminus of the synthetic Affibody molecule ZHER2:S1 targeting HER2. Affibody molecules were labeled with (68)Ga, and their binding specificity and cellular processing were evaluated. The biodistribution of (68)Ga-DOTA-ZHER2:S1, (68)Ga-NOTA-ZHER2:S1 and (68)Ga-NODAGA-ZHER2:S1, as well as that of their (111)In-labeled counterparts, was evaluated in BALB/C nu/nu mice bearing HER2-expressing SKOV3 xenografts. The tumor uptake for (68)Ga-DOTA-ZHER2:S1 (17.9 ± 0.7%IA/g) was significantly higher than for both (68)Ga-NODAGA-ZHER2:S1 (16.13 ± 0.67%IA/g) and (68)Ga-NOTA-ZHER2:S1 (13 ± 3%IA/g) at 2 h after injection. (68)Ga-NODAGA-ZHER2:S1 had the highest tumor-to-blood ratio (60 ± 10) in comparison with both (68)Ga-DOTA-ZHER2:S1 (28 ± 4) and (68)Ga-NOTA-ZHER2:S1 (42 ± 11). The tumor-to-liver ratio was also higher for (68)Ga-NODAGA-ZHER2:S1 (7 ± 2) than the DOTA and NOTA conjugates (5.5 ± 0.6 vs.3.3 ± 0.6). The influence of chelator on the biodistribution and targeting properties was less pronounced for (68)Ga than for (111)In. The results of this study demonstrate that macrocyclic chelators conjugated to the N-terminus have a substantial influence on the biodistribution of HER2-targeting Affibody molecules labeled with (68)Ga.This can be utilized to enhance the imaging contrast of PET imaging using Affibody molecules and improve the sensitivity of molecular imaging. The study demonstrated an appreciable difference of chelator influence for (68)Ga and (111)In.

Laparoscopic appendectomy with a single incision in a single institute.

PURPOSE The laparoscopic appendectomy has become popular for the treatment of acute appendicitis. A single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy offers better cosmesis. We present the results of single-incision laparoscopic appendectomies in our hospital as initial experience. METHODS A single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy was performed in 75 patients at The Catholic University of Korea, Bucheon St. Mary's hospital. The operating time, operation type, hospital stay, surgical morbidities, and body mass index were compared. RESULTS This retrospective study revealed equal operation times in both the suppurative and the perforated appendicitis group. There was an increase in the hospital stay in the perforated appendicitis group. The postoperative complication rate was 4%, and the median operation time was 58.55 ± 31.79 minutes. CONCLUSION The single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy was easy and safe procedure for treating acute appendicitis. There were no differences in degree of inflammation and body mass index.

The Use of Catheter Mount Will Result in More Reliable Carbon Dioxide Monitoring under Fluid Exposing Conditions.

Introduction Capnometer can be readily malfunctioned by fluid exposure during treatment of critically ill patients. This study aimed to determine whether placing capnometer distant from the endotracheal tube by connecting direct connect catheter mount (DCCM) is effective in yielding reliable end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) by reducing capnometer malfunctioning caused by water exposure. Methods In 25 healthy adults, a prospective, open label, crossover study was conducted to examine the effect of DCCM in mainstream and microstream capnometers under water exposing conditions. The primary endpoint was the comparison of ETCO2 between proximal DCCM (pDCCM) and distal DCCM (dDCCM). Results For mainstream capnometers, mean ETCO2 was significantly (p < 0.001) higher in dDCCM compared to pDCCM under water exposing conditions (29.5 vs. 19.0 with 5 ml; 33.8 vs. 21.2 with 10 ml; mmHg). Likewise, for microstream capnometers, ETCO2 was greatly higher (p < 0.001) in dDCCM compared to pDCCM (30.5 vs. 13.9 with 5 ml; 29.9 vs.11.4 with 10 mL; mmHg). ETCO2 measured by dDCCM was reliable in microstream settings, whereas it was unreliable in mainstream (correlation coefficient 0.88 vs. 0.27). Conclusions Application of DCCM onto the capnometer setting seems to be effective in reducing capnometer malfunctioning under fluid exposing conditions, which is obvious in microstream capnometer by producing more reliable ETCO2.

Successful application of laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) for a lateral-spreading mucosal gastric cancer.

In the current era of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for early gastric cancer, which carries a negligible risk of lymph node metastasis, local resection of the stomach remains an option for these lesions. This is particularly so for a large intramucosal lesion or a lesion with a strong ulcer scar, for which ESD becomes a difficult option. Here, we describe a case of lateral-spreading intramucosal gastric cancer of 6-cm diameter located at the fornix of the stomach, which was successfully treated by laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) because of the expected risk of complications during ESD. In the LECS procedure, the resection margin was appropriately determined by the endoscopic evaluation in detail and by the ESD technique. If early gastric cancer fits the criteria for endoscopic resection but would present difficulty if performing ESD, this is a good indication for the LECS procedure.

Does the gravity orientation of saccular aneurysms influence hemodynamics? An experimental study with and without flow diverter stent.

Most intracranial aneurysms morphologic studies focused on characterization of size, location, aspect ratio, relationship to the surrounding vasculature and hemodynamics. However, the spatial orientation with respect to the gravity direction has not been taken into account although it could trigger various hemodynamic conditions. The present work addresses this possibility. It was divided in two parts: 1) the orientations of 18, 3D time-of-flight MRI (3D TOF MRI), scans of saccular aneurysms were analyzed. This investigation suggested that there was no privileged orientation for cerebral aneurysms. The aneurysms were oriented in the brain as follows: 9 - down, 9 - up; 11 - right, 7 - left; 6 - front, 12 - back. 2) Based on these results, subsidiary in vitro experiments were performed, analyzing the behavior of red blood cells (RBCs) within a silicone model of aneurysm before and after flow diverter stent (FDS) deployment in the parent vessel. These experiments used a test bench that reproduces physiological pulsatile flow conditions for two orientations: an aneurysm sack pointing either up (opposite to gravitational force) and down (along the gravitational force). The results showed that the orientation of an aneurysm significantly affects the intra-aneurysmal RBCs behavior after stenting, and therefore that gravity can affect the intra-aneurysm behavior of RBCs. This suggests that the patient׳s aneurysm orientation could impact the outcome of the FDS treatment. The implementation of this effect in patient-specific numerical and preoperative decision support techniques could contribute to better understand the intrasaccular biological and hemodynamic events induced by FDS.

ELEVATED MONOCYTE DISTRIBUTION WIDTH IN COVID-19 PATIENTS: THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE NOVEL SEPSIS INDICATOR.

INTRODUCTION Interesting results regarding the contribution of MDW (Monocyte Distribution Width) in the Infectious Disease Unit have been reported. An observational study is ongoing at San Donato Hospital with the aim to evaluate the contribution of MDW in the diagnostic pathway in adult patients entering in the ED setting and tested for SARS-CoV-2. MATERIAL AND METHOD COVID-19 symptomatic and paucisymptomatic patients presenting to ED (Emergency Department), have been enrolled consecutively. Whole blood venous samples have been collected on K2 EDTA for MDW determination, at the same time a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection have been collected. RESULTS One hundred six patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2 with MDW mean value of 20.3 ± 3.3, while forty-one were positive for SARS-CoV-2 with higher MDW mean value of 27.3 ± 4.9 (P <0.005). The ROC curve analysis has been evaluated showing MDW AUC of 0.91. Finally twenty-three patients hospitalized in high-intensity care unit showed an MDW value higher than the eighteen patients presenting few symptoms [28.8 ± 5.3 vs 25.4 ± 3.6 respectively, P<0.05]. DISCUSSION Monocytic population, in Covid19 disease, are the first elements of innate immunity to be involved, these changes are the basis of the modification of the MDW, with evident efficacy in term of sensitivity, particularly in the studied Covid19 patients. Moreover the patients hospitalized in high-intensity care unit showed significantly elevated MDW respects to middle or low symptomatic one, suggest including this parameter as prognostic marker or of therapy efficacy, integrated with other laboratory findings.

Surgical Efficacy Among Laparoscopic Ultrasonic Dissectors: Are We Advancing Safely? A Review of Literature.

The specialty of laparoscopy has evolved with the advent of new technologies over the last few years. Energy-based devices and Ultrasonic dissectors are used with a lot of factors in play-including ergonomics and economics during surgery. Here an attempt is based to review the surgical efficacy and safety of these dissectors with importance to plume production and lateral thermal damage. The factors contributing to adversities to the dissectors are also to be noted. The strategy adopted was aimed at finding relevant studies from PubMed from 1995 to 2014. The basic principle of plume production and thermal damage are studied in this review. Factors contributing to the same that can lead to adversities during laparoscopic surgeries are identified. Summarizing key points that increase lateral thermal damage and plume production amongst different ultrasonic shears and suggesting a technique to identify the right balance between the existing dissectors was possible. The RF Device and USS are both useful and widely used and are more safer than monopolar devices. RF Device is considerably slower than USS, as it cannot achieve coagulation and cutting at the same time. Although USS definitely improvises dissection and has less thermal injury than RF Device, the clinical implications in balancing dissection efficacy with hemostasis need to be investigated further. The ideal haemostatic energy-based shear device would be one with excellent hemostatic results and visual acuity while allowing none or minimal thermal energy escape at the point of application. In our current setting, a combined use of both RF and USS device usage as applied in the particular situations has potential.

The First Report of Laparoscopic Multivisceral Resection for a Gastrocolic Fistula Secondary to Colon Cancer.

BACKGROUND Colon cancer rarely presents with a gastrocolic fistula and resection, if feasible, is usually carried out by open surgery. The authors present the first literature case report of laparoscopic multivisceral resection for gastrocolic fistula secondary to locally advanced colon cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS A 54-year-old man presented with feculant vomiting, cachexia, and severe iron deficiency anemia. Investigations confirmed a large nonmetastatic splenic flexure colon cancer with fistulation into the stomach. After 10 weeks of nutritional support and laparoscopic defunctioning proximal transverse loop colostomy, we proceeded to laparoscopic extended left hemicolectomy with en bloc sleeve gastrectomy and partial splenectomy. RESULT The procedure was completed laparoscopically (operating time, 400 min; blood loss, 150 mL). He was discharged on the 6th postoperative day after an uneventful recovery. Histology showed an R0 resection of a pT4N1a (1/45 lymph nodes involved) colon cancer with gastrocolic fistula. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic multivisceral en bloc R0 resection of locally advanced colon cancer with gastrocolic fistula can be accomplished safely in experienced hands.

Efficacy of forced-air warming for preventing perioperative hypothermia and related complications in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery: A randomized controlled trial.

BACKGROUND Perioperatively, unexpected hypothermia may cause adverse surgical outcomes. However, few studies have explored the efficacy of forced-air warming in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. AIM/OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy of forced-air warming for preventing perioperative hypothermia and complications in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. METHODS A total of 127 participants undergoing laparoscopic thoracic or abdominal surgery were recruited between January and November 2015. Participants were randomly allocated to intervention (forced-air warming, n = 64) and control groups (passive insulation, n = 63). Oesophageal core temperature was measured during surgery, whilst tympanic core temperature was measured every 30 minutes preoperatively and in the postanaesthesia care unit. Levels of shivering and pain, amount of bleeding, and adverse cardiac events were measured before the transfer from the postanaesthesia care unit. The generalized estimating equation was used for data analysis. RESULTS The intervention group had better warming efficacy than the control group between 90 and 330 minutes during surgery. The intervention group had fewer complications than the control group in terms of intraoperative bleeding, time to rewarm to 36°C, pain levels, and shivering levels in the postanaesthesia care unit. CONCLUSION Forced-air warming can increase warming efficacy and reduce complications of perioperative hypothermia in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery.

Laparoscopic transperitoneal pyeloplasty.

Laparoscopic pyeloplasty is a first-line option for the management of ureteropelvic junction obstruction. It has a greater success rate than endopyelotomy and is associated with a shorter and less intense convalescence than open surgical pyeloplasty. The technique is well established and reproducible, although the procedure is more difficult in certain situations, such as after a previous pyeloplasty. Because laparoscopic suturing is needed, it is considered an advanced laparoscopic procedure. Suturing devices can facilitate suturing, but they are not optimal for all repairs. This article and the accompanying video summarize the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative considerations for laparoscopic pyeloplasty.

Limited amounts of dendritic cells migrate into the T-cell area of lymph nodes but have high immune activating potential in melanoma patients.

PURPOSE The success of immunotherapy with dendritic cells (DC) to treat cancer is dependent on effective migration to the lymph nodes and subsequent activation of antigen-specific T cells. In this study, we investigated the fate of DC after intradermal (i.d.) or intranodal (i.n.) administration and the consequences for the immune activating potential of DC vaccines in melanoma patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN DC were i.d. or i.n. administered to 25 patients with metastatic melanoma scheduled for regional lymph node resection. To track DC in vivo with scintigraphic imaging and in lymph nodes by immunohistochemistry, cells were labeled with both [(111)In]-indium and superparamagnetic iron oxide. RESULTS After i.d. injection, maximally 4% of the DC reached the draining lymph nodes. When correctly delivered, all DC were delivered to one or more lymph nodes after i.n. injection. Independent of the route of administration, large numbers of DC remained at the injection site, lost viability, and were cleared by infiltrating CD163+ macrophages within 48 hours. Interestingly, 87 +/- 10% of the surviving DC preferentially migrated into the T-cell areas, where they induced antigen-specific T-cell responses. Even though more DC reached the T-cell areas, i.n. injection of DC induced similar antigen-specific immune responses as i.d. injection. Immune responses were already induced with <5 x 10(5) DC migrating into the T-cell areas. CONCLUSIONS Monocyte-derived DC have high immune activating potential irrespective of the route of vaccination. Limited numbers of DC in the draining lymph nodes are sufficient to induce antigen-specific immunologic responses.

[Study on transmission dynamic of 15 clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 cases in Ningbo].

Objective: To describe the basic characteristics of clusters of coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Ningbo, Zhejiang province, and evaluate the generation time (Tg) and basic reproduction number (R(0)) of COVID-19. Methods: The basic information and onset times of the clusters of COVID-19 cases in Ningbo were investigated, the inter-generational interval of the cases were fitted by using gamma distribution, and the R(0) was calculated based on the SEIR model. Results: In the 15 clusters of COVID-19 cases, a total of 52 confirmed cases, 5 cases of nucleic acid- positive asymptomatic cases. The cases occurred from January 23 to February 4, the cases were mainly women. The incubation period was (6.11±3.38) days, and the median was 5 days. The Tg was (6.93±3.70) days. There were no significant differences in Tg between age group <60 years and age group 60 years and above, and between men and women (P=0.551). According to the Tg calculated in this paper, the R(0) of COVID-19 in Ningbo was 3.06 (95%CI: 2.64 - 3.51); according to the reported case transmission interval of 7.5 days in the literature, the R(0) was 3.32 (95%CI: 2.51-9.38 ). Conclusion: There is no age and gender specific differences in the Tg of clusters of COVID-19 cases in Ningbo, and COVID-19 has high infectivity and spreading power in early phase.

CT Scans Obtained for Nonpulmonary Indications: Associated Respiratory Findings of COVID-19.

Background Atypical manifestations of COVID-19 are being encountered as the pandemic unfolds, leading to non-chest CT scans that may uncover unsuspected pulmonary disease. Purpose To investigate patients with primary non-respiratory symptoms who underwent abdomen/pelvis or cervical spine/neck CT with unsuspected findings highly suspicious for pulmonary COVID-19. Materials and Methods This retrospective study from March 10, 2020 to April 6, 2020 involved three institutions, two in a region considered a hotspot (area of high prevalence) for COVID-19. Patients without known COVID-19 were included who presented to the emergency room (ER) with primary non-respiratory [gastrointestinal (GI) or neurological] symptoms, had lung parenchymal findings suspicious for COVID-19 on a non-chest CT but no concurrent chest CT and had COVID-19 testing in the ER. Group 1 patients had RT PCR obtained pre-CT read (COVID-19 suspected on presentation); Group 2 had RT PCR obtained post-CT read (COVID-19 not suspected). Presentation and imaging findings were compared and outcomes were evaluated. Descriptive statistics and Fisher exact tests were used for analysis. Results Group 1 comprised 62 patients [31 men, 31 women, mean age 67(SD ±17) years] and group 2 comprised 57 patients [28 men, 29 women, mean age 63(SD ± 16) years). Cough and fever were more common in group 1 (37/62, 60%, 29/62, 47%) than group 2 (9/57, 16%, 12/57, 21%) respectively, with no significant difference in the remaining symptoms. There were 101 abdomen/pelvis and 18 cervical spine/neck CTs. In Group 1, non-chest CT findings provided the initial evidence of COVID-19 related pneumonia in 32/62 (52%); for Group 2, it was 44/57 (77%). Overall, the most common CT findings were ground glass opacity (114/119, 96%) and consolidation (47/119,40%). 29/119 (24%) patients required major interventions (vasopressor medication or intubation) and 27/119 (23%) died. Patients who underwent cervical spine/neck CT had worse outcomes than those with abdominal/pelvic CT (p =0.01). Conclusion In a substantial percentage of patients with primary non-respiratory symptoms who underwent non-chest CT, the CT provided the first evidence of COVID-19 related pneumonia.

Outbreak column 18: The undervalued work of outbreak: prevention, preparedness, detection and management.

There are oft-quoted studies which advise that between 1% and 10% of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) present as healthcare-associated outbreaks (HAOs). Examination of these studies showed they lacked validity due to a low sensitivity to detect HAO, and because they pre-date both advanced healthcare systems and the emergence of recent nosocomial pathogen challenges. The accepted inference: that as there are so few HAOs the focus of surveillance programmes should be on endemic and not epidemic infections (outbreaks), is therefore called into question. Current estimates of HAI burden are derived from Point Prevalence Surveys (PPS) which are neither designed to nor are capable of detecting HAOs. We considered the extensive Infection Prevention and Control Team (IPCT) work to prevent and prepare for perennial and novel HAOs and suggest that at present this endeavour is largely unseen, underestimated and undervalued. Any HAI burden estimate needs to comprise a more complete HAI summary than PPS data. This can only be done with a more inclusive surveillance system that has a wider focus than just prevalent infections. There is a real risk of redirection of the IPCT resource from outbreak prevention and preparedness work towards HAI that are counted: such a change could only further increase HAO risks.

Pediatric single port transumbilical nephrectomy and nephroureterectomy.

OBJECTIVE To present seven cases of single incision laparoscopic nephrectomy and nephroureterectomy in children as a recent videoscopic innovation. PATIENTS AND METHODS Seven children with nonfunctioning kidneys, three with multicystic dysplastic kidneys, two with end-stage renal nephropathy due to vesicoureteral reflux, and two with giant hydronephrosis were qualified to nephrectomy or nephroureterectomy. The surgery was performed transperitoneally using single incision access laparoscopy. The operative time was in the range of 50-90 min. RESULTS There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. The patients were discharged on the third postoperative day. The incision scars were hidden inside the umbilicus. CONCLUSIONS Nephrectomy or nephroureterectomy using a single transumbilical port in children is a feasible and efficacious technique. The advantages are shortened convalescence, excellent cosmetic results, and reduction of potential wounds complications. However, clear indication of single site laparoscopic procedures in children remains to be clarified.

Prophylactic and postexposure efficacy of a potent human monoclonal antibody against MERS coronavirus.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a highly lethal pulmonary infection caused by a previously unidentified coronavirus (CoV), likely transmitted to humans by infected camels. There is no licensed vaccine or antiviral for MERS, therefore new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat human infections are needed. In this study, we describe, for the first time, to our knowledge, the isolation of a potent MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibody from memory B cells of an infected individual. The antibody, named LCA60, binds to a novel site on the spike protein and potently neutralizes infection of multiple MERS-CoV isolates by interfering with the binding to the cellular receptor CD26. Importantly, using mice transduced with adenovirus expressing human CD26 and infected with MERS-CoV, we show that LCA60 can effectively protect in both prophylactic and postexposure settings. This antibody can be used for prophylaxis, for postexposure prophylaxis of individuals at risk, or for the treatment of human cases of MERS-CoV infection. The fact that it took only 4 mo from the initial screening of B cells derived from a convalescent patient for the development of a stable chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line producing neutralizing antibodies at more than 5 g/L provides an example of a rapid pathway toward the generation of effective antiviral therapies against emerging viruses.

Time and diffusion lesion size in major anterior circulation ischemic strokes.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Major anterior circulation ischemic strokes caused by occlusion of the distal internal carotid artery or proximal middle cerebral artery or both account for about one third of ischemic strokes with mostly poor outcomes. These strokes are treatable by intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator and endovascular methods. However, dynamics of infarct growth in these strokes are poorly documented. The purpose was to help understand infarct growth dynamics by measuring acute infarct size with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at known times after stroke onset in patients with documented internal carotid artery/middle cerebral artery occlusions. METHODS Retrospectively, we included 47 consecutive patients with documented internal carotid artery/middle cerebral artery occlusions who underwent DWI within 30 hours of stroke onset. Prospectively, 139 patients were identified using the same inclusion criteria. DWI lesion volumes were measured and correlated to time since stroke onset. Perfusion data were reviewed in those who underwent perfusion imaging. RESULTS Acute infarct volumes ranged from 0.41 to 318.3 mL. Infarct size and time did not correlate (R2=0.001). The majority of patients had DWI lesions that were <25% the territory at risk (<70 mL) whether they were imaged <8 or >8 hours after stroke onset. DWI lesions corresponded to areas of greatly reduced perfusion. CONCLUSIONS Poor correlation between infarct volume and time after stroke onset suggests that there are factors more powerful than time in determining infarct size within the first 30 hours. The observations suggest that highly variable cerebral perfusion via the collateral circulation may primarily determine infarct growth dynamics. If verified, clinical implications include the possibility of treating many patients outside traditional time windows.

Incidence, Predictors, and Impact of Post-Discharge Bleeding After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.

BACKGROUND The incidence, predictors, and prognostic impact of post-discharge bleeding (PDB) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation are unclear. OBJECTIVES This study sought to characterize the determinants and consequences of PDB after PCI. METHODS The prospective ADAPT-DES (Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents) study was used to determine the incidence and predictors of clinically relevant bleeding events occurring within 2 years after hospital discharge. The effect of PDB on subsequent 2-year all-cause mortality was estimated by time-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS Among 8,582 "all-comers" who underwent successful PCI with DES in the ADAPT-DES study, PDB occurred in 535 of 8,577 hospital survivors (6.2%) at a median time of 300 days (interquartile range: 130 to 509 days) post-discharge. Gastrointestinal bleeding (61.7%) was the most frequent source of PDB. Predictors of PDB included older age, lower baseline hemoglobin, lower platelet reactivity on clopidogrel, and use of chronic oral anticoagulation therapy. PDB was associated with higher crude rates of all-cause mortality (13.0% vs. 3.2%; p < 0.0001). Following multivariable adjustment, PDB was strongly associated with 2-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.03; p < 0.0001), with an effect size greater than that of post-discharge myocardial infarction (PDMI) (HR: 1.92; p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS After successful PCI with DES in an unrestricted patient population, PDB is not uncommon and has a strong relationship with subsequent all-cause mortality, greater that that associated with PDMI. Efforts to reduce PDB may further improve prognosis after successful DES implantation. (Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents [ADAPT-DES]; NCT00638794).

Liquid Embolic Agents in Spectral X-Ray Photon-Counting Computed Tomography using Tantalum K-Edge Imaging.

The aim was to evaluate the potential of Spectral Photon-Counting Computed Tomography (SPCCT) to differentiate between liquid embolic agents and iodinated contrast medium by using tantalum-characteristic K-edge imaging. Tubes with a concentration series of tantalum and inserts with different concentrations of iodine were scanned with a preclinical SPCCT system. Tantalum density maps (TDM) and iodine density maps (IDM) were generated from a SPCCT acquisition. Furthermore, region-of-interest (ROI) analysis was performed within the tubes in the conventional CT, the TDM and IDM. TDM and IDM enable clear differentiation between both substances. Quantitative measurements of different tantalum concentrations match well with those of actually diluted mixtures. SPCCT allows for differentiation between tantalum and iodine and may enable for an improved follow-up diagnosis in patients after vascular occlusion therapy.

Implications of public understanding of avian influenza for fostering effective risk communication.

Avian influenza has three of the four properties necessary to cause a pandemic. However, are we as individuals and communities prepared for a pandemic flu in the United States? To help answer this question, 12 focus groups (N = 60) were conducted in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to determine the level of awareness of avian and pandemic flu for the county health department to develop effective communication messages. The overall findings indicate that the general Tulsa public lacks information about avian influenza or pandemics, does not believe a pandemic will occur, and believes if one does occur the government will take care of it. Finally, the groups agreed that education would be the key to preventing widespread panic if a pandemic occurred. Five themes emerged: confusion about terminology, seriousness of avian influenza, disaster fatigue, appropriate precautions, and credibility of health information. Each should be considered in developing effective risk communication messages.

Modification of the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus for vaccine development.

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes an infectious respiratory disease of domestic fowl that affects poultry of all ages causing economic problems for the poultry industry worldwide. Although IBV is controlled using live attenuated and inactivated vaccines it continues to be a major problem due to the existence of many serotypes, determined by the surface spike protein resulting in poor cross-protection, and loss of immunogenicity associated with vaccine production. Live attenuated IBV vaccines are produced by the repeated passage in embryonated eggs resulting in spontaneous mutations. As a consequence attenuated viruses have only a few mutations responsible for the loss of virulence, which will differ between vaccines affecting virulence and/or immunogenicity and can revert to virulence. A new generation of vaccines is called for and one means of controlling IBV involves the development of new and safer vaccines by precisely modifying the IBV genome using reverse genetics for the production of rationally attenuated IBVs in order to obtain an optimum balance between loss of virulence and capacity to induce immunity.

Endovascular management of extensive lower extremity acute deep vein thrombosis with AngioJet rheolytic thrombectomy plus catheter-directed thrombolysis from contralateral femoral access.

PURPOSE The aim of the present study was to report the clinical outcomes of endovascular treatment for extensive lower limb deep vein thrombosis with AngioJet rheolytic thrombectomy (ART) plus catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) using a contralateral femoral approach. METHODS A retrospective analysis of consecutive ART+CDT treatments in 38 deep vein thrombosis patients (LET I-III, from September 2014 to March 2016) was performed. RESULTS The technical success rate was 100%. Complete lysis was achieved in 82% of LET III segments (calf veins), 87% of LET II segments (popliteal-femoral veins), and 90% of LET III segments (iliac veins). The best results were obtained in patients treated within seven days of symptom onset. During follow-up, well-preserved, competent femoral valves were observed in 86% of the patients, and recanalization of LET III, LET II, and LET I segments was achieved in 100%, 94%, and 91% of the patients, respectively. The post-thrombotic syndrome rate was 17% during a mean 20-month follow-up.

Robotic versus laparoscopic rectal resection for sphincter-saving surgery: pathological and short-term outcomes in a single-center analysis of 130 consecutive patients.

BACKGROUND Minimally invasive sphincter-saving rectal resection represents a challenging procedure. Robotic surgery for rectal cancer has several advantages over conventional surgery in performing precise dissection and was proved to be safe and effective in previous studies. However, comparison between laparoscopic and robotic rectal resection has drawn contradictory results. The aim of the present study was to compare robotic and laparoscopic sphincter-saving rectal resections for short-term and pathological outcomes. METHODS Between January 2013 and May 2016, we performed a total of 258 robotic surgeries, including 146 colorectal resections (56%). For this study, we included the first 65 sphincter-saving robotic resections and compared them to the last 65 consecutive laparoscopic resections. The laparoscopic group was constituted by the last 65 consecutively operated patients who matched the inclusion criteria. RESULTS Patients' baseline characteristics were similar in both the groups. Conversion rate was greater in the laparoscopic group (17 vs. 5%, p=0.044). Reoperation rate, overall and severe morbidity, and median hospital stay were similar in both the groups. Quality of mesorectal excision specimen was considered complete or near complete in 97 and 96% in the laparoscopic and robotic groups, respectively. There was no difference in the rates of negative circumferential radial margin, distal margin, and surgical success measured by composite criteria. CONCLUSION The main finding of this study was that robotic proctectomy for sphincter-saving procedures offers similar quality of TME with a statistically significant lower rate of conversion when compared to laparoscopic proctectomy.

Anesthesia and increased hypercarbic drive impair the coordination between breathing and swallowing.

BACKGROUND Coordination between breathing and swallowing helps prevent aspiration of foreign material into the respiratory tract. The authors examined the effects of anesthesia and hypercapnia on swallowing-breathing coordination. METHODS In a randomized controlled crossover study, general anesthesia with propofol or sevoflurane was titrated using an up-down method to identify the threshold for suppression of the motor response to electrical stimulation of the forearm. Additional measurements included bispectral index, genioglossus electromyogram, ventilation (pneumotachometer), and hypopharyngeal pressure. During wakefulness and at each level of anesthesia, carbon dioxide was added to increase the end-tidal pressure by 4 and 8 mmHg. A swallow was defined as increased genioglossus activity with deglutition apnea and an increase in hypopharyngeal pressure. Spontaneous swallows were categorized as physiological (during expiration or followed by expiration) or pathological (during inspiration or followed by an inspiration). RESULTS A total of 224 swallows were analyzed. Anesthesia increased the proportion of pathological swallows (25.9% vs. 4.9%) and decreased the number of swallows per hour (1.7±3.3 vs. 28.0±22.3) compared to wakefulness. During anesthesia, hypercapnia decreased hypopharyngeal pressure during inspiration (-14.1±3.7 vs. -8.7±2 mmHg) and increased minute ventilation, the proportion of pathological swallows (19.1% vs. 12.3%), and the number of swallows per hour (5.5±17.0. vs. 1.3±5.5). CONCLUSIONS Anesthesia impaired the coordination between swallowing and respiration. Mild hypercapnia increased the frequency of swallowing during anesthesia and the likelihood of pathological swallowing. During anesthesia, the risk for aspiration may be further increased when ventilatory drive is stimulated.

Guidelines for Frontline Health Care Staff Safety for COVID-19.

This document establishes safety guidelines for physicians, nurses, and allied health care and facility staff who may be exposed to patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a health care facility. SARS-CoV-2 infection is highly contagious and places health care workers at risk for infection resulting in coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Physicians, nurses, and allied health care and facility staff in all frontline environments must be provided and utilize necessary personal protective equipment (PPE). It is important that health care staff adopt a universal set of guidelines in which to conduct themselves in order to minimize infection with the SARS-CoV-2 contagion. The establishment of these guidelines is necessary in this viral pandemic since such directives can create a standard of safety that is universally accepted. These guidelines establish a framework to provide consistency among health care facilities and staff from the time the staff member arrives at the health care facility until they return home. These guidelines provide a practical description of the minimum necessary protection for physicians, nurses, and allied health care and facility staff against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Single-port laparoscopic total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis: initial operative experience.

BACKGROUND Single-port laparoscopic surgery (SPLS) has been used in urologic, gynecologic, general, and colorectal surgery. We herein report our experience with the use of SPLS for total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (RP/IPAA). METHODS All patients who underwent a RP/IPAA using SPLS between June and September 2009 were identified from a prospectively maintained laparoscopic database. All procedures were performed with the use of a 5-mm Olympus EndoEye™ and traditional laparoscopic instruments via a SILS™ port placed at the planned ileostomy site. RESULTS There were five patients (3 male) included in the study. Median age was 43 years (range=13-47 years). Median body mass index was 20.66 kg/m2 (range=14.63-25.97 kg/m2). Diagnoses included ulcerative colitis (n=4) and familial adenomatous polyposis (n=1). Median ASA score was 2 (range=1-3). Median operative time was 153 min (range=132-278 min). Median estimated blood loss was 100 ml (range=50-200 ml). There were no conversions to either a conventional laparoscopic or an open procedure. Median time to return of bowel function was 2 days. Median length of stay was 4 days (range=3-6 days). Postoperative complications included two patients with partial small-bowel obstructions. Both resolved with conservative management. All patients had their ileostomies closed. CONCLUSION RP/IPAA using SPLS is a safe technique. Additional studies are needed to compare SPLS to conventional laparoscopy and open surgery with respect to operative times, convalescence, and outcomes.

Automated Detection of TMJ Osteoarthritis Based on Artificial Intelligence.

The purpose of this study was to develop a diagnostic tool to automatically detect temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA) from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images with artificial intelligence. CBCT images of patients diagnosed with temporomandibular disorder were included for image preparation. Single-shot detection, an object detection model, was trained with 3,514 sagittal CBCT images of the temporomandibular joint that showed signs of osseous changes in the mandibular condyle. The region of interest (condylar head) was defined and classified into 2 categories-indeterminate for TMJOA and TMJOA-according to image analysis criteria for the diagnosis of temporomandibular disorder. The model was tested with 2 sets of 300 images in total. The average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score over the 2 test sets were 0.86, 0.85, 0.84, and 0.84, respectively. Automated detection of TMJOA from sagittal CBCT images is possible by using a deep neural networks model. It may be used to support clinicians with diagnosis and decision making for treatments of TMJOA.

Ebola Preparedness: Diagnosis Improvement Using Rapid Approaches for Proficiency Testing.

The unprecedented 2015 Ebolavirus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa was declared a public health emergency, making diagnosis and quality of testing a global issue. The accuracy of laboratory diagnostic capacity for EBOV was assessed in 2014 to 2016 using a proficiency testing (PT) strategy developed by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia Quality Assurance Programs (RCPAQAP) in Biosecurity. Following a literature search, EBOV-specific gene targets were ranked according to the frequency of their use in published methods. The most commonly used gene regions (nucleoprotein [NP], glycoprotein [GP], and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [L]) were selected for the design of in vitro RNA transcripts to be included in the simulated EBOV specimens used for EBOV detection with PCR-based assays. Specimens were tested for stability and found to be stable on long-term storage (1 year) at -80°C and on shorter-term storage in lyophilized form (1 week at ambient temperature and a subsequent week at -80°C). These specimens were used in three EBOV PTs offered from April 2014 to March 2016. In the first and third PTs, all laboratories (3/3 and 9/9, respectively) correctly identified specimens containing EBOV RNA transcripts, while in the second PT, all but one laboratory (5/6) correctly confirmed the presence of EBOV. The EBOV PT panel was useful for ensuring the competency of laboratories in detecting EBOV in the absence of readily available clinical samples. The simulated EBOV specimen was safe, stable, and reliable and can be used in lyophilized form for future EBOV PT programs, allowing simplicity of transport.

Relationship between risk factor control and vascular events in the SAMMPRIS trial.

OBJECTIVE The Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis (SAMMPRIS) study is the first stroke prevention trial to include protocol-driven intensive management of multiple risk factors. In this prespecified analysis, we aimed to investigate the relationship between risk factor control during follow-up and outcome of patients in the medical arm of SAMMPRIS. METHODS Data from SAMMPRIS participants in the medical arm (n = 227) were analyzed. Risk factors were recorded at baseline, 30 days, 4 months, and then every 4 months for a mean follow-up of 32 months. For each patient, values for all risk factor measures were averaged and dichotomized as in or out of target. RESULTS Participants who were out of target for systolic blood pressure and physical activity, as well as those with higher mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein, were more likely to have a recurrent vascular event (stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death) at 3 years compared to those who had good risk factor control. In the multivariable analysis, greater physical activity decreased the likelihood of a recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death (odds ratio 0.6, confidence interval 0.4-0.8). CONCLUSIONS Raised blood pressure, cholesterol, and physical inactivity should be aggressively treated in patients with intracranial atherosclerosis to prevent future vascular events. Physical activity, which has not received attention in stroke prevention trials, was the strongest predictor of a good outcome in the medical arm in SAMMPRIS.

Air travel and pregnancy outcomes: a review of pregnancy regulations and outcomes for passengers, flight attendants, and aviators.

To review flight regulations and gestational complications associated with air travel in pregnant passengers, flight attendants, and aviators. A literature search was undertaken on the relationship of air travel and spontaneous pregnancy losses, intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD), birth weight<10th percentile, preterm delivery, and neonatal intensive care unit admissions. The literature search identified 128 abstracts, of which 9 evaluated air travel and pregnancy outcomes. The risk of a pregnancy loss (spontaneous abortion or IUFD) was greater in flight attendants than controls (odds ratio [OR]: 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29, 2.04). The risk of preterm birth<37 weeks was greater in passengers than controls (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.93). However, the risk of preeclampsia (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.58, 1.27), neonatal intensive care unit admissions (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.78, 1.82), or birth weight<10th percentile (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 0.62, 2.48) was not increased. Flight attendants did not have an increased risk of preterm birth compared to controls (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 0.85, 2.22) or delivering infants with birth weight<10th percentile (OR: 1.57, 95% CI: 0.68, 3.74). The risks of spontaneous abortions and other adverse pregnancy outcomes have been poorly studied in a limited number of investigations. An analysis of the available information suggests a greater risk of spontaneous abortions or IUFD in flight attendants, and a greater risk of preterm birth<37 weeks in air passengers. However, the literature on which these findings are based is generally not of high methodologic quality.

Crystal structure of HAb18G/CD147: implications for immunoglobulin superfamily homophilic adhesion.

CD147, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), plays fundamental roles in intercellular interactions in numerous pathological and physiological processes. Importantly, our previous studies have demonstrated that HAb18G/CD147 is a novel hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-associated antigen, and HAb18G/CD147 stimulates adjacent fibroblasts and HCC cells to produce elevated levels of several matrix metalloproteinases, facilitating invasion and metastasis of HCC cells. In addition, HAb18G/CD147 has also been shown to be a novel universal cancer biomarker for diagnosis and prognostic assessment of a wide range of cancers. However, the structural basis underlying the multifunctional character of CD147 remains unresolved. We report here the crystal structure of the extracellular portion of HAb18G/CD147 at 2.8A resolution. The structure comprises an N-terminal IgC2 domain and a C-terminal IgI domain, which are connected by a 5-residue flexible linker. This unique C2-I domain organization is distinct from those of other IgSF members. Four homophilic dimers exist in the crystal and adopt C2-C2 and C2-I dimerization rather than V-V dimerization commonly found in other IgSF members. This type of homophilic association thus presents a novel model for homophilic interaction between C2 domains of IgSF members. Moreover, the crystal structure of HAb18G/CD147 provides a good structural explanation for the established multifunction of CD147 mediated by homo/hetero-oligomerizations and should represent a general architecture of other CD147 family members.

Selective versus routine lymphadenectomy in the treatment of liver metastasis from colorectal cancer: a retrospective cohort study.

BACKGROUND Limited data are available on the importance of routine lymphadenectomy of the hepatoduodenal ligament in the treatment of liver metastasis from colorectal cancer in the literature. METHODS A single center retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate morbidity and long-term survival in patients who had undergone selective versus routine lymphadenectomy during surgery for colorectal liver metastasis. From January 2006 to December 2009, eighty-one patients undergoing radical resection due to liver metastasis from colorectal cancer were included. The combination of two surgical teams with different approaches to hepatoduodenal ligament lymphadenectomy at our institution allowed us to select two cohorts of patients undergoing selective or routine lymphadenectomy. RESULTS No significant differences between the cohorts were found in age, American Society of Anesthesiology score or Fong's prognostic criteria. Patients with pN+ disease had significantly inferior survival compared to patients with pN0 disease (hazard ratio [HR] = 6.33, 95% CI 2.16-18.57, p = 0.0001). No significant difference in postoperative morbidity was observed in the group undergoing routine opposed to selective lymphadenectomy (13.63% vs. 8.69%, p = 0.36). There was no difference in long-term survival between the groups (HR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.52-1.58, p = 0.70). There were also no significant differences in the subgroup of patients with pN0 stage (HR = 1.17, 95% CI 0.6-2.11, p = 0.60). CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that there is no survival benefit from the use of routine lymphadenectomy during surgery for colorectal liver metastasis, but these data should be confirmed in a prospective randomized study.

Laparoscopic intracorporeal rectus aponeuroplasty (LIRA technique): a step forward in minimally invasive abdominal wall reconstruction for ventral hernia repair (LVHR).

BACKGROUND Closing the defect (CD) during laparoscopic ventral hernia repair began to be performed in order to decrease seroma, to improve the functionality of the abdominal wall, and to decrease the bulging effect. However, tension at the incision after CD in large defects is related to an increased rate of pain and recurrence. We present the preliminary results of a new technique for medium midline hernias as an alternative to conventional CD. METHODS A prospective controlled study was conducted from January 2015 to January 2017 to evaluate an elective new procedure (LIRA) performed on patients with midline ventral hernias (4-10 cm width). The posterior rectus aponeurosis was opened lengthwise around the hernia defect using a laparoscopic approach to create two flaps and was then sutured. The size of the flaps was estimated using a mathematical formula. An on-lay mesh was placed intraperitoneal overlapping the fascia defect. The data analyzed included patient demographics, operative parameters, and complications. A computerized tomography was performed preoperatively and postoperatively (1 month and 1 year) to evaluate recurrence, distance between rectus and seroma. RESULTS Twelve patients were included. Mean width of the defect was 5.5 cm. Average VAS (24 h) was 3.9, 1.1 (1 month), and 0 (1 year). Mean preoperative distance between rectus was 5.5 cm; postoperative was 2.2 cm (1 year). Radiological seroma at first month was detected in 50%. Mean follow-up was 15 months. CONCLUSION The LIRA technique could be considered as an alternative to conventional CD or endoscopic component separation for medium defects under 10 cm in width. This technique obtained a "no tension" effect that could be related to a lower rate of postoperative pain with no recurrence or bulging, being a safe, feasible, and reproducible technique.

A systematic review of multi-level stigma interventions: state of the science and future directions.

BACKGROUND Researchers have long recognized that stigma is a global, multi-level phenomenon requiring intervention approaches that target multiple levels including individual, interpersonal, community, and structural levels. While existing interventions have produced modest reductions in stigma, their full reach and impact remain limited by a nearly exclusive focus targeting only one level of analysis. METHODS We conducted the first systematic review of original research on multi-level stigma-reduction interventions. We used the following eligibility criteria for inclusion: (1) peer-reviewed, (2) contained original research, (3) published prior to initiation of search on November 30, 2017, (4) evaluated interventions that operated on more than one level, and (5) examined stigma as an outcome. We stratified and analyzed articles by several domains, including whether the research was conducted in a low-, middle-, or high-income country. RESULTS Twenty-four articles met the inclusion criteria. The articles included a range of countries (low, middle, and high income), stigmatized conditions/populations (e.g., HIV, mental health, leprosy), intervention targets (e.g., people living with a stigmatized condition, health care workers, family, and community members), and stigma reduction strategies (e.g., contact, social marketing, counseling, faith, problem solving), with most using education-based approaches. A total of 12 (50%) articles examined community-level interventions alongside interpersonal and/or intrapersonal levels, but only 1 (4%) combined a structural-level intervention with another level. Of the 24 studies, only 6 (25%) were randomized controlled trials. While most studies (17 of 24) reported statistically significant declines in at least one measure of stigma, fewer than half reported measures of practical significance (i.e., effect size); those that were reported varied widely in magnitude and were typically in the small-to-moderate range. CONCLUSIONS While there has been progress over the past decade in the development and evaluation of multi-level stigma interventions, much work remains to strengthen and expand this approach. We highlight several opportunities for new research and program development.

Body Mass Index as a Moderator of Treatment Response to Ketamine for Major Depressive Disorder.

PURPOSE/BACKGROUND Major depressive disorder (MDD) and obesity commonly co-occur. We sought to assess the impact of body mass index (BMI) on the acute antidepressant effects of ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS/PROCEDURES Post hoc analyses were conducted from a multisite, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the rapid-onset effects of intravenous ketamine. Patients (n = 99) were randomized to a single dose administration of ketamine 0.1 mg/kg (n = 18), ketamine 0.2 mg/kg (n = 20), ketamine 0.5 mg/kg (n = 22), ketamine 1.0 mg/kg (n = 20), or active placebo, midazolam 0.045 mg/kg (n = 19). Patients were stratified for BMI. For patients randomized to ketamine (n = 80), BMI was assessed as a continuous variable and also categorically (obese, overweight, not obese/overweight [reference]). The primary outcome measure was the change on the 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 24 hours after treatment. Outcomes at day 3 were also assessed. FINDINGS/RESULTS The 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale change scores at 24 hours were inversely associated with BMI (-0.28 ± 0.12, P = 0.02). With BMI operationalized categorically, both obese (-4.15 ± 1.41, P = 0.004) and overweight (-1.99 ± 1.14, P = 0.08) categories were inversely related to the 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale change score at 24 hours, statistically significant for the obese category, as compared with the reference group. Similar but weaker findings were observed at 72 hours after infusion. IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS Higher BMI and obesity were associated with a more robust acute antidepressant response to ketamine. This may have clinical relevance for a great number of patients who have both MDD and obesity. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NCT01920555.

Laparoscopic reconversion of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass to original anatomy: technique and preliminary outcomes.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the most common bariatric procedures performed. Dumping syndrome, intolerance to RYGB-induced restriction, and weight loss issues are possible problems bariatric surgeons are confronted with. This study reports the feasibility, safety, and outcomes of laparoscopic reconversion of RYGB to original anatomy (OA) as treatment of these complications. METHODS Between January 2005 and April 2008, eight patients benefited from laparoscopic reconversion of RYGB to OA. Reason was dumping syndrome without postprandial hypoglycemia (three), intolerance to RYGB-induced restriction (three), too much (one) and too little weight loss (one). Mean weight and body mass index (BMI) at RYGB were 104.7±19.3 kg and 38.7±6 kg/m(2), respectively. Four patients suffered of obesity co-morbidities. Mean time between RYGB and reconversion was 21±18.8 months. Mean weight, BMI, and % excess weight loss at reconversion was 66.8±21.7 kg, 20.1±7 kg/m(2), and 23.7±55%, respectively. The procedure involved dismantling both gastrojejunostomy and jejunojejunostomy, reanastomosing gastric pouch to gastric remnant, and proximal alimentary limb end to distal biliary limb end. RESULTS Mean operative time was 132.2±29.5 min. There were no conversions to open surgery and no early complications. Gastrogastrostomy was performed manually (four) and by linear stapler (four), and jejunojejunostomy by linear stapler (eight). Mean hospital stay was 7.7±3.5 days. After a mean follow-up of 18.3±9.2 months, two patients continued to further lose weight, two patients maintained the same weight, and four patients presented weight regain. Gastroesophageal reflux disease appeared in three patients. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic reconversion of RYGB to OA is feasible and safe. Dumping syndrome and intolerance to RYGB-induced restriction are resolved. The anatomy remains one of the aspects besides nutritional and psychological factors in cases of reconversion for weight issues.

Chikungunya virus emergence is constrained in Asia by lineage-specific adaptive landscapes.

Adaptation of RNA viruses to a new host or vector species often results in emergence of new viral lineages. However, lineage-specific restrictions on the adaptive processes remain largely unexplored. Recently, a Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) lineage of African origin emerged to cause major epidemics of severe, persistent, debilitating arthralgia in Africa and Asia. Surprisingly, this new lineage is actively replacing endemic strains in Southeast Asia that have been circulating there for 60 y. This replacement process is associated with adaptation of the invasive CHIKV strains to an atypical vector, the Aedes albopictus mosquito that is ubiquitously distributed in the region. Here we demonstrate that lineage-specific epistatic interactions between substitutions at amino acid positions 226 and 98 of the E1 envelope glycoprotein, the latter of which likely resulted from a founder effect, have for 60 y restricted the ability of endemic Asian CHIKV strains to adapt to this new vector. This adaptive constraint appears to be allowing invasion of the unoccupied vector niche by Ae. albopictus-adapted African strains. These results underscore how different adaptive landscapes occupied by closely related viral genotypes can profoundly affect the outcome of viral evolution and disease emergence.

Dexamethasone, light anaesthesia, and tight glucose control (DeLiT) randomized controlled trial.

BACKGROUND The inflammatory response to surgical tissue injury is associated with perioperative morbidity and mortality. We tested the primary hypotheses that major perioperative morbidity is reduced by three potential anti-inflammatory interventions: (i) low-dose dexamethasone, (ii) intensive intraoperative glucose control, and (iii) lighter anaesthesia. METHODS We enrolled patients having major non-cardiac surgery who were ≥40 yr old and had an ASA physical status ≤IV. In a three-way factorial design, patients were randomized to perioperative i.v. dexamethasone (a total of 14 mg tapered over 3 days) vs placebo, intensive vs conventional glucose control 80-110 vs 180-200 mg dl(-1), and lighter vs deeper anaesthesia (bispectral index target of 55 vs 35). The primary outcome was a collapsed composite of 15 major complications and 30 day mortality. Plasma high-sensitivity (hs) C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration was measured before operation and on the first and second postoperative days. RESULTS The overall incidence of the primary outcome was about 20%. The trial was stopped after the second interim analysis with 381 patients, at which all three interventions crossed the futility boundary for the primary outcome. No three-way (P=0.70) or two-way (all P>0.52) interactions among the interventions were found. There was a significantly smaller increase in hsCRP in patients given dexamethasone than placebo [maximum 108 (64) vs 155 (69) mg litre(-1), P<0.001], but none of the other two interventions differentially influenced the hsCRP response to surgery. CONCLUSIONS Among our three interventions, dexamethasone alone reduced inflammation. However, no intervention reduced the risk of major morbidity or 1 yr mortality.

Perceived HIV-Associated Stigma among HIV-Seropositive Men: Psychometric Study of HIV Stigma Scale.

OBJECTIVES To assess the internal consistency and factor structure of the abridged Spanish version of the Berger HIV Stigma Scale (HSS-21), to provide evidence for its convergent and discriminant validity, and to describe perceived stigma in an urban population from northeast Mexico. METHODS Seventy-five HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) were recruited. Participants answered the Spanish versions of three Likert-type scales: HSS-21, Robsenberg's self-esteem scale, and the abbreviated version of the Zung's Depression Scale. RESULTS HSS-21 showed high reliability and validity; its factor structure included four components: concern with public attitudes; negative self-image; disclosure concerns; and enacted stigma. The level of stigma was high in 27 out of 75 (36%) participants; nevertheless, the score found in the component related to disclosure concerns indicated high level of stigma in 68% of participants. The score of HSS-21 was positively correlated with the score of depression and negatively correlated with the score of self-esteem. CONCLUSION Results demonstrated high reliability for the HSS-21; correlations with other scales supported its validity. This scale demonstrated to be a practical tool for assessing stigma among Mexican HIV-positive MSM. High level of stigma was found only in the factor related to disclosure concerns. POLICY IMPLICATIONS Identifying HIV-associated stigma through a short, reliable, and validated instrument will allow the development of interventions that cope and manage stigma in HIV-positive MSM. HSS-21 distinguishes between different dimensions of stigma and will contribute to a better understanding of this phenomenon.

Reproductive health paradigms in times of COVID-19.

For the past several months, we have witnessed one of the greatest global health challenges experienced by humankind. This unprecedented COVID-19 viral pandemic, characterized by its enigmatic nature and bewildering spread, respects no borders and has nearly paralyzed healthcare systems throughout the world. Indeed, in the absence of specific, proven medical interventions, healthcare systems have been overwhelmed, thus limiting their ability to treat patients with non-emergent medical conditions and those awaiting elective procedures. Although it is beyond the scope of this editorial to discuss what constitutes a necessary or elective procedure, this radical change in medical practice has had an enormous impact on discontinuation of fertility care services, especially the assisted reproductive technologies (ART). It is eminently clear that reducing or discontinuing elective procedures and essential ART treatments was crucial not only to enable hospitals and medical facilities to manage (or to treat) the explosive rise in SARS-CoV-2 patients, but also to reduce disease transmission vis-à-vis various mitigating strategies-especially individual isolation and social distancing, strategies utilized effectively in China and Italy.

Economic risk analysis model for bovine viral diarrhea virus biosecurity in cow-calf herds.

A stochastic model was designed to calculate the cost-effectiveness of biosecurity strategies for bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in cow-calf herds. Possible sources of BVDV introduction considered were imported animals, including the calves of pregnant imports, and fenceline contact with infected herds, including stocker cattle raised in adjacent pastures. Spread of BVDV through the herd was modeled with a stochastic SIR model. Financial consequences of BVDV, including lost income, treatment costs, and the cost of biosecurity strategies, were calculated for 10 years, based on the risks of a herd with a user-defined import profile. Results indicate that importing pregnant animals and stockers increased the financial risk of BVDV. Strategic testing in combination with vaccination most decreased the risk of high-cost outbreaks in most herds. The choice of a biosecurity strategy was specific to the risks of a particular herd.

Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy: do patients care?

INTRODUCTION Single-incision approaches to laparoscopic cholecystectomy typically involve increasing the size of the umbilical incision and eliminating three smaller incisions, but it is not intuitive that patients would view this as a benefit. We hypothesize that when patient satisfaction with standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy is assessed, most dissatisfaction will be linked to the umbilical incision and, given the option, patients would actually wish to eliminate this incision. METHODS Two hundred eighty-one female patients aged 18 to 40 years who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy over a 2-year period were identified, and data were collected on 125 patients. RESULTS Fewer than half of patients correctly remembered the number of incisions they had, with 57 patients (45.6%) recalling fewer incisions than were present. Of 58 patients reporting one site to be more painful, 38 (65.5%) cited the umbilical site as the most painful. Eighty-one patients (68.6%) would have preferred to eliminate an incision, with 51 of these (63.0%) choosing to eliminate the umbilical incision. CONCLUSION As single-incision cholecystectomy enlarges what is already a painful and undesirable incision, and since patients often do not recall the smaller incisions, we should ask ourselves whether surgeons and industry care more about this technique than do the patients to whom we offer it.

Oesophageal perforation in a neonate during transoesophageal echocardiography for cardiac surgery.

Oesophageal perforation is a rarely reported complication of transoesophageal echocardiography in infants. This case involves a 3.1-kg neonate with Trisomy 21, atrioventricular septal defect, and hypoplastic aortic arch undergoing aortic arch advancement and pulmonary artery banding. A paediatric transoesophageal echocardiography probe was placed intraoperatively causing a contained false passage from the oesophagus below the cricopharyngeus muscle with extension into the left posterior mediastinum. The perforation healed within 2 weeks without permanent sequelae after conservative medical management.

Progressive Motor Deficit is Mediated by the Denervation of Neuromuscular Junctions and Axonal Degeneration in Transgenic Mice Expressing Mutant (P301S) Tau Protein.

Tauopathies include a variety of neurodegenerative diseases associated with the pathological aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau, resulting in progressive cognitive decline and motor impairment. The underlying mechanism for motor deficits related to tauopathy is not yet fully understood. Here, we use a novel transgenic tau mouse line, Tau 58/4, with enhanced neuron-specific expression of P301S mutant tau to investigate the motor abnormalities in association with the peripheral nervous system. Using stationary beam, gait, and rotarod tests, motor deficits were found in Tau 58/4 mice already 3 months after birth, which deteriorated during aging. Hyperphosphorylated tau was detected in the cell bodies and axons of motor neurons. At the age of 9 and 12 months, significant denervation of the neuromuscular junction in the extensor digitorum longus muscle was observed in Tau 58/4 mice, compared to wild-type mice. Muscle hypotrophy was observed in Tau 58/4 mice at 9 and 12 months. Using electron microscopy, we observed ultrastructural changes in the sciatic nerve of 12-month-old Tau 58/4 mice indicative of the loss of large axonal fibers and hypomyelination (assessed by g-ratio). We conclude that the accumulated hyperphosphorylated tau in the axon terminals may induce dying-back axonal degeneration, myelin abnormalities, neuromuscular junction denervation, and muscular atrophy, which may be the mechanisms responsible for the deterioration of the motor function in Tau 58/4 mice. Tau 58/4 mice represent an interesting neuromuscular degeneration model, and the pathological mechanisms might be responsible for motor signs observed in some human tauopathies.

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt in a patient with ruptured blister aneurysm treated with pipeline embolization device.

Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) diversion is frequently required in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage who develop subsequent hydrocephalus. Procedures such as external ventricular drain (EVD) and ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) usually carry a very low rate of complications. However, as flow diverting stents such as Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) become more widely available, flow diverters are being used in treatment of some ruptured complex aneurysms. EVD and VPS placement in the setting of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) in these patients are associated with a significant risk of intracranial hemorrhage. We describe a management strategy and surgical technique that can minimize hemorrhagic complications associated with VPS in patients on DAT after treatment with flow diverting stents.

The Role of Anti-Neutrophil Antibodies in the Etiological Classification of Childhood Neutropenia: A Cross-Sectional Study in a Tertiary Center.

Infections, drugs, malignancies, immunodeficiency, and autoimmunity may cause neutropenia. In primary autoimmune neutropenia, anti-neutrophil antibodies (ANeuA) bind to membrane antigens of neutrophils, which give rise to peripheral destruction of neutrophils. However, it is not always easy to detect these antibodies. This study aims to investigate the etiology of neutropenia, and at the same time to evaluate the immune mechanisms by ANeuA testing using granulocyte indirect immunofluorescence test. In our study, 310 neutropenic patients who were between 3 months and 18 years of age were evaluated. ANeuA screening tests were performed in 108 neutropenic patients (group 1), and these patients were divided into 2 subgroups as persistent neutropenia (group 1P, n=12) and recovered neutropenia (group 1R, n=96). Besides, a control group in the same age range was formed, consisting of 39 non-neutropenic children (group 2). ANeuA serum levels were also checked in these groups, and no statistically significant difference could be found between groups 1 and 2, or between groups 1P and 1R, regarding ANeuA levels. As a conclusion, our study was the first comprehensive research in Turkey investigating the large-scale etiology of neutropenia. Moreover, while ANeuA screening tests did not provide sufficient insight for immune neutropenia, we argue that it is not necessary for routine use and that further research in the etiology of neutropenia is required.

ECG artifact cancellation in surface EMG signals by fractional order calculus application.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE New aspects for automatic electrocardiography artifact removal from surface electromyography signals by application of fractional order calculus in combination with linear and nonlinear moving window filters are explored. Surface electromyography recordings of skeletal trunk muscles are commonly contaminated with spike shaped artifacts. This artifact originates from electrical heart activity, recorded by electrocardiography, commonly present in the surface electromyography signals recorded in heart proximity. For appropriate assessment of neuromuscular changes by means of surface electromyography, application of a proper filtering technique of electrocardiography artifact is crucial. METHODS A novel method for automatic artifact cancellation in surface electromyography signals by applying fractional order calculus and nonlinear median filter is introduced. The proposed method is compared with the linear moving average filter, with and without prior application of fractional order calculus. 3D graphs for assessment of window lengths of the filters, crest factors, root mean square differences, and fractional calculus orders (called WFC and WRC graphs) have been introduced. For an appropriate quantitative filtering evaluation, the synthetic electrocardiography signal and analogous semi-synthetic dataset have been generated. The examples of noise removal in 10 able-bodied subjects and in one patient with muscle dystrophy are presented for qualitative analysis. RESULTS The crest factors, correlation coefficients, and root mean square differences of the recorded and semi-synthetic electromyography datasets showed that the most successful method was the median filter in combination with fractional order calculus of the order 0.9. Statistically more significant (p < 0.001) ECG peak reduction was obtained by the median filter application compared to the moving average filter in the cases of low level amplitude of muscle contraction compared to ECG spikes. CONCLUSIONS The presented results suggest that the novel method combining a median filter and fractional order calculus can be used for automatic filtering of electrocardiography artifacts in the surface electromyography signal envelopes recorded in trunk muscles.

Outcomes in children with deep vein thrombosis managed with percutaneous endovascular thrombolysis.

BACKGROUND Our center has developed a multidisciplinary approach to percutaneous endovascular thrombolysis with the goal of improving outcomes in children with thrombosis. There is little data describing the safety and efficacy of endovascular thrombolysis and the frequency of post-thrombotic syndrome after thrombolysis in children. OBJECTIVE Retrospective analysis of children undergoing percutaneous endovascular thrombolysis to determine (1) the safety and efficacy of this procedure and (2) the frequency of the diagnosis of post-thrombotic syndrome after thrombolysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed the medical and imaging databases for children who underwent percutaneous endovascular thrombolysis for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) between November 2008 and June 2013 at our institution. Demographic data were reviewed for the technical success and complications of thrombolysis and the last assigned post-thrombotic syndrome score using standardized scoring tools. RESULTS Forty-one children ages 3 months to 21 years (median age: 15 years; 44% male) underwent percutaneous endovascular thrombolysis between November 2008 and June 2013. Upper extremity DVT occurred in 13 patients (32%); lower extremity DVT occurred in 28 patients (68%). All 41 patients received thrombolysis grading; 90% of those patients achieved greater than 50% thrombus lysis. Twenty-eight patients received formal post-thrombotic syndrome scoring and 4 (14%) met diagnostic criteria for post-thrombotic syndrome. One major bleeding episode and one pulmonary embolism occurred with no long-term sequelae. CONCLUSION Endovascular thrombolysis for DVT in children is safe, effective at thrombus removal and may reduce the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome. Randomized or larger clinical trials would be needed to determine the long-term benefits of endovascular thrombolysis.

Video-assisted unilateral cricoarytenoid laryngoplasty in 14 dogs with bilateral idiopathic laryngeal paralysis.

BACKGROUND Unilateral cricoarytenoid laryngoplasty is commonly performed for treatment of idiopathic laryngeal paralysis in dogs. Determination of the appropriate tension applied to the suture can be difficult, particularly for the novice surgeon. OBJECTIVE To describe a technique for video-assisted unilateral cricoarytenoid laryngoplasty (VAUCAL) and to report short-term outcome in dogs undergoing VAUCAL. ANIMALS AND METHODS Dogs (n = 14) with bilateral idiopathic laryngeal paralysis undergoing VAUCAL between August 2011 and May 2013 were evaluated. A cricoarytenoid suture was tensioned under video observation of the rima glottidis using a 5-mm rigid endoscope. Real-time visualization of arytenoid abduction during suture tensioning, and final arytenoid position were assessed. Requirement for additional intravenous anesthestic, intra- and post-operative complications and short-term outcomes were documented. RESULTS Adequate, real-time visualization of the larynx during tensioning of the cricoarytenoid suture was accomplished in 13/14 dogs. Additional intravenous anesthesia was required in 5/14 dogs to facilitate reintubation. Final arytenoid position was considered inadequate in two dogs on post-operative trans-oral laryngeal examination. Recurrence of clinical signs occurred in one dog three months following initial surgery. Owner outcome was deemed good (n = 8) or excellent (n = 6). CONCLUSIONS VAUCAL is a feasible technique to permit direct real-time visualization of the larynx during tensioning of the cricoarytenoid suture, and enables assessment of final arytenoid position intra-operatively by the operating surgeon. CLINICAL IMPORTANCE VAUCAL allows the operating surgeon to assess arytenoid abduction intra-operatively, at the time of knot placement. This technique may be particularly useful for the novice surgeon or surgeon in training.

Percutaneous microwave thermosphere ablation of pancreatic tumours.

Background In oncologic field, thermo-ablative procedures have spread more and more. Percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) showed same benefits and some advantages over radiofrequency ablation (RFA). To date, a disadvantage of both was the not totally predictable size and shape of ablation volume. The aim of this study was to assess feasibility and safety of MWA in nonresectable pancreatic head cancer using a new technology of MW with high power (100 W) and frequency of 2,450 MH. Methods Five patients with pancreatic head cancer treated with percutaneous MWA under ultrasound guidance were retrospectively reviewed. Mean lesion diameter was 27.8 mm (range, 25-32 mm). Follow-up was performed by CT after 1, 3, 6 and, when possible, 12 months. The shape of the ablation volume was evaluated with multiplanar reformatting (MPR) using roundness index (RI): a value near 1 represents a more spherical ablation zone shape, and a value distant from 1 implies an oval configuration. Ablation and procedure times were registered, together with hospital stay. The feasibility, safety and quality of life (QoL) were reported. Results The procedure was feasible in all patients (100%). A spherical shape of ablation zone was achieved in all cases (mean RI =0.97). Mean ablation and procedure time were respectively of 2.48 and 28 minutes. Mean hospital stay was 4 days. No major complications were observed. Minor complications resolved during the hospital stay. An improvement in QoL was observed in all patients despite a tendency to return to preoperative levels in the months following the procedure. Conclusions Percutaneous MWA is a feasible and safe approach for the palliative treatment of advanced stage tumors of the head of the pancreas, despite its complex anatomic relations. The spherical shape of the ablation volume could be related with an improving of the effectiveness and safety.

Stabilized helical peptides: overview of the technologies and therapeutic promises.

INTRODUCTION Helical structures in proteins and naturally occurring peptides play a major role in a variety of biological processes by mediating interactions with proteins and other macromolecules such as nucleic acids and lipid membranes. The use of short synthetic peptides encompassing helical segments to modulate or disrupt such interactions, when associated with human diseases, represents great pharmacological interest. AREAS COVERED Multiple chemical approaches have been developed to increase the conformational and metabolic stabilities of helical peptides and to improve their biomedical potential. After a brief overview of these technologies and the most recent developments, this review will focus on the main therapeutic areas and targets and will discuss their promise. EXPERT OPINION Potential benefits associated with increased helix stability extend beyond simple affinity enhancement. Some peptidomimetic helices are being endowed with features desirable for cellular activity such as increased resistance to proteolysis and/or cell permeability. Recent advances in the field of peptide and related peptidomimetic helices are not just conceptual, but are likely to be of practical utility in the process of optimizing peptides as clinical candidates, and developing medium-size therapeutics.

Epidemiology and familial risk of synchronous and metachronous colorectal cancer: a population-based study in Utah.

BACKGROUND & AIMS Patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) are at risk for synchronous and metachronous lesions at the time of diagnosis or during follow-up evaluation. We performed a population-based study to evaluate the rate, predictors, and familial risk for synchronous and metachronous CRC in Utah. METHODS All newly diagnosed cases of CRC between 1980 and 2010 were obtained from the Utah Cancer Registry and linked to pedigrees from the Utah Population Database. RESULTS Of the 18,782 patients diagnosed with CRC, 134 were diagnosed with synchronous CRC (0.71%) and 300 were diagnosed with metachronous CRC (1.60%). The risk for synchronous CRC was significantly higher in men (odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-2.06) and in patients aged 65 years or older (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.02-2.21). Synchronous CRCs were located more often in the proximal colon (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.20-2.41). First-degree relatives of cases with synchronous (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.37-2.53), metachronous (OR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.62-3.36), or solitary CRC (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.63-1.88) were at increased risk for developing CRC, compared with relatives of CRC-free individuals. Four percent of first-degree relatives of patients with synchronous or metachronous cancer developed CRC at younger ages than the age recommended for initiating CRC screening (based on familial risk), and therefore would not have been screened. CONCLUSIONS Of patients diagnosed with CRC, 2.3% are found to have synchronous lesions or develop metachronous CRC during follow-up evaluation. Relatives of these patients have a greater risk of CRC than those without a family history of CRC. These results highlight the importance of obtaining a thorough family history and adhering strictly to surveillance guidelines during management of high-risk patients.

Convection enhanced delivery of cisplatin-loaded brain penetrating nanoparticles cures malignant glioma in rats.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is highly invasive and uniformly fatal, with median survival<20months after diagnosis even with the most aggressive treatment that includes surgery, radiation, and systemic chemotherapy. Cisplatin is a particularly potent chemotherapeutic agent, but its use to treat GBM is limited by severe systemic toxicity and inefficient penetration of brain tumor tissue even when it is placed directly in the brain within standard delivery systems. We describe the development of cisplatin-loaded nanoparticles that are small enough (70nm in diameter) to move within the porous extracellular matrix between cells and that possess a dense polyethylene glycol (PEG) corona that prevents them from being trapped by adhesion as they move through the brain tumor parenchyma. As a result, these "brain penetrating nanoparticles" penetrate much deeper into brain tumor tissue compared to nanoparticles without a dense PEG corona following local administration by either manual injection or convection enhanced delivery. The nanoparticles also provide controlled release of cisplatin in effective concentrations to kill the tumor cells that they reach without causing toxicity-related deaths that were observed when cisplatin was infused into the brain without a delivery system. Median survival time of rats bearing orthotopic glioma was significantly enhanced when cisplatin was delivered in brain penetrating nanoparticles (median survival not reached; 80% long-term survivors) compared to cisplatin in conventional un-PEGylated particles (median survival=40days), cisplatin alone (median survival=12days) or saline-treated controls (median survival=28days).

Utility of lateral flow tests in SARS-CoV-2 infection monitorization.

OBJECTIVE The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for medical and public health reasons, to allow the best treatment of cases and the best control of the pandemic. Serology testing allows for the detection of asymptomatic infections and 19-COVID cases once the virus has been cleared. We analyzed the usefulness of the SARS-CoV-2 rapid test of Autobio and tried to correlate its pattern with the severity of COVID19 infection. METHODS We analyzed the accuracy and clinical usefulness of a point-of-care IgM and/or IgG test for SARS-CoV-2 in 35 COVID-19 patients [12 (34.3%) mild-moderate and 23 (65.7%) severe-critical] admitted to a field hospital in Madrid, as well as in 5 controls. RESULTS The mean time from the first day of symptoms to the antibody test was 28 days (SD: 8.7), similar according to the severity of the disease. All patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ showed the corresponding IgG positivity, while these results were negative in all control individuals. A total of 26 (74%) cases also presented with positive IgM, 19 (83%) were severe-critical cases and 7 (58%) were mild-moderate cases. The IgM response lasted longer in the severe critical cases (mean: 29.7 days; SD: 8.4) compared to the moderate cases (mean: 21.2 days; SD: 2.0).. CONCLUSIONS Rapid serology tests are useful for the diagnosis of patients with COVID-19 (mainly IgG detection) and may also be correlated with the severity of the infection (based on IgM detection).

Two Years of Viral Metagenomics in a Tertiary Diagnostics Unit: Evaluation of the First 105 Cases.

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) can capture the full spectrum of viral pathogens in a specimen and has the potential to become an all-in-one solution for virus diagnostics. To date, clinical application is still in an early phase and limitations remain. Here, we evaluated the impact of viral mNGS for cases analyzed over two years in a tertiary diagnostics unit. High throughput mNGS was performed upon request by the treating clinician in cases where the etiology of infection remained unknown or the initial differential diagnosis was very broad. The results were compared to conventional routine testing regarding outcome and workload. In total, 163 specimens from 105 patients were sequenced. The main sample types were cerebrospinal fluid (34%), blood (33%) and throat swabs (10%). In the majority of the cases, viral encephalitis/meningitis or respiratory infection was suspected. In parallel, conventional virus diagnostic tests were performed (mean 18.5 individually probed targets/patients). mNGS detected viruses in 34 cases (32%). While often confirmatory, in multiple cases, the identified viruses were not included in the selected routine diagnostic tests. Two years of mNGS in a tertiary diagnostics unit demonstrated the advantages of a single, untargeted approach for comprehensive, rapid and efficient virus diagnostics, confirming the utility of mNGS in complementing current routine tests.

Comprehensive characterization of mainstream marijuana and tobacco smoke.

Recent increases in marijuana use and legalization without adequate knowledge of the risks necessitate the characterization of the billions of nanoparticles contained in each puff of smoke. Tobacco smoke offers a benchmark given that it has been extensively studied. Tobacco and marijuana smoke particles are quantitatively similar in volatility, shape, density and number concentration, albeit with differences in size, total mass and chemical composition. Particles from marijuana smoke are on average 29% larger in mobility diameter than particles from tobacco smoke and contain 3.4× more total mass. New measurements of semi-volatile fractions determine over 97% of the mass and volume of the particles from either smoke source are comprised of semi-volatile compounds. For tobacco and marijuana smoke, respectively, 4350 and 2575 different compounds are detected, of which, 670 and 536 (231 in common) are tentatively identified, and of these, 173 and 110 different compounds (69 in common) are known to cause negative health effects through carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, or other toxic mechanisms. This study demonstrates striking similarities between marijuana and tobacco smoke in terms of their physical and chemical properties.

Feline abdominal ultrasonography: what's normal? what's abnormal? The kidneys and perinephric space.

PRACTICAL RELEVANCE Abdominal ultrasound plays a vital role in the diagnostic work-up of many cats presenting to general and specialist practitioners. Ultrasound examination of the kidneys and perinephric space can provide important information on several conditions including chronic renal disease, hydronephrosis and perinephric pseudocyst formation. CLINICAL CHALLENGES Despite ultrasonography being a commonly used modality, many practitioners are not comfortable performing an ultrasound examination or interpreting the resulting images. Even for the experienced ultrasonographer, differentiating between incidental findings, such as a medullary rim sign, and pathological changes can be challenging. AIM This review, part of an occasional series on feline abdominal ultrasonography, discusses ultrasonographic examination of the normal and diseased kidney and perinephric space. Aimed at general practitioners who wish to improve their knowledge of and confidence in feline abdominal ultrasound, this review is accompanied by high-resolution images and videos available online as supplementary material. A subsequent article will address ultrasonography of the collecting system including the renal pelvis and urinary bladder. EQUIPMENT Ultrasound facilities are readily available to most practitioners, although use of ultrasonography as a diagnostic tool is highly dependent on operator experience. EVIDENCE BASE Information provided in this article is drawn from the published literature and the author's own clinical experience.

Poly(dopamine)-assisted immobilization of Arg-Gly-Asp peptides, hydroxyapatite, and bone morphogenic protein-2 on titanium to improve the osteogenesis of bone marrow stem cells.

Osteointegration of titanium implants in bone defects is clinically important for long-term performance of orthopaedic implants. In this work, we developed a facile and effective "one-pot" deposition method based on dopamine polymerization for the development of cell-adhesive, osteoconductive, and osteoinductive titanium implants. Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-conjugated polymers, hydroxyapatite (HAp) nanoparticles, and bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) were mixed with an alkaline dopamine solution, and then, titanium substrates were immersed in the mixture for an hour. During poly(dopamine) coating, the three types of bioactive substances were immobilized on the titanium surfaces. Our results indicate that RGD conjugation enhanced the adhesion of human bone marrow stem cell line, while HAp incorporation facilitated cellular osteodifferentiation. The immobilization of BMP-2 induced the osteogenesis of the stem cells, indicated by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The mineralization on the deposited substrates was also enhanced greatly. This functionalized layer on titanium substrate promoted mesenchymal stem cell to osteoblast and improved osteogenic differentiation and mineralization. In conclusion, the surface modification method shows a great potential for enhancement of osteointegration of orthopaedic and dental implants.

Closed reduction of distal radius fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Distal radius fractures (DRF) are a common injury, especially in the elderly.Displaced fractures can be reduced by closed reduction through several techniques, two of which are compared in this systematic review and meta-analysis.Closed reduction by finger-trap traction (FTT) seems to offer better correction of radial shortening. Additionally, there may be less pain and fewer complications associated with this technique.Closed reduction by manual traction seems to offer better correction of the dorsal tilt.Further research is needed to fully determine the optimal method of closed reduction.

Bovine respiratory disease complex associated mortality and morbidity rates in feedlot cattle from southeastern Brazil.

INTRODUCTION A feedlot is an intensive farming system for finishing livestock. Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a cause of morbidity and mortality in beef cattle, especially in feedlots. METHODOLOGY This study investigated the morbidity and mortality of BRD in a beef cattle feedlot in southeastern Brazil using: clinical diagnoses, therapy, morbidity, and mortality. Pulmonary fragments were collected from five steers, on feed from 3-32 days, with lesions of pneumonia for identification of BRD infectious agents PCR. RESULTS 188,862 steers were on feed and morbidity was 7.05% (13,315/188,862), mortality 0.64% (1,214/188,862). The causes of morbidity were: BRD (6.13%), lameness (0.29%), trauma (0.21%), clostridiosis (0.13%) and polioencephalomalacia, PEM (0.12%). The causes of mortality were: BRD (0.21%), trauma (0.17%), and clostridiosis (0.13%). When all sick cattle were considered (n=13,315), BRD (86.9%) was the principal cause of morbidity, followed by lameness (4.13%), trauma (3.05%), and clostridiosis (1.82%). The cost of BRD-associated cattle mortality and morbidity was estimated at $14,334.00/10,000 and $16,315.40/10,000 respectively. It was projected that the economic effects due to BRD-associated morbidity in Brazil were $6.31 million/annum, while losses due to mortality were $5.54 million, resulting in an annual loss of $11.85 million. Coinfections in cattle with pneumonia due to Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida were identified in 4/5 steers tested. CONCLUSIONS This is the first longitudinal study that investigated the incidence of BRD in feedlot cattle from Brazil, and the results herein described indicate that BRD contributed significantly to the development of mortality and morbidity of cattle on feed.

CXCR2-positive neutrophils are essential for cuprizone-induced demyelination: relevance to multiple sclerosis.

Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the CNS. Recent studies have suggested diverse mechanisms as underlying demyelination, including a subset of lesions induced by an interaction between metabolic insult to oligodendrocytes and inflammatory mediators. For mice of susceptible strains, cuprizone feeding results in oligodendrocyte cell loss and demyelination of the corpus callosum. Remyelination ensues and has been extensively studied. Cuprizone-induced demyelination remains incompletely characterized. We found that mice lacking the type 2 CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR2) were relatively resistant to cuprizone-induced demyelination and that circulating CXCR2-positive neutrophils were important for cuprizone-induced demyelination. Our findings support a two-hit process of cuprizone-induced demyelination, supporting the idea that multiple sclerosis pathogenesis features extensive oligodendrocyte cell loss. These data suggest that cuprizone-induced demyelination is useful for modeling certain aspects of multiple sclerosis pathogenesis.

Systematic Review of Community- and Home-Based Interventions to Support Parenting and Reduce Risk of Child Maltreatment Among Families With Substance-Exposed Newborns.

Substance-exposed newborns (SENs) are at increased risk of child maltreatment, out-of-home placement, and poor health and developmental outcomes. The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesize existing research on community- and home-based interventions designed to improve parenting and reduce risk of maltreatment for families with SENs, applying a program logic framework. The review includes studies that used preexperimental, quasi-experimental, and experimental designs. Twelve interventions were identified. Of the nine studies that used more rigorous experimental or quasi-experimental designs, five showed positive effects on at least one parenting or child maltreatment outcome, although some studies showed high risk of bias. Full coherence among the intended participants, theory of change, and program components was observed for only two interventions. The findings suggest a need for more rigorous research to develop and test interventions that are grounded in theory and prior research and that address the unique needs of families with SENs.

Laparoscopic reversal of Hartmann's procedure.

Reversal of Hartmann's procedure is a major surgical procedure associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Because of the difficulty of the procedure, laparoscopic reversal of Hartmann's procedure is not well established. We describe our experience with this laparoscopic procedure to assess its difficulty and safety. Five patients (4 men and 1 woman) underwent laparoscopic reversal of Hartmann's procedure (LRHP). The initial surgeries were performed to manage obstructive colorectal cancer for 4 patients, and rectovesical fistula for one patient. The procedure was laparoscopically completed for 4 patients. Conversion to open laparotomy was required for one patient, secondary to massive adhesion in lower abdomen. Transient ileostomies were made in 2 cases. Operative time ranged from 240 to 545 minutes. There was no operative mortality. LRHP can be performed safely by an experienced surgeon. However, it is still technically challenging and time consuming.

[Pathogen reduction for platelets: available techniques and recent developments].

The will to reach for blood components a microbiological safety comparable to that of plasma-derived drugs led to the development of numerous pathogen reduction research programs for red blood cells and\or platelets in the 1990s. A consensus conference organized in 2007 allowed to define the main steps and precautions to be taken for the implementation of these processes. In the specific case of platelet concentrates, three processes stay this day in the run, even if they are not at the same development stage. A process using ultraviolet C only is at the stage of preclinical studies. The Mirasol® process, based on the activation of riboflavin by exposure to ultraviolet A and ultraviolet B is CE marked (class IIb), and a clinical study was published in 2010. The Intercept® process, involving the activation of a psoralen molecule by exposure to ultraviolet A, is CE marked (class III) since 2002, and has been licensed in France since 2005, in Germany since 2005 and in Switzerland since 2010. At least 12 clinical studies have been published. In regard to this last pathogen reduction process, the medical and scientific documentation, from in vitro investigations to post-marketing observational studies, is much more developed than the corresponding documentation of some innovative processes at the time of their generalization, such as the SAG-mannitol solution for red cell concentrates in 1979, leukoreduction filters for platelets and red cells concentrates in the 1990s, the solvent detergent therapeutic plasma in 1992 or the methylene blue therapeutic plasma in 2006.

Creation of a percutaneous mesocaval shunt to control variceal bleeding in a child.

Although transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement is the standard procedure for the treatment of portal hypertension, it is often impossible to perform in patients with extrahepatic portal vein occlusion. In these patients, options for decompressing the liver are few. In this report, we present a novel solution for managing gastro-esophageal hemorrhage in a child with portal hypertension and extrahepatic portal vein occlusion, through the creation of a percutaneous mesocaval shunt.

Use of human immunoglobulins as an anti-infective treatment: the experience so far and their possible re-emerging role.

INTRODUCTION Pooled human immunoglobulins (IGs) are prepared from plasma obtained from healthy donors as a concentrated antibody-containing solution. In addition, high-titer IGs (hyperimmune) against a specific pathogen can be obtained from vaccinated or convalescing donors. Currently, IGs can be used for the treatment of a variety of infections for which no specific therapy exists or that remain difficult to treat. Moreover, the recent pathogen outbreaks for which there is no approved treatment have renewed attention to the role of convalescent plasma and IGs. Areas covered: In this review, a historical perspective of the use of sera and IGs in humans as anti-infective agents (any viral, bacterial, parasitic infection), excluding immunodeficient patients, is presented from early development to the latest clinical studies. A Medline search was conducted to examine the peer-reviewed literature, with no date limits. Expert commentary: Human pooled plasma-derived IG products benefit from the polyclonal response of every individual donor and from the interindividual variability in such response. The trend to increased availability of vaccines for infectious diseases also opens new potential applications of hyperimmune IGs for emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases (e.g.: Ebola, Zika, Dengue), for the prevention and treatment in the general population, healthcare personnel and caregivers.

Epstein-barr virus encodes three bona fide ubiquitin-specific proteases.

Manipulation of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is emerging as a common theme in viral pathogenesis. Some viruses have been shown to encode functional homologs of UPS enzymes, suggesting that a systematic identification of these products may provide new insights into virus-host cell interactions. Ubiquitin-specific proteases, collectively known as deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), regulate the activity of the UPS by hydrolyzing ubiquitin peptide or isopeptide bonds. The prediction of viral DUBs based on sequence similarity with known enzymes is hampered by the diversity of viral genomes. In this study sequence alignments, pattern searches, and hidden Markov models were developed for the conserved C- and H-boxes of the known DUB families and used to search the open reading frames (ORFs) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a large gammaherpesvirus that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a broad spectrum of human malignancies of lymphoid and epithelial cell origin. The searches identified a limited number of EBV ORFs that contain putative DUB catalytic domains. DUB activity was confirmed by functional assays and mutation analysis for three high scoring candidates, supporting the usefulness of this bioinformatics approach in predicting distant homologues of cellular enzymes.

Ex vivo pneumostasis evaluation of a variable-height staple design.

OBJECTIVE This study examined the effect of using a variable-height staple construct containing three rows of staples with heights of 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 mm (staple leg length, medial to lateral) versus standard three-row single-height staplers (with staple heights of either 3.5 or 4.8 mm) for pneumostasis in healthy porcine and canine lung parenchyma to determine whether a single stapler that uses variable staple heights could perform as well as, or better than, existing single-height stapling devices. The work presented here used healthy animal tissues, in lieu of diseased tissue, which is extremely difficult to obtain and quantify. METHODS Briefly, fresh explanted porcine and canine trachea-lung blocs were used for all testing. Tissue thicknesses were measured with a custom-design spring-loaded caliper before stapling with control and test articles to ensure that the tissue was of "appropriate" thickness for the stapler size (staple height) selected (per manufacturer's instructions for use). All tissue measurements were comparable across each area of lung tested, and both test and control devices were fired into the same tissue thicknesses. After stapling, the lungs were submerged in water, insufflated, checked for air leaks at four discrete (increasing) pressures, and scored using a predetermined scale. Statistical analysis was performed for n = 26 (3.5-mm staples), n = 29 (4.8-mm staples), and n = 26 or 29 (paired to the standard group) for the variable-height stapler (3.0-, 3.5-, and 4.0-mm staples). RESULTS The results demonstrated that the test article comprising three rows of variable-height staples provided comparable pneumostasis with the standard three-row single-height staplers (with staple heights of either 3.5 or 4.8 mm) under the test conditions described. CONCLUSIONS A novel test article containing three rows of staples with heights of 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 mm (variable-height stapler) showed promising results when compared with standard commercially available single-height staplers, performing as well as or better than the standard single-height staplers. This work demonstrates important first steps to proving equivalent device performance, which might facilitate the use of a variable-height stapler in place of multiple single-height staplers.

Dose optimized chest CT for diagnosis of COVID-19 - Evaluation of the image quality and diagnostic impact.

OBJECTIVES The detection of COVID-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has varying sensitivity. CT of the chest can verify the infection in patients with clinical symptoms and a negative test result accelerating treatment and actions to prevent further contagion. However, CT employs ionizing radiation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate protocol settings, associated radiation exposure, image quality and diagnostic performance of a low-dose CT protocol in a university hospital setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chest-CT examinations were performed on a single scanner (Somatom Definition Edge, Siemens Healthineers, Germany) in 105 symptomatic patients (60 male, 45 female). Images were evaluated with regard to protocol parameters, image quality, radiation exposure and diagnostic accuracy. Serial RT-PCR served as the standard of reference. Based on this reference standard sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of CT with 95% confidence interval were calculated. RESULTS The mean effective dose was 1.3 ± 0.4 mSv (0.7 - 2.9 mSv) for the patient cohort (mean age 66.6 ± 16.7 years (19-94 years), mean BMI 26.6 ± 5.3 kg/m² (16-46 kg/m²)). A sensitivity of 100 [95% CI: 82-100]%, a specificity of 78 [95% CI: 68-86]%, a positive predictive value of 50 [95% CI: 33-67]% and a negative predictive value of 100 [95% CI: 95-100]% were obtained. No COVID-19 diagnoses were missed by CT. Image noise did not strongly correlate with BMI or patient diameter and was rated as average. CONCLUSIONS We presented a robust imaging procedure with a chest CT protocol for confident diagnosis of COVID-19. Even for an overweight patient cohort, an associated radiation exposure of only 1.3 ± 0.4 mSv was achieved with sufficient diagnostic quality to exclude COVID-19.

Partially Uncleaved Alphavirus Replicase Forms Spherule Structures in the Presence and Absence of RNA Template.

Alphaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses expressing their replicase as a polyprotein, P1234, which is cleaved to four final products, nonstructural proteins nsP1 to nsP4. The replicase proteins together with viral RNA and host factors form membrane invaginations termed spherules, which act as the replication complexes producing progeny RNAs. We have previously shown that the wild-type alphavirus replicase requires a functional RNA template and active polymerase to generate spherule structures. However, we now find that specific partially processed forms of the replicase proteins alone can give rise to membrane invaginations in the absence of RNA or replication. The minimal requirement for spherule formation was the expression of properly cleaved nsP4, together with either uncleaved P123 or with the combination of nsP1 and uncleaved P23. These inactive spherules were morphologically less regular than replication-induced spherules. In the presence of template, nsP1 plus uncleaved P23 plus nsP4 could efficiently assemble active replication spherules producing both negative-sense and positive-sense RNA strands. P23 alone did not have membrane affinity, but could be recruited to membrane sites in the presence of nsP1 and nsP4. These results define the set of viral components required for alphavirus replication complex assembly and suggest the possibility that it could be reconstituted from separately expressed nonstructural proteins.IMPORTANCE All positive-strand RNA viruses extensively modify host cell membranes to serve as efficient platforms for viral RNA replication. Alphaviruses and several other groups induce protective membrane invaginations (spherules) as their genome factories. Most positive-strand viruses produce their replicase as a polyprotein precursor, which is further processed through precise and regulated cleavages. We show here that specific cleavage intermediates of the alphavirus replicase can give rise to spherule structures in the absence of viral RNA. In the presence of template RNA, the same intermediates yield active replication complexes. Thus, partially cleaved replicase proteins play key roles that connect replication complex assembly, membrane deformation, and the different stages of RNA synthesis.

Treatment of concomitant prolapse and stress urinary incontinence via a transobturator subvesical mesh without independent suburethral tape.

OBJECTIVE Evaluate the efficacy of a transobturator subvesical mesh for cystocele in concomitant stress urinary incontinence (SUI). DESIGN Longitudinal observational study. SETTING Tertiary referral urogynecology center. POPULATION One hundred and five women with at least an anterior vaginal wall prolapse and concomitant SUI who underwent surgery. METHODS After reduction of prolapse elements, the intervention consisted of a non-absorbable monoprosthesis placement with two transobturator expansions and, if necessary, associated hysterectomy or infraccocygeal sacropexy. No specific procedure was performed for SUI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES All patients had a physical examination and a subjective symptoms assessment via questionnaire in the preoperative period and at one-year or more after surgery. The pelvic organ prolapse quantification system was used for anatomical results. For SUI, Ingelman-Sundberg classification and cough test were used. Loss of urine was measured by a one-hour pad test. Functional results were evaluated by visual analog scale, quality-of-life questionnaires, including the pelvic floor distress inventory and the pelvic floor impact questionnaire. RESULTS Median follow-up was 45 months (range: 12-72). A total of 102 women (97%) were cured of their prolapse, of whom 72 (69%) were cured of their SUI and 13 (12%) showed improvement. Pad test, visual analogic scale and quality-of-life questionnaires were all improved (p < 0.05). Complications consisted of one rectal injury, one transitory urinary retention, and two hematomas. Of the erosions 6% was observed for monofilament polypropylene prostheses. CONCLUSION Transvaginal monoprosthesis for the simultaneous correction of prolapse and SUI represents an effective treatment for bulky or recurrent prolapse as well as posthysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse.

Adequate union rates for the treatment of acute proximal fifth metatarsal fractures.

PURPOSE To compare the bone healing, clinical, and return to daily activity outcomes after either surgical or conservative management of acute zone 1, 2, and 3 fifth metatarsal fractures. METHODS A literature search was performed to identify studies published from the earliest record to January 2019 using EMBASE (Ovid), MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science. All articles assessing clinical outcomes of acute proximal fifth metatarsal fractures were included. Bone healing and clinical outcomes were thereafter calculated using a simplified pooling method. RESULTS Thirty-two articles comprising of a total of 1,239 fractures were included, of which one was a randomized controlled trial, seven were prospective studies, and 24 were retrospective studies. 627 zone 1 fractures demonstrated union rates of 93.2% following conservative treatment and 95.1% following surgical treatment. Conservatively managed zone 1 fractures were displaced 49.5% of the time, compared to a rate of 92.8% for the surgically treated cases. For Jones' (zone 2) fractures, bone healing outcomes of conservative versus surgical treatment showed union rates of 77.4% versus 96.3%, refracture rates of 2.4% versus 2.1%, and mean time to union of 11.0 weeks versus 9.4 weeks, respectively. Only ten proximal diaphyseal (zone 3) fractures were reported, with a mean return to work of 8.2 weeks. CONCLUSION Acute zone 1 fractures are preferably treated conservatively as similar union rates were found after both conservative and surgical management. In contradistinction, acute zone 2 fractures demonstrate higher union rates and faster time to union when treated surgically. The outcomes of acute zone 3 fractures are rarely reported in the literature, so treatment recommendations remain unclear. Further research of proximal fifth metatarsal fractures is warranted to provide more definitive conclusions, but current findings can aid surgeons during the shared clinical decision making process. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV.

Local immunomodulation combined to radiofrequency ablation results in a complete cure of local and distant colorectal carcinoma.

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of colorectal liver metastases activates a specific T-cell response that is ineffective in avoiding recurrence. Recently, local immunomodulation garnered interests as a way to improve the immune response. We were interested in improving the RFA immune response priming to propose a curative treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) based on antitumor immunity. First, we demonstrated that the RFA did not increase the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in secondary distant tumors of patients and in mice model and could not avoid relapse. Remarkably, RFA and in situ immunomodulation with GM-CSF-BCG hydrogel induced complete cure of microscopic secondary lesions in mice, related to a strong specific immune response. Then, we demonstrated that the immune escape of large secondary lesions was reversed by addition of the systemic PD-1 blockade to the in situ immunomodulation. The lack of an effective distant immune response in patients treated with RFA confirmed the relevance of this new combination strategy. Increasing the in situ priming response of radiofrequency ablation provides effective adjuvants to induce an abscopal effect. In the case of large lesions, synergy between PD1 blockade inhibitor, ineffective alone or after single RFA, with in situ immunomodulation, could lead to reconsideration of the use of checkpoint inhibition in metastatic MSS CRC.

A rare approach to entero-atmospheric fistula.

PATIENT Female, 60 FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent incisional hernia Symptoms: - MEDICATION - Clinical Procedure: Limited ileo-cecal resection Specialty: Surgery. OBJECTIVE Diagnostic/therapeutic accidents. BACKGROUND Iatrogenic entero-atmospheric fistula is devastating and its management is extremely difficult because it is often associated with fluid and electrolyte disturbances, nutritional problems, and life-threatening sepsis. CASE REPORT A 60-year-old woman underwent laparoscopic repair of a recurrent incisional hernia that was complicated by iatrogenic cecal injury necessitating a limited ileocecal resection and onlay prosthetic mesh repair of the hernia. Postoperatively, sloughing of the overlying skin led to mesh exposure. An attempted rotational flap coverage was complicated by small bowel injury, which was recognized and repaired. However, an entero-atmospheric fistula developed after the removal of contaminated mesh. The fistula was initially treated by vacuum-assisted closure dressing and later was converted to a 'stoma'. Six months later, the small bowel segment bearing the fistula was excised and bowel continuity was restored. CONCLUSIONS In selected cases, the conversion of entero-atmospheric fistula to a 'stoma' allows the patient to be discharged home early and maintain good nutritional status while awaiting the definitive surgical intervention.

Bioterrorism: a laboratory who does it?

In October 2001, the first disseminated biological warfare attack was perpetrated on American soil. Initially, a few clinical microbiology laboratories were testing specimens from acutely ill patients and also being asked to test nasal swabs from the potentially exposed. Soon after, a significant number of clinical microbiology and public health laboratories received similar requests to test the worried well or evaluate potentially contaminated mail or environmental materials, sometimes from their own break rooms. The role of the clinical and public health microbiology laboratory in response to a select agent event or act of bioterrorism is reviewed.

Impact of Chest Wall Modifications and Lung Injury on the Correspondence Between Airway and Transpulmonary Driving Pressures.

OBJECTIVE Recent interest has arisen in airway driving pressure (DP(AW)), the quotient of tidal volume (V(T)), and respiratory system compliance (C(RS)), which could serve as a direct and easily measured marker for ventilator-induced lung injury risk. We aimed to test the correspondence between DP(AW) and transpulmonary driving pressure (DP(TP))-the quotient of V(T) and lung compliance (C(L)), in response to intra-abdominal hypertension and changes in positive end-expiratory pressure during different models of lung pathology. DESIGN Well-controlled experimental setting that allowed reversible modification of chest wall compliance (C(CW)) in a variety of models of lung pathology. SETTING Large animal laboratory of a university-affiliated hospital. SUBJECTS Ten deeply anesthetized swine. INTERVENTIONS Application of intra-abdominal pressures of 0 and 20 cm H2O at positive end-expiratory pressure of 1 and 10 cm H2O, under volume-controlled mechanical ventilation in the settings of normal lungs (baseline), unilateral whole-lung atelectasis, and unilateral and bilateral lung injuries caused by saline lavage. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Pulmonary mechanics including esophageal pressure and calculations of DP(AW), DP(TP), C(RS), C(L), and C(CW). When compared with normal intra-abdominal pressures, intra-abdominal hypertension increased DP(AW), during both "normal lung conditions" (p < 0.0001) and "unilateral atelectasis" (p = 0.0026). In contrast, DP(TP) remained virtually unaffected by changes in positive end-expiratory pressure or intra-abdominal pressures in both conditions. During unilateral lung injury, both DPA(W) and DP(TP) were increased by the presence of intra-abdominal hypertension (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0222, respectively). During bilateral lung injury, intra-abdominal hypertension increased both DP(AW) (at positive end-expiratory pressure of 1 cm H2O, p < 0.0001; and at positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cm H2O, p = 0.0091) and DP(TP) (at positive end-expiratory pressure of 1 cm H2O, p = 0.0510; and at positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cm H2O, p = 0.0335). CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate that DP(AW) is influenced by reductions in chest wall compliance and by underlying lung properties. As with other measures of pulmonary mechanics that are based on unmodified P(AW), caution is advised in attempting to attribute hazard or safety to any specific absolute value of DP(AW).

Physical Fitness Training in Patients with Subacute Stroke (PHYS-STROKE): multicentre, randomised controlled, endpoint blinded trial.

OBJECTIVE To determine the safety and efficacy of aerobic exercise on activities of daily living in the subacute phase after stroke. DESIGN Multicentre, randomised controlled, endpoint blinded trial. SETTING Seven inpatient rehabilitation sites in Germany (2013-17). PARTICIPANTS 200 adults with subacute stroke (days 5-45 after stroke) with a median National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS, range 0-42 points, higher values indicating more severe strokes) score of 8 (interquartile range 5-12) were randomly assigned (1:1) to aerobic physical fitness training (n=105) or relaxation sessions (n=95, control group) in addition to standard care. INTERVENTION Participants received either aerobic, bodyweight supported, treadmill based physical fitness training or relaxation sessions, each for 25 minutes, five times weekly for four weeks, in addition to standard rehabilitation therapy. Investigators and endpoint assessors were masked to treatment assignment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcomes were change in maximal walking speed (m/s) in the 10 m walking test and change in Barthel index scores (range 0-100 points, higher scores indicating less disability) three months after stroke compared with baseline. Safety outcomes were recurrent cardiovascular events, including stroke, hospital readmissions, and death within three months after stroke. Efficacy was tested with analysis of covariance for each primary outcome in the full analysis set. Multiple imputation was used to account for missing values. RESULTS Compared with relaxation, aerobic physical fitness training did not result in a significantly higher mean change in maximal walking speed (adjusted treatment effect 0.1 m/s (95% confidence interval 0.0 to 0.2 m/s), P=0.23) or mean change in Barthel index score (0 (-5 to 5), P=0.99) at three months after stroke. A higher rate of serious adverse events was observed in the aerobic group compared with relaxation group (incidence rate ratio 1.81, 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 3.36). CONCLUSIONS Among moderately to severely affected adults with subacute stroke, aerobic bodyweight supported, treadmill based physical fitness training was not superior to relaxation sessions for maximal walking speed and Barthel index score but did suggest higher rates of adverse events. These results do not appear to support the use of aerobic bodyweight supported fitness training in people with subacute stroke to improve activities of daily living or maximal walking speed and should be considered in future guidelines.

Increased Risk of Colorectal Cancer Among Family Members of All Ages, Regardless of Age of Index Case at Diagnosis.

BACKGROUND & AIMS It is not clear whether familial risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) varies with age of index CRC patients or their relatives. We quantified the risk of CRC in first-degree relatives (FDRs), second-degree relatives, and first-cousin relatives of individuals with CRC, stratified by ages and sexes of index patients and ages of relatives. METHODS CRCs diagnosed between 1980 and 2010 were identified from the Utah Cancer Registry and linked to pedigrees from the Utah Population Database. Age- and sex-matched CRC-free individuals were selected to form the comparison group. CRC risk in relatives was determined by Cox regression analysis. RESULTS Of 18,208 index patients diagnosed with CRC, the highest familial risk was observed in FDRs of index CRC patients who were diagnosed at an age younger than 40 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-3.79). However, familial risk was increased in FDRs even when the index case was diagnosed with cancer at an advanced age (>80 years; HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.59-1.94). Ages of relatives and ages of index cases of CRC each affected familial cancer risk; the highest risk was found in young relatives (<50 years) of individuals with early-onset CRC (<40 years; HR, 7.0; 95% CI, 2.86-17.09). CONCLUSIONS All relatives of individuals with CRC are at increased risk for this cancer, regardless of the age of diagnosis of the index patient. Although risk is greatest among young relatives of early-onset CRC cases, relatives of patients diagnosed at advanced ages also have an increased risk.

Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair.

Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) has established itself as a well-accepted option in the treatment of hernias. Clear benefits have been established regarding the superiority of LVHR in terms of fewer wound infections compared with open repairs. Meticulous technique and appropriate patient selection are critical to obtain the reported results.

Bioabsorbable hernia plugs in laparoscopic inguinal herniorraphy: short-term and long-term results.

PURPOSE To report our short-term and long-term experience with laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR) using a bioabsorbable plug. METHODS Patients who underwent LIHR from 2009 to 2011 using a bioabsorbable plug and synthetic mesh patch were reviewed retrospectively. Short-term follow-up information was obtained within 30 days of surgery, whereas long-term follow-up was obtained in 2014. Quality of life was assessed using the Carolinas Comfort Scale. RESULTS Forty-four patients (43 male), including 6 (13.6%) with recurrent disease, underwent 52 LIHR with a bioabsorbable plug. Mean age and body mass index were 60.9 ± 10.5 years and 27.9 ± 4.7 kg/m, respectively. Among 39 (88.6%) patients available for short-term follow-up, early postoperative complications were seen in 10 (25.6%) patients, all of which resolved spontaneously. Mean long-term follow-up duration was 41.6 ± 4.1 months, among 30 (68.2%) patients (40 hernia repairs). There were 2 (5%) hernia recurrences, with 1 requiring a reoperation 12 months after initial repair. Only 2 (6.7%) patients reported moderate or bothersome chronic pain. CONCLUSIONS Bioabsorbable plug combined with a synthetic mesh is safe and effective for use during LIHR. The technique offers an acceptable incidence of chronic pain and recurrence.

The Glubran 2 glue for mesh fixation in Lichtenstein's hernia repair: a double-blind randomized study.

INTRODUCTION With an average incidence rate of 11%, chronic pain is considered the most serious complication of inguinal hernioplasty after surgical site infection. One of the proposed solutions to this problem is to use tissue adhesive for mesh fixation, which helps prevent nerve and tissue damage. AIM The goal of this study was to compare mesh fixation with the use of sutures vs. adhesive in Lichtenstein's inguinal hernia repair in a randomized, double-blind one-center study. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study group consisted of 41 males with primary inguinal hernia undergoing Lichtenstein's repair (20 - adhesive; 21 - suture) and remaining in follow-up from July 2008 to November 2010. Randomization took place during the operation. The follow-up was performed by one surgeon (blinded) according to a pre-agreed schedule; the end-of-study unblinding was performed during the last follow-up visit, usually 16 months postoperatively. RESULTS In 1 patient from the "adhesive" group, a recurrence was observed one year after the initial repair. The early postoperative pain was less intense in this group. In later postoperative periods the method of mesh fixation had no influence on the pain experienced by the patient. Other complications were not correlated with the method of mesh fixation. CONCLUSIONS In this randomized, one-center double-blind clinical study of males with primary inguinal hernia it has been show during follow-up that the use of Glubran 2 cyanoacrylate adhesive for mesh implant fixation yields similar recurrence and chronic pain rates as the classical suture technique. In the early postoperative period, the pain reported by these patients was relatively weaker; patients undergoing adhesive mesh fixation experienced a quicker return to daily household activities.

Feasibility and analgesic efficacy of the transversus abdominis plane block after single-port laparoscopy in patients having bariatric surgery.

PURPOSE The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a technique increasingly used for analgesia after surgery on the anterior abdominal wall. We undertook this study to determine the feasibility and analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided TAP blocks in morbidly obese patients. We describe the dermatomal spread of local anesthetic in TAP blocks administered, and test the hypothesis that TAP blocks decrease visual analog scale (VAS) scores. PATIENTS AND METHODS After ethics committee approval and informed consent, 35 patients with body mass index >35 undergoing single-port sleeve gastrectomy (SPSG) were enrolled. All patients received balanced general anesthesia, followed by intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA; hydromorphone) postoperatively; all reported VAS >3 upon arrival to the recovery room. From the cohort of 35 patients having single-port laparoscopy (SPL), a sealed envelope method was used to randomly select ten patients to the TAP group and 25 patients to the control group. The ten patients in the TAP group received ultrasound-guided TAP blocks with 30 mL of 0.2% Ropivacaine injected bilaterally. The dermatomal distribution of the sensory block (by pinprick test) was recorded. VAS scores for the first 24 hours after surgery and opioid use were compared between the IV-PCA+TAP block and IV-PCA only groups. RESULTS Sensory block ranged from T5-L1. Mean VAS pain scores decreased from 8 ± 2 to 4 ± 3 (P=0.04) within 30 minutes of TAP block administration. Compared with patients given IV-PCA only, significantly fewer patients who received TAP block had moderate or severe pain (VAS 4-10) after block administration at 6 hours and 12 hours post-surgery. However, cumulative consumption of hydromorphone at 24 hours after SPSG surgery was similar for both groups. CONCLUSION Ultrasound-guided TAP blocks in morbidly obese patients are feasible and result in satisfactory analgesia following SPSG in the immediate postoperative period.

New evidence in trauma resuscitation - is 1:1:1 the answer?

Traumatic injury is a common problem, with over five million worldwide deaths from trauma per year. An estimated 10 to 20% of these deaths are potentially preventable with better control of bleeding. Damage control resuscitation involves early delivery of plasma and platelets as a primary resuscitation approach to minimize trauma-induced coagulopathy. Plasma, red blood cell and platelet ratios of 1:1:1 appear to be the best substitution for fresh whole blood; however, the current literature consists only of survivor bias-prone observational studies.

Effect of age on the comparability of bispectral and state entropy indices during the maintenance of propofol-sufentanil anaesthesia.

BACKGROUND Manufacturers recommend maintaining anaesthesia at a bispectral index (BIS) or state entropy (SE) index value between 40 and 60. METHODS We prospectively studied 102 patients receiving propofol-sufentanil anaesthesia administered by anaesthetists blinded to these indices. The main endpoint was crude agreement (P(0)), defined as the proportion of agreement between BIS and SE index among three categories: <40, between 40 and 60, and >60. Discrepancies in recommendation (DR) were also considered. A DR is type 1 if BIS or SE is <40, while the other is simultaneously >60. A DR is type 2 when BIS and SE index values are on different sides of a threshold (40 or 60) with three subtypes according to the magnitude of their difference. A linear multiple regression was performed to identify covariates that are independently associated with P(0). RESULTS In total, 12 147 pairs of values were studied. P(0) was 59.9 (24.5%) [mean (sd)]. Thirty-three patients presented more than 50% discordant pairs and only seven patients presented more than 95% concordant pairs. Type 1 DR occurred in only 1.1% of all the pairs. The median (inter-quartile range) number of type 2 DR varied from 5 (3-8) to 2 (1-3) according to the degree of difference. Multivariate analysis showed that age (P=0.0004) and electrode position (P=0.0084) were independently associated with P(0). An increase in the age of 10 yr decreases P(0) by 5%. CONCLUSIONS The agreement between BIS and SE indices is moderate and deteriorates as patients' age increases. This study cannot determine which index is best adapted for elderly patients. Additional work comparing both indices with raw EEG traces is warranted.

Emergency Center Curbside Screening during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

UNSTRUCTURED Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is a global pandemic that has placed a significant burden on the healthcare systems. Michigan has been one of the top states affected by COVID-19. We described the curbside testing procedure implemented at Beaumont Hospital, a large hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan. We aimed at evaluating its safety and efficiency. We reported on time to medical decision, time spent documenting electronic medical records (EMR), overall time of screening, and emergency center return evaluations. Because of the large volume of patients and testing that was required near the beginning of this pandemic, curbside screening became a safe and efficient way of delivering SARS-CoV-2 testing as it allowed for a medical decision within a median of 15 minutes from arrival. Less than 10% of these patients returned to the emergency center for evaluation at a minimum of 7 days follow up. Our curbside testing model encourages the incorporation of this model at other high-volume facilities during an infectious disease pandemic.

Blessing or curse? Proteomics in granzyme research.

Granzymes (gzms) are a group of serine proteases that play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity, blood coagulation, apoptosis, and inflammation, but are also connected to atherosclerosis, diabetes, cardiovascular and inflammatory lung diseases, cancer, and sepsis. Humans have five gzms (gzms A, B, H, K, and M), which differ in their substrate specificity. It is widely accepted that they are delivered from cytotoxic lymphocytes via perforin into the cytoplasm of target cells where they initiate cell death, modulate cytokine signaling, or inactivate pathogen proteins. However, more recent evidence indicates gzms also act extracellularly in noncytotoxic processes. Proteomic approaches are directed at mapping gzm cleavage specificity, identifying substrates, and unraveling the (patho-) physiological role of these proteases. These studies have refined our understanding of gzm species specificity, and collectively uncovered an enormous number of new substrates. However, with the exception of a very few human gzmB substrates supported by independent data (Bid, DNA-PK, PARP, ICAD, and procaspase 7), it is presently unclear which are physiologically relevant. This review aims to summarize and analyze the different proteomic approaches used and discuss both their convincing and controversial outcomes.

Interferon-γ stimulates p11-dependent surface expression of annexin A2 in lung epithelial cells to enhance phagocytosis.

Annexin A2 (p36) is usually present together with its natural ligand p11 as a heterotetramer complex, which has multiple biological functions depending on its cellular localization. However, the detailed mechanism of annexin A2 translocation and its physiological role in inflammation remain unclear. Here, we show that IFN-γ stimulation enhances surface translocation of annexin A2 on lung epithelial cells. While total annexin A2 protein remains unchanged, the expression of p11 is upregulated via the IFN-γ-activated JAK2/STAT1 signal pathway. Notably, IFN-γ-induced p11 expression is required for annexin A2 translocation to the cell surface. Since annexin A2 lacks a signal peptide for surface translocation by the classical endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi route, its mode of trafficking remains unclear. We observed that p11-dependent surface translocation of annexin A2 is associated with the exosomal secretion pathway. The IFN-γ-induced increase of annexin A2 in the exosomes is blocked in p11-silenced cells. Furthermore, IFN-γ-induced surface expression of annexin A2 mediates phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by lung epithelial cells. These findings provide insights into the surface translocation mechanism of annexin A2 and illustrate a pivotal function of surface annexin A2 in the phagocytic response to IFN-γ.

Molecular characterization of a new species in the genus Alphacoronavirus associated with mink epizootic catarrhal gastroenteritis.

A coronavirus (CoV) previously shown to be associated with catarrhal gastroenteritis in mink (Mustela vison) was identified by electron microscopy in mink faeces from two fur farms in Wisconsin and Minnesota in 1998. A pan-coronavirus and a genus-specific RT-PCR assay were used initially to demonstrate that the newly discovered mink CoVs (MCoVs) were members of the genus Alphacoronavirus. Subsequently, using a random RT-PCR approach, full-genomic sequences were generated that further confirmed that, phylogenetically, the MCoVs belonged to the genus Alphacoronavirus, with closest relatedness to the recently identified but only partially sequenced (fragments of the polymerase, and full-length spike, 3c, envelope, nucleoprotein, membrane, 3x and 7b genes) ferret enteric coronavirus (FRECV) and ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV). The molecular data presented in this study provide the first genetic evidence for a new coronavirus associated with epizootic catarrhal gastroenteritis outbreaks in mink and demonstrate that MCoVs possess high genomic variability and relatively low overall nucleotide sequence identities (91.7 %) between contemporary strains. Additionally, the new MCoVs appeared to be phylogenetically distant from human (229E and NL63) and other alphacoronaviruses and did not belong to the species Alphacoronavirus 1. It is proposed that, together with the partially sequenced FRECV and FRSCV, they comprise a new species within the genus Alphacoronavirus.

Developing a percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy service by medical intensivists: experience at one academic institution.

PURPOSE Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) is increasingly becoming the preferred method, compared with open surgical tracheostomy, for patients requiring chronic ventilatory assistance. Little is known regarding the process involved to incorporate PDT as a standard service in the medical intensive care unit. In this report, we describe our experience developing a "PDT service" led by medical intensivists. MATERIALS AND METHODS With support from our leadership and surgical colleagues, we developed a credentialing and training process for medical intensivists, formulated a bedside team to perform PDT, refined our technique, and maintained a patient data registry for quality improvement. RESULTS To date, our service includes 4 medical intensivists with PDT privileges. Over a 4-year period, we performed 171 PDTs for patients in the medical intensive care unit after 12.1 ± 8.2 days of mechanical ventilation. Our procedure-related complication rates are similar to other reports. No patient required emergent open surgical tracheostomy, and there were no deaths related to PDT. We required minimal to no backup support from our surgical colleagues in performing PDT. CONCLUSIONS We successfully developed a medical intensivist-driven PDT service, sharing our unique successes and challenges, to facilitate the care of our patients requiring prolonged ventilator support.

From Individual To Social Trauma: Sources Of Everyday Trauma In Italy, The US And UK During The Covid-19 Pandemic.

The heterogeneity of COVID-19 experience and response for each individual is irrefutable; nevertheless, similarities can be observed between countries with respect to people's psychological responses. The main aim of this Commentary is to provide a cultural perspective of the sources of trauma, at the individual and social level, in three different countries: Italy, US and UK. The evidence from previous outbreaks, such as SARS, H1N1 flu, Ebola, and the ongoing Italian, the US, and the UK experience of COVID-19 shows that COVID-19 has introduced not only an individual trauma but also a collective trauma, that researchers should attend to now and in future global emergencies. Future clinical interventions should aim to reconnect dissociated parts both in the individual and in society. This commentary discusses four potential sources of trauma: high-stakes decision fatigue in healthcare professionals, traumatic grief, and bereavement in people who have lost loved ones, loss of roles and identity, and social divisions related to economic shutdown.

Unilateral and bilateral laparoscopic ovariectomy in 157 mares: a retrospective multicenter study.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate surgical techniques, perioperative complications and outcome of laparoscopic surgery for unilateral and bilateral ovariectomy in mares. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective multicenter case series. ANIMALS Mares (n = 157). METHODS Indications for surgery were neutering, fertility problems, elimination of hormone-related abnormal behavior, ovarian tumors as well as nonregressive ovarian hematomas or cysts. Ovariectomy (n = 206) were performed by a standard laparoscopic procedure in 157 standing sedated mares. Dissection and hemostasis were achieved by using either (1) a linear stapling device, (2) bipolar electrosurgical instruments, with or without a modified Roeder knot, (3) a vessel-sealing system, or (4) a diode-laser with ligation. For some larger ovarian masses (>20 cm diameter), a 2-step surgical procedure was used with standing flank laparoscopic ovariectomy followed by ovarian retrieval through a median celiotomy. Surgical techniques, outcome, and perioperative complications of each method were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS Laparoscopic dissection of the ovary was accomplished in all mares. Because of the size of the ovarian tumor (n = 7) or in 1 mare with behavioral problems (n = 1), the dissected ovary was removed through a median celiotomy under general anesthesia. Seventeen mares (10.8%) developed postoperative complications (eg, incisional drainage, incisional infection, seroma formation, dehiscence, transient fever and mild abdominal discomfort). All mares with flank incisional problems had ovarian size >12 cm and in 15 (88%) of these mares electrosurgical instruments were used for mesovarial dissection. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic ovariectomy in standing sedated mares provides good surgical access and is associated with low morbidity.

Oropharyngeal surfactant can improve initial stabilisation and reduce rescue intubation in infants born below 25 weeks of gestation.

AIM Minimally aggressive and easily performed techniques that facilitate spontaneous respiratory stabilisation are required to reduce rescue intubation in extremely premature infants. This study evaluated the feasibility and safety of administering surfactant into the pharynx of infants born at <25 weeks immediately after birth. METHODS This study of 19 infants was conducted from January 2013 to June 2014 in a tertiary perinatal centre in Prague. We administered 1.5 mL of Curosurf as a bolus into the pharynx and simultaneously performed a sustained inflation manoeuvre (SIM). The extent of the interventions, death and severe neonatal morbidity in the study group were compared with 20 controls born before the study period and 20 born after it. RESULTS All infants received oropharyngeal surfactant within the median (interquartile range) time of 40 seconds (25-75) after cord camping. The surfactant had to be suctioned in one infant because of upper airway obstruction. Although more subsequent surfactant was administered in the study group, significantly fewer study period infants required intubation than the before and after controls (16% versus 75% and 58%, respectively, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION Oropharyngeal surfactant with simultaneous SIM was feasible and safe and reduced the need for delivery room intubation in these fragile infants.

Laparoscopic sacral colpopexy and a new approach to mesh fixation: a randomized clinical trial.

PURPOSE Laparoscopic sacral colpopexy (LSC) plus supracervical hysterectomy (LSH) for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a high-complexity surgical procedure. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a new approach to vaginal-mesh fixation during LSC with continuous locked suture. METHODS This is a prospective randomized double-blinded clinical trial enrolling 90 patients with severe POP from January 2016 to April 2017. Patients underwent LSH plus a "two-meshes" LSC and were randomized, regarding mesh fixation, in Group 1 (extracorporeal interrupted 3-0 delayed absorbable sutures) and Group 2 (running locked 3-0 delayed absorbable suture). Our primary endpoints were the operative times and the secondary endpoints the incidence of intra- or post-operative complications. RESULTS A total of 42 patients for group completed the study. Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. Overall mesh fixation time (24 vs. 39 min; p < 0.01), and operative time (121 vs. 138 min; p < 0.05) resulted significantly lower in Group 2. No differences were found in terms of anatomic failure, vaginal mesh erosion or intra- or post-operative complications. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic continuous locked 3-0 absorbable suture for anterior and posterior mesh fixation during LSC guaranteed a faster and effective alternative to multiple interrupted sutures. The significant operative time reduction linked to this technique should be considered even more helpful when performing a highly complex surgery such as LSC.

Efficacy and safety of herbal medicine (Dangguijagyag-san) for primary dysmenorrhea: study protocol for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center trial.

Background Dangguijagyag-san, also known as Dangguishaoyao-san in Chinese and Toki-shakuyakui-san in Japanese, has been frequently used to treat symptoms associated with dysmenorrhea. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the herbal medicine, Dangguijagyag-san, relative to those of active control, Gamisoyo-san, and a placebo control for primary dysmenorrhea. Methods This protocol details a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-center, investigator-initiated, controlled trial evaluating treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. Two hundred and forty participants will be randomly divided into one of three groups: 1) the Dangguijagyag-san experimental group (EG) (n = 105), 2) the Gamisoyo-san active control group (ACG) (n = 30), and 3) the placebo control group (PCG) (n = 105). The interventions will be administered for two menstrual cycles, and the follow-up will be carried out for the following six menstrual cycles. The primary outcomes are difference in response rates between the EG and the ACG (non-inferiority comparison) and difference in changes from baseline in average pain intensity measured by the visual analogue scale between the EG and PCG (superiority comparison). The secondary outcomes are pain scores derived from pain assessment tools (verbal multidimensional scoring system, retrospective symptom scale, and short form McGill pain questionnaire), dosage of analgesics, pattern diagnosis questionnaires, and short form 36 health survey. Adverse events and vital signs will be checked at every visit, and laboratory tests will be performed for safety evaluation. Discussion The results of this clinical trial will offer evidence for the efficacy and safety of Dangguijagyag-san for primary dysmenorrhea. Trial registration Clinical Research Information Service of Korea: KCT0003005.

Uptake of Transanal Total Mesorectal Excision in North America: Initial Assessment of a Structured Training Program and the Experience of Delegate Surgeons.

BACKGROUND Transanal total mesorectal excision is a new approach to curative-intent rectal cancer surgery. Training and surgeon experience with this approach has not been assessed previously in America. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to characterize a structured training program and to determine the experience of delegate surgeons. DESIGN Data were assimilated from an anonymous, online survey delivered to attendees on course completion. Data on surgeon performance during hands-on cadaveric dissection were collected prospectively. SETTINGS This study was conducted at a single tertiary colorectal surgery referral center, and cadaveric hands-on training was conducted at a specialized surgeon education center. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The main outcome measurement was the use of the course and surgeon experience posttraining. RESULTS During a 12-month period, eight 2-day transanal total mesorectal excision courses were conducted. Eighty-one colorectal surgeons successfully completed the course. During cadaveric dissection, 71% achieved a complete (Quirke 3) specimen; 26% were near complete (Quirke 2), and 3% were incomplete (Quirke 1). A total of 9.1% demonstrated dissection in the incorrect plane, whereas 4.5% created major injury to the rectum or surrounding structures, excluding the prostate. Thirty eight (46.9%) of 81 surgeon delegates responded to an online survey. Of survey respondents, 94.6% believed training should be required before performing transanal total mesorectal excision. Posttraining, 94.3% of surgeon delegates planned to use transanal total mesorectal excision for distal-third rectal cancers, 74.3% for middle-third cancers, and 8.6% for proximal-third cancers. The most significant complication reported was urethral injury; 5 were reported by the subset of survey respondents who had performed this operation postcourse. LIMITATIONS The study was limited by inherent reporting bias, including observer and recall biases. CONCLUSIONS Although this structured training program for transanal total mesorectal excision was found to be useful by the majority of respondents, the risk of iatrogenic injury after training remains high, suggesting that this training pedagogy alone is insufficient.

Epidemiology and clinical presentations of human coronavirus NL63 infections in hong kong children.

Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) has been found in children presenting with respiratory tract infections (RTIs). However, the epidemiology and clinical course of this newly identified virus have not been fully elucidated. This study investigated the epidemiology, seasonality, and clinical features of HCoV-NL63 in Hong Kong children. This study consisted of two cohorts of children hospitalized in a university-affiliated teaching hospital. In the 12-month retrospective part of the study, reverse transcription-PCR was used to detect HCoVs in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs). Positive samples were sequenced to confirm the identity of the virus and to determine its phylogenetic relationship with the HCoV-NL63 strains found elsewhere. The second part covered a subsequent 12-month period in which patients were prospectively recruited. Altogether, 1,981 and 1,001 NPA specimens were studied in 2005-2006 and 2006-2007, respectively. Seventy-four (2.5%) HCoV isolates were identified and consisted of 17 (0.6%) HCoV-NL63 isolates, 37 (1.2%) HCoV-OC43 isolates, 14 (0.5%) HCoV-HKU1 isolates, and 6 (0.2%) HCoV-229E isolates. HCoV-NL63 infection was more common in 2006-2007 than 2005-2006 (1.2% and 0.3%, respectively; P = 0.006). From 2005 to 2007, the peak season for HCoV-NL63 infection was in September-October, which was earlier than the peak for HCoV-OC43 infections (December-January). HCoV-NL63-infected patients were younger and more likely to have croup, febrile convulsions, and acute gastroenteritis. The majority of local HCoV-NL63 isolates were phylogenetically closely related to those found in Belgium and The Netherlands. In conclusion, HCoV-NL63 is an important yet uncommon virus among our hospitalized children with acute RTIs.

Dysfunction of respiratory muscles in critically ill patients on the intensive care unit.

Muscular weakness and muscle wasting may often be observed in critically ill patients on intensive care units (ICUs) and may present as failure to wean from mechanical ventilation. Importantly, mounting data demonstrate that mechanical ventilation itself may induce progressive dysfunction of the main respiratory muscle, i.e. the diaphragm. The respective condition was termed 'ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction' (VIDD) and should be distinguished from peripheral muscular weakness as observed in 'ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW)'. Interestingly, VIDD and ICU-AW may often be observed in critically ill patients with, e.g. severe sepsis or septic shock, and recent data demonstrate that the pathophysiology of these conditions may overlap. VIDD may mainly be characterized on a histopathological level as disuse muscular atrophy, and data demonstrate increased proteolysis and decreased protein synthesis as important underlying pathomechanisms. However, atrophy alone does not explain the observed loss of muscular force. When, e.g. isolated muscle strips are examined and force is normalized for cross-sectional fibre area, the loss is disproportionally larger than would be expected by atrophy alone. Nevertheless, although the exact molecular pathways for the induction of proteolytic systems remain incompletely understood, data now suggest that VIDD may also be triggered by mechanisms including decreased diaphragmatic blood flow or increased oxidative stress. Here we provide a concise review on the available literature on respiratory muscle weakness and VIDD in the critically ill. Potential underlying pathomechanisms will be discussed before the background of current diagnostic options. Furthermore, we will elucidate and speculate on potential novel future therapeutic avenues.

The education and training of future hip preservation surgeons: aggregate recommendations of high-volume surgeons.

Hip preservation is one of the fastest growing subspecialties in orthopaedic surgery. Surgical training recommendations and guidelines in this field are lacking. To survey high volume hip preservation surgeons regarding their perspectives on the current and future training of surgeons entering their field, a cross-sectional survey of 16 high-volume hip preservation surgeons was conducted to gather perspectives and opinions on the most appropriate education of future hip preservation surgeons. All participants completed the survey in person and anonymously. Of the surveyed surgeons, the mean career hip preservation volume was 1031.25 cases (250 to >3000) with an average annual volume of 162.08 cases (75-400). The average number of hip arthroscopy cases necessary to competently perform joint access is 19, labral repair is 34, acetabuloplasty/femoroplasty are 54, labral reconstruction is 101 and capsular closure/plication is 53. Fifty-six percent of the surgeons believe mid-career surgeons who have never performed hip preservation surgery should not adopt it as part of their practice. The mean optimal number of cases recommended was 128 hip arthroscopies during a dedicated hip preservation fellowship and 67 hip arthroscopies during a sports medicine fellowship. Surgeons with an interest in hip preservation careers, should strongly consider a 12-month dedicated hip preservation fellowship that provides exposure to at least 128 cases, including open and arthroscopic techniques, hip arthroplasty, and research opportunities. Mid-career surgeons should be cautious about adopting hip preservation into their practice if they have not had prior adequate training.

Interferon-inducible LY6E Protein Promotes HIV-1 Infection.

LY6E is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored, IFN-inducible protein that regulates T lymphocytes proliferation, differentiation, and development. Single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2572886 in the LY6 family protein locus has been shown to associate with accelerated progression to AIDS. In this study, we show that LY6E promotes HIV, type 1 (HIV-1) infection by enhancing viral entry and gene expression. Knockdown of LY6E in human peripheral blood mononuclear, SupT1, and THP-1 cells diminishes HIV-1 replication. Virion-cell and cell-cell fusion experiments revealed that LY6E promotes membrane fusion of the viral entry step. Interestingly, we find that LTR-driven HIV-1 gene expression is also enhanced by LY6E, suggesting additional roles of LY6E in HIV-1 replication. HIV-1 infection induces LY6E expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, concomitant with increased production of type I IFN and some classical IFN-stimulated genes. Altogether, our results demonstrate that IFN-inducible LY6E promotes HIV-1 entry and replication and highlight a positive regulatory role of IFN-induced proteins in HIV-1 infection. Our work emphasizes the complexity of IFN-mediated signaling in HIV-host interaction and AIDS pathogenesis.

Importance The influence on the psychology and ocular surface of ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is not yet fully understood. Objective To characterize mental state and ocular surface state of ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, and similar areas during the COVID-19 outbreak. Design, Setting, and Participants This survey study assessed ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, and Jiangxi, China, a province approximately 300 km south of Wuhan. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Van Dream Anxiety Scale, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index were used to conduct questionnaire surveys via a messaging and social media app. Main Outcomes and Measures Mean scores from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (0-10 points), the Van Dream Anxiety Scale (0-100 points), and the Ocular Surface Disease Index (0-100 points). Results Of 126 individuals, there were 42 ophthalmologists (33.3%) and 21 ophthalmic nurses (16.7%) from Wuhan and 42 ophthalmologists (33.3%) and 21 nurses (16.7%) from Jiangxi. The mean (SD) age of ophthalmologists was 36.1 (7.6) years in Wuhan and 41.2 (8.8) years in Jiangxi. For ophthalmic nurses, the mean (SD) age was 35.2 (7.4) years in Wuhan and 33.4 (7.9) years in Jiangxi. The response rate for ophthalmologists was 90.3% (84 of 93) and for nurses was 91.3% (42 of 46). The participation rate of ophthalmologists and nurses in Wuhan was 0.06% (42 of 70 000) and 0.07% (21 of 30 000), respectively; the participation rate in Jiangxi was 0.06% (42 of 70 000; 21 of 35 000) for both groups. In Wuhan, the mean (SD) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (anxiety and depression were counted as separate scores), Van Dream Anxiety Scale, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index scores were 6.90 (2.30), 7.38 (2.19), 24.52 (5.86), and 43.90 (3.74), respectively, in ophthalmologists and 8.67 (3.04), 9.38 (2.64), 21.48 (6.15), and 40.05 (6.67), respectively, in ophthalmic nurses. In Jiangxi, these scores were 5.67 (2.89), 4.90 (3.15), 12.76 (7.27), and 38.79 (7.78), respectively, in ophthalmologists and 4.67 (3.20), 4.33 (3.23), 10.10 (7.62), and 41.52 (5.92), respectively, in ophthalmic nurses. The difference (95% CI) between the 2 regions for these scores in ophthalmologists was 2.48 (95% CI, 1.30-3.65), 11.76 (95% CI, 8.90-14.63), 5.12 (95% CI, 2.45-7.79), and 5.12 (95% CI, 2.47-7.77), respectively, and in ophthalmic nurses was 4.16 (95% CI, 2.05-5.95), 5.05 (95% CI, 3.21-6.89), 11.38 (95% CI, 7.06-15.70), and -1.48 (95% CI, -5.41 to 2.25), respectively. Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan experienced more anxiety and depression and reported greater ocular surface abnormalities than counterparts outside of Wuhan, but the wide CIs preclude concluding confidently that there were differences.

Novel polyomaviral infection in the placenta of a northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) on the Pribilof Islands, Alaska, USA.

Viruses of the family Polyomaviridae infect a wide variety of avian and mammalian hosts with a broad spectrum of outcomes including asymptomatic infection, acute systemic disease, and tumor induction. In 2010, intranuclear viral inclusion bodies were identified in trophoblasts of a single northern fur seal (NFS; Callorhinus ursinus) placenta from a presumed healthy birth on St. Paul Island, Alaska. On transmission electron microscopy, virions were approximately 40 nm in diameter and were arranged in paracrystalline arrays within the nucleus. The tissue was positive for the polyomaviral major capsid gene (VP1) by PCR, and the sequenced product revealed a novel Orthopolyomavirus. Twenty-nine additional NFS placentas, devoid of viral inclusions on histologic examination, were tested for polyomavirus by PCR; all were negative. The significance of this novel virus for the infected animal is unknown, but the virus does not appear to be very prevalent within the placentas from newborn northern fur seal pups.

ANTEMORTEM DIAGNOSIS AND SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT OF A COMPLETE MOLAR PREGNANCY IN A GERIATRIC BONOBO ( PAN PANISCUS).

A 47-yr-old multiparous female bonobo ( Pan paniscus) tested positive for pregnancy on a routine urine test. Because this geriatric animal was considered postreproductive, oral contraception had been discontinued. Sequential transabdominal ultrasound evaluations were performed under voluntary behavior and revealed that the uterus contained a mass of heterogenous tissue which was rapidly increasing in size. Due to a lack of normal fetal development and the ultrasonographic appearance of the uterine tissue, a molar pregnancy was suspected. Ovariohysterectomy was performed, and a complete hydatidiform mole was confirmed through human chorionic gonadotropin levels as well as gross and histological examination of the uterus. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time a complete molar pregnancy has been reported antemortem in a nonhuman great ape, although a single case of partial hydatidiform mole was previously documented in a chimpanzee on postmortem examination. This case describes the successful medical and surgical management of complete molar pregnancy in a bonobo and provides support for extending the age range of birth control recommendations in geriatric captive great apes that exhibit active breeding behavior.

Laparoscopic versus open parenchymal preserving liver resections in the posterosuperior segments: a case-matched study.

BACKGROUND Patients with lesions in the posterosuperior (PS) segments of the liver have been considered poor candidates for laparoscopic liver resection (LLR). This study aims to compare short-term outcomes of LLR and open liver resections (OLR) in the PS segments. METHODS This multicenter study consisted of all patients who underwent LLR in the PS segments and all patients who underwent OLR in the PS segments between October 2011 and July 2016. Laparoscopic cases were case-matched with those who had an identical open procedure during the same period based on tumor location (same segment) and the Brisbane classification of the resection. Demographics, comorbid factors, perioperative outcomes, short-term outcomes, necessity of adjuvant chemotherapy, and the interval between surgery and initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy were compared between the two groups. Data were retrieved from a prospectively maintained electronic database. RESULTS Both groups were comparable for age, sex, ASA score, maximum tumor diameter, and number of patients with additional liver resections outside the posterior segments. Operative time was similar in both groups (median 140 min; p = 0.92). Blood loss was less in the LLR-group (median: 150 vs. 300 ml in OLR-group). Median hospital stay was 6 days in both groups. There was no significant difference in postoperative complications (OLR-group: 31.4% vs. LLR-group: 25.7%; p = 0.60). There was no significant difference in R0 resections (LLR: 97.2 vs. 100% in OLR; p = 1.00). Tumor-free margins were less in the LLR group (LLR: 5 vs. 9.5 mm in OLR; p = 0.012). Patients undergoing LLR were treated with chemotherapy sooner compared to those undergoing OLR (41 vs. 56 days, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION This study suggests that laparoscopic parenchymal preserving liver resections in the PS segments can be performed with comparable short-term outcomes as similar OLR. The shorter interval to chemotherapy might provide long-term oncologic benefits in patients who underwent LLR.

Resilience is spreading: Mental health within the COVID-19 pandemic.

The COVID-19 global pandemic is in many ways unchartered mental health territory, but history would suggest that long-term resilience will be the most common outcome, even for those most directly impacted by the outbreak. We address 4 common myths about resilience and discuss ways to systematically build individual and community resiliency. Actively cultivating social support, adaptive meaning, and direct prosocial behaviors to reach the most vulnerable can have powerful resilience promoting effects.

Pathology of experimental SARS coronavirus infection in cats and ferrets.

The pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in cats and ferrets is poorly described, and the distribution of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor for SARS-CoV, in the respiratory tracts of these species is unknown. We observed SARS-CoV antigen expression and lesions in the respiratory tracts of 4 cats and 4 ferrets at 4 days postinoculation and ACE2 expression in the respiratory tracts of 3 cats and 3 ferrets without infection. All infected cats and ferrets had diffuse alveolar damage associated with SARS-CoV antigen expression. A novel SARS-CoV-associated lesion was tracheo-bronchoadenitis in cats. SARS-CoV antigen expression occurred mainly in type I and II pneumocytes and serous cells of tracheo-bronchial submucosal glands of cats and in type II pneumocytes of ferrets. ACE2 expression occurred mainly in type I and II pneumocytes, tracheo-bronchial goblet cells, serous epithelial cells of tracheo-bronchial submucosal glands in cats, and type II pneumocytes and serous epithelial cells of tracheo-bronchial submucosal glands in ferrets. In conclusion, the pathology of SARS-CoV infection in cats and ferrets resembles that in humans except that syncytia and hyaline membranes were not observed. The identification of tracheo-bronchoadenitis in cats has potential implications for SARS pathogenesis and SARS-CoV excretion. Finally, these results show the importance of ACE2 expression for SARS-CoV infection in vivo: whereas ACE2 expression in type I and II pneumocytes in cats corresponded to SARS-CoV antigen expression in both cell types, expression of both ACE2 and SARS-CoV antigen in ferrets was limited mainly to type II pneumocytes.

Laparoscopic varicocelectomy: virtual reality training and learning curve.

OBJECTIVES To explore the role that virtual reality training might play in the learning curve of laparoscopic varicocelectomy. METHODS A total of 1326 laparoscopic varicocelectomy cases performed by 16 participants from July 2005 to June 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. The participants were divided into 2 groups: group A was trained by laparoscopic trainer boxes; group B was trained by a virtual reality training course preoperatively. The operation time curves were drafted, and the learning, improving, and platform stages were divided and statistically confirmed. The operation time and number of cases in the learning and improving stages of both groups were compared. Testicular artery sparing failure and postoperative hydroceles rate were statistically analyzed for the confirmation of the learning curve. RESULTS The learning curve of laparoscopic varicocelectomy was 15 cases, and with 14 cases more, it came into the platform stage. The number of cases for the learning stages of both groups showed no statistical difference (P=.49), but the operation time of group B for the learning stage was less than that of group A (P<.00001). The number of cases of group B for the improving stage was significantly less than that of group A (P=.005), but the operation time of both groups in the improving stage showed no difference (P=.30). The difference of testicular artery sparing failure rates among these 3 stages was proved significant (P<.0001), the postoperative hydroceles rate showed no statistical difference (P=.60). CONCLUSIONS The virtual reality training shortened the operation time in the learning stage and hastened the trainees' steps in the improving stage, but did not shorten the learning curve as expected to.

Endovascular management of distal ACA aneurysms: single-institution clinical experience in 22 consecutive patients and literature review.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Distal ACA aneurysms remain difficult to treat with endovascular therapy, but improved technology and experience allows for the treatment of some of these aneurysms with excellent results. The purpose of this study was to assess the status of endovascular treatment of distal ACA aneurysms by comparing our results with recent endovascular and microsurgical series of distal ACA aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 2000 and 2008, a total of 22 consecutive patients (14 women; mean age, 58.4 years) with distal ACA aneurysms underwent coil placement at Barrow Neurological Institute. Clinical presentations, radiographic findings, endovascular management, and outcomes were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS Of the 22 patients, 13 (59%) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Six patients were HH grade I or II, 1 was grade III, 5 were grade IV, and 1 was grade V. Frontal lobe hematomas occurred in 5 patients with ruptured aneurysms. The mean aneurysm size was 7.5 mm (range, 2.8-25 mm); 55% were smaller than 7 mm. Twelve aneurysms (55%) arose from the origin of the callosomarginal artery (55%). Complete occlusion was achieved in 50% of the cases and near-complete occlusion in 45%. The few periprocedural complications included 1 retroperitoneal hematoma and 1 intraoperative rupture. Four patients had thromboembolic events adequately treated intraprocedurally with abciximab. No deaths occurred in the patients treated. CONCLUSIONS The characteristics of the patients and aneurysms treated in our series were comparable to previous reports of endovascular treatment of ACA aneurysms with respect to rupture status. Periprocedural morbidity and mortality rates in our series fared well compared with previous reports, as did our combined rate of complete or near-complete occlusions. Recent advances in endovascular devices and techniques have improved outcomes of distal ACA aneurysms.

Hepatitis B virus promotes autophagic degradation but not replication in autophagosome.

In this study, we investigate the relationship of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and autophagy. HepG2 cells and HepG2 cells infected with HBV (HepG2.2.15) were transfected with GFP-LC3 (green fluorescence protein conjugated with microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) expression vector and autophagy status was then examined with confocal microscope. HepG2.2.15 cells were further treated with serum-free medium or 3-methyladenine (3-MA), and subjected to Hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis B polymerase protein detection by immunohistochemistry. Localization of the GFP-LC3 and the HBV proteins was observed by confocal fluorescence microscope. The level of SQSTM1/p62 protein was also evaluated by Western blot analysis. In contrast to a diffuse distribution in HepG2 cells, GFP-LC3 formed distinct punctate dots, which were further enhanced by nutritional starvation, in HepG2.2.15 cells. The expression of hepatitis B polymerase and HBcAg, but not HBsAg, was positively correlated with the autophagic intensity. However, no co-localizations were observed between HBV proteins and autophagosomes. Suppression of autophagy reduced the expression of hepatitis B polymerase and HBcAg, but not HBsAg. Western blot showed that SQSTM1/p62 protein level was declined in HepG2.2.15 cells comparing HepG2 cells, and further reduced while upon serum starvation. In conclusion, HBV infection induces autophagic degradation and autophagy. Autophagy is critical for HBV replication. However HBV replication does not take place in autophagosomes.

Quality of life after great saphenous vein ablation in Thai patients with great saphenous vein reflux.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE To determine the quality of life (QoL) in Thais after intervention for great saphenous vein (GSV) reflux. METHODS Patients with Clinical Etiologic Anatomic Pathophysiologic classes 2 and 3 were enrolled in this study. QoL was measured using the EuroQol descriptive system (EQ-5D) questionnaire, and patients chose to receive either endovenous treatment or surgery after consulting with their surgeons. The QoL before the intervention, at 1 week, and at 1 month after the intervention were evaluated. Patients who reported "no problem" in each domain of the EQ-5D questionnaire before and 1 month after the intervention were compared. Utility gain was estimated from the questionnaire and compared between clinical classes. The proportion of worsening QoL at 1 week after the intervention was compared between patients receiving endovenous procedures and surgery. RESULTS A total of 83 patients-56 received endovenous procedures [23 received ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) and 33 received radiofrequency ablation (RFA)] and 27 received surgery-were enrolled. QoLs were significantly better in all domains after the intervention: pain/discomfort (58%), mobility (42%), anxiety/depression (38%), usual activities (19%), and self-care (9%). Utility gain was 0.255 (95% confidence interval: 0.197-0.313) and higher in class 3. At 1 week after the intervention, surgery had significantly higher patients with worse mobility scores. Among endovenous procedures, UGFS had higher patients with worse pain/discomfort scores than RFA at 1 week after the intervention (16% vs. 0%, p = 0.025). CONCLUSION GSV ablation for GSV reflux in Thai patients with CEAP C2 and C3 categories significantly improves both physical and mental QoL; patients who received endovenous procedures were found to have better early physical QoL.

Short-term outcomes of minimally invasive Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.

BACKGROUND Esophagectomy represents the gold standard in the treatment of resectable esophageal carcinoma. This retrospective study evaluated the significance of minimally invasive Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy (MIILE) for the treatment of esophageal carcinoma. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated 269 patients with esophageal carcinoma who received Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy in our center between October 2011 and January 2013. Of those 269 patients, 106 underwent MIILE and 163 underwent open Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy (OILE). The clinicopathologic factors, operational factors, and postoperative complications were compared. RESULTS The two groups were similar in terms of age, sex, smoking history, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, tumor location, preoperative staging, and incidence of comorbidities. The MIILE approach was associated with a significant decrease in surgical blood loss (p=0.04), chest tube duration (p=0.02), and postoperative stay (p=0.02) relative to the OILE approach. The postoperative in-hospital mortality and total morbidity did not differ between the two groups. The MIILE approach was associated with significantly fewer wound infections than the OILE approach (p=0.04). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the number of total lymph nodes dissected (p=0.69) or the locations of the total lymph nodes dissected (p=0.42). CONCLUSIONS Our MIILE technique can be safely and effectively performed for intrathoracic anastomosis during esophageal operations with favorable early outcomes.

Transanal endoscopic microsurgery.

The aim of oncologic surgery is radical cancer treatment with preservation of function and quality of life. Almost 30 years ago, transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) revolutionised the technique and outcomes of transanal surgery, first becoming the standard of treatment for large rectal adenomas, then offering a possibly curative treatment for early rectal cancer, and finally generating discussion on its potential role in combination with neoadjuvant therapies for the treatment of more invasive cancer. TEM afforded the advantage of combining a less invasive transanal approach with low recurrence rates thanks to enhanced visualization of the surgical field, which allows more precise dissection. We describe the current indications, the preoperative work-up, the surgical technique (with the aid of a video), postoperative management and results obtained in an over 20-year-long experience. Designed as an accurate means to allow excision of benign rectal neoplasms with a very low morbidity rate, TEM today is indicated as a curative treatment of malignant neoplasms that are histologically confirmed as pT1 sm1 carcinomas. T1 sm2-3 and T2 lesions should at present be included in prospective trials. Accurate preoperative staging is essential for optimal selection of patients. Patients with clear indication for TEM should be referred to specialized medical centres experienced with the technique.

COVID19 Prevention & Care; A Cancer Specific Guideline.

On March 11th 2020, the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic by the WHO. One of the groups that is considered high risk in this pandemic are cancer patients as they are treated with a variety of immune system suppressor treatment modalities and this puts them in a great risk for infectious disease (including COVID-19). Therefore, cancer patients require higher level measures for preventing and treating infectious diseases. furthermore, cancer patients may bear additional risk due to the restriction of access to the routine diagnostic and therapeutic services during such epidemic. Since most of the attention of health systems is towards patients affected with COVID-19, the need for structured and unified approaches to COVID-19 prevention and care specific to cancer patients and cancer centers is felt more than ever. This article provides the recommendations and possible actions that should be considered by patients, their caregivers and families, physician, nurses, managers and staff of medical centers involved in cancer diagnosis and treatment. We pursued two major goals in our recommendations: first, limiting the exposure of cancer patients to medical environments and second, modifying the treatment modalities in a manner that reduces the probability of myelosuppression such as delaying elective diagnostic and therapeutic services, shortening the treatment course, or prolonging the interval between treatment courses.

Considerations for Managing Patients With Hematologic Malignancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Seattle Strategy.

In January 2020, the first documented patient in the United States infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was diagnosed in Washington State. Since that time, community spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the state has changed the practice of oncologic care at our comprehensive cancer center in Seattle. At the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, the primary oncology clinic for the University of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Consortium, our specialists who manage adult patients with hematologic malignancies have rapidly adjusted clinical practices to mitigate the potential risks of COVID-19 to our patients. We suggest that our general management decisions and modifications in Seattle are broadly applicable to patients with hematologic malignancies. Despite a rapidly changing environment that necessitates opinion-based care, we provide recommendations that are based on best available data from clinical trials and collective knowledge of disease states.

Considerations around the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein with particular attention to COVID-19 brain infection and neurological symptoms.

Spike protein (S protein) is the virus 'key' to infect cells being able to strongly bind to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2), as it has been reported. In fact, Spike structure and function is known to be highly important for cell infection as well as entering the brain. Growing evidence indicates that different types of coronaviruses not only affect the respiratory system, but they might also invade the central nervous system (CNS). However, very few evidence have been so far reported on the presence of COVID-19 in the brain and the potential exploitation, by this virus, of lung to brain axis to reach neurons has not completely understood. In this article we assessed the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequence, structure and electrostatic potential using computational approaches. Our results showed that the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are highly similar, sharing a sequence identity of 77%. In addition, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is slightly more positively charged than that of SARS-CoV since it contains four more positively charged residues and five less negatively charged residues which may lead to an increased affinity to bind to negatively charged regions of other molecules through non-specific and specific interactions. Analyzing of the S protein binds to the host ACE2 receptor showed a 30% higher binding energy for SARS-CoV-2 than the SARS-CoV S protein. These results might be useful for understanding the mechanism of cell entry, blood brain barrier crossing and clinical features related to the CNS infection by SARS-CoV-2.

Nephrectomy via ventral median celiotomy in equids.

OBJECTIVE To report technique for, and outcome after, nephrectomy through a ventral median celiotomy in equids. STUDY DESIGN Case series. ANIMALS Equids with unilateral renal disease (n = 6), aged 2 months to 18 years, weighing 90-434 kg. METHODS A ventral median celiotomy was used to access the left or right kidney. To facilitate surgical exposure, the small intestine was reflected towards the diaphragm using laparotomy sponges and the ascending colon was exteriorized and in some cases evacuated. The peritoneum over the affected kidney was incised and blunt dissection used to free the kidney from the retroperitoneal fat, then the renal artery, vein, and ureter were isolated and ligated. Abdominal lavage with sterile saline solution was performed before abdominal closure. RESULTS Four horses, 1 donkey, and 1 mule had unilateral nephrectomy to treat verminous nephritis (1), idiopathic hematuria (1), and ectopic ureter (4). A ventral median approach provided adequate access to the kidney in all 6 cases. Two horses had postoperative complications (peritonitis, chylous abdominal effusion) that resolved with medical therapy. No complications attributable to nephrectomy were reported by the owners upon follow-up 1-8 years after surgery. CONCLUSIONS A ventral median approach for nephrectomy can be used for unilateral nephrectomy in equids weighing up to 434 kg.

Management of early-stage esophageal neoplasia (MESEN) consensus.

BACKGROUND Treatment of esophageal adenocarcinoma often involves surgical resection. Newer technologies in interventional endoscopy have led to a substantial paradigm shift in the management of early-stage neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus comprising high-grade dysplasia (HGD), intramucosal carcinoma, and, in some cases, submucosal carcinoma. However, there has been no consensus regarding the indications for esophageal preservation in these cases. In this work, consensus guidelines were established for the management of early-stage esophageal neoplasia considering clinically relevant aspects (age, comorbidities, and social environment) in each scenario. METHODS Seventeen experts were invited to participate based on their background and clinical expertise at high-volume centers. A questionnaire was created that included four clinical scenarios covering a wide range of situations within HGD and/or early esophageal neoplasia, particularly where controversies are likely to exist. Each of the clinical scenarios was open to discussion subdivided by patient age (20, 50, and 80 s). For each clinical scenario an expert was chosen to defend that position. Each defense triggered a subsequent discussion during a consensus meeting. Conclusions of that discussion together with an accompanying literature analysis allowed experts to confirm or change their original choices and served as the basis for the recommendations stated in this article. RESULTS There was 100 % consensus supporting esophageal preservation in patients with HGD, independent of patient age or Barrett's length. In patients with T1a adenocarcinoma, consensus for preservation was not reached (65 %) for young and middle-aged individuals but was supported for elderly patients (100 %). For T1b adenocarcinoma, consensus was reached for surgical resection (90 %), leaving organ preservation for patients with very low risk of nodal invasion or poor surgical candidates. CONCLUSION Advances in endoscopic imaging and therapy allow for organ preservation in most settings of early-stage neoplasia of the esophagus, provided that the patient understands the implications of this decision.

Tumor imaging in patients with advanced tumors using a new (99m) Tc-radiolabeled vitamin B12 derivative.

UNLABELLED Targeting cancer cells with vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is hampered by unwanted physiologic tissue uptake mediated by transcobalamin. Adhering to good manufacturing practice, we have developed a new (99m)Tc-cobalamin derivative ((99m)Tc(CO)3-[(4-amido-butyl)-pyridin-2-yl-methyl-amino-acetato] cobalamin, (99m)Tc-PAMA-cobalamin). The derivative shows no binding to transcobalamin but is recognized by haptocorrin, a protein present in the circulation and notably expressed in many tumor cells. In this prospective study, we investigated cancer-specific uptake of (99m)Tc-PAMA-cobalamin in 10 patients with various metastatic tumors. METHODS Ten patients with biopsy-proven metastatic cancer were included. Dynamic imaging was started immediately after injection of 300-500 MBq of (99m)Tc-PAMA-cobalamin, and whole-body scintigrams were obtained at 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min and after 24 h. The relative tumor activity using SPECT/CT over the tumor region after 4 h was measured in comparison to disease-free lung parenchyma. Patients 3-10 received between 20 and 1,000 μg of cobalamin intravenously before injection of (99m)Tc-PAMA-cobalamin. The study population comprised 4 patients with adenocarcinomas of the lung, 3 with squamous cell carcinomas of the hypopharyngeal region, 1 with prostate adenocarcinoma, 1 with breast, and 1 with colon adenocarcinoma. RESULTS The median age of the study group was 61 ± 11 y. Six of 10 patients showed positive tumor uptake on (99m)Tc-PAMA-cobalamin whole-body scintigraphy. The scan was positive in 1 patient with colon adenocarcinoma, in 3 of 4 lung adenocarcinomas, in 1 of 3 hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, and in 1 breast adenocarcinoma. Renal uptake was between 1% and 3% for the left kidney. Predosing with cobalamin increased the tumor uptake and improved blood-pool clearance. The best image quality was achieved with a predose of 20-100 ug of cold cobalamin. The mean patient dose was 2.7 ± 0.9 mSv/patient. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, we report for the first time on (99m)Tc-PAMA-cobalamin imaging in patients with metastatic cancer disease and show that tumor targeting is feasible.

Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy using a modified dome-down approach with conventional laparoscopic instruments.

INTRODUCTION Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) may increase the risk of bile duct injury due to compromised operative exposure. Dome-down laparoscopic cholecystectomy provides the ability to evaluate the cystic duct circumferentially prior to its division, thus minimizing the risks of bile duct injury. This study assesses the feasibility and safety of SILC using a modified dome-down approach with all conventional laparoscopic instruments. METHODS Three low-profile 5-mm trocars are placed via a single transumbilical incision. The two working trocars are aimed laterally via the rectus to achieve adequate triangulation. An extralong 5-mm 30º laparoscope with an L-shaped light-cord adaptor is used to yield more external working space. Cephalic liver retraction is achieved with one transabdominal suture through the gallbladder fundus. Leaving the gallbladder fundus attached to the liver bed, a window is first created between the gallbladder body and the liver. The dissection is then carried down retrograde toward the porta hepatis. A 360º view of the gallbladder-cystic duct junction is achieved prior to transecting the cystic duct. The gallbladder is then freed by separation of the fundal attachments. The specimen is retrieved by enlarging the fascial incision. All fascial defects are then primarily closed. RESULTS Sixteen patients (mean age 31 years, mean BMI 26.3 kg/m(2)) were enrolled in this study. Thirteen had elective surgery for symptomatic cholelithiasis, and three had emergency surgery for acute cholecystitis. Mean operating time was 80.3 min, and blood loss was minimal. All patients were discharged within 24 h without complications. Follow-up at 1 month revealed a barely visible scar within the umbilicus. CONCLUSIONS SILC using a modified dome-down approach is technically feasible with all straight instruments, and it is safe because of good delineation of ductal anatomy. Adoption of this approach may minimize the risk of bile duct injury during early experience of SILC.

Characterizing the phylogenetic specialism-generalism spectrum of mammal parasites.

The distribution of parasites across mammalian hosts is complex and represents a differential ability or opportunity to infect different host species. Here, we take a macroecological approach to investigate factors influencing why some parasites show a tendency to infect species widely distributed in the host phylogeny (phylogenetic generalism) while others infect only closely related hosts. Using a database on over 1400 parasite species that have been documented to infect up to 69 terrestrial mammal host species, we characterize the phylogenetic generalism of parasites using standard effect sizes for three metrics: mean pairwise phylogenetic distance (PD), maximum PD and phylogenetic aggregation. We identify a trend towards phylogenetic specialism, though statistically host relatedness is most often equivalent to that expected from a random sample of host species. Bacteria and arthropod parasites are typically the most generalist, viruses and helminths exhibit intermediate generalism, and protozoa are on average the most specialist. While viruses and helminths have similar mean pairwise PD on average, the viruses exhibit higher variation as a group. Close-contact transmission is the transmission mode most associated with specialism. Most parasites exhibiting phylogenetic aggregation (associating with discrete groups of species dispersed across the host phylogeny) are helminths and viruses.

Laparoscopic Single-Site Myomectomy of 11-cm Intramural Myoma.

STUDY OBJECTIVE To demonstrate the feasibility of laparoscopic single-incision myomectomy using new technology. DESIGN A step-by-step video demonstrating our technique for accomplishing a laparoscopic single-site myomectomy of a large intramural myoma. SETTING Single institution. INTERVENTIONS Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has been shown to have similar outcomes to multiport laparoscopy but with superior cosmetic results [1,2] but has traditionally been associated with an increased learning curve, primarily because of poor ergonomics and instrument collisions, lack of triangulation, and, until recently, inadequate instrumentation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We present a case of laparoscopic single-site myomectomy of an 11-cm intramural myoma. This video was exempt from institutional review board review at our institution. SILS has traditionally been associated with poor ergonomics; however, we found that the articulating Enseal G2 Articulating Tissue Sealer (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Blue Ash, OH) enables completion of complex surgical procedures not traditionally associated with single-site laparoscopy. This video demonstrates our technique to successfully accomplish a single-site laparoscopic myomectomy including the importance of vertical closure with V-Loc (Covidien, New Haven, CT) at the surgical site. CONCLUSION We found that the articulating Enseal enables a single-incision laparoscopic myomectomy to be performed with only minimal modifications on multiport surgery techniques. We were able to successfully perform a myomectomy on an 11-cm intramural myoma with excellent cosmetic results.

Consensus statement on definitions and nomenclature for robotic thoracic surgery.

OBJECTIVES Robotic thoracic operations are increasing, and new robotic systems are imminent. A definition of what constitutes a robotic thoracic operation and a nomenclature to detail the technique used is needed to accurately compare outcomes. METHODS The American Association of Thoracic Surgeons Guideline Committee appointed an expert consensus writing committee to construct definitions and nomenclature for robotic thoracic surgery. A PubMed search was generated and after vetting and review of the literature a consensus statement was reached. RESULTS The proposed definition is: "A robotic thoracic operation is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that does not spread, lift or remove any part of the chest or abdominal wall and is characterized by: the surgeon and the assistant's vision of the operative field is via a monitor only and the patient's tissue is manipulated by robotic instruments that follow a slave like mimic of human hands or thoughts via a computerized system." In addition, a flexible nomenclature is proposed that should be applicable to current and future robotic systems that details the number of robotic arms used, the types of ports and/or incisions made, the use of insufflation, and the operation performed. CONCLUSIONS The American Association of Thoracic Surgeons writing committee proposes a definition and nomenclature for robotic thoracic surgery. Definitions are needed to ensure that future studies accurately compare results and outcomes and nomenclatures allow surgeons and scientists from diverse countries and cultures to use the same language to allow accurate communication.

COVID-19: Generate and apply local modelled Transmission and Morbidity effects to provide an estimate of the variation in overall Relative Healthcare Resource Impact at General Practice Granularity.

INTRODUCTION Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the name given to the 2019 novel coronavirus. COVID-19 is the name given to the disease associated with the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus not been previously identified in humans. METHODS Two key factors, case incidence and case morbidity were analysed for England. When taken together they give an estimate of relative demand on healthcare utilisation. To analyse case incidence, the latest values for indicators that could be associated with infection transmission rates were collected from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) sources. These included population density, %age>16, at fulltime work/education, %age over 60, %BME ethnicity, social deprivation as IMD2019, location as latitude/longitude, and patient engagement as %self-confident in their own long-term condition management. Average case morbidity was calculated. To provide a comparative measure of overall healthcare resource impact, individual GP practice impact scores were compared against the median practice. RESULTS The case incidence regression is a dynamic situation but it currently shows that Urban, %Working and age>60 were the strongest determinants of case incidence. The local population comorbidity remains unchanged. The range of relative healthcare impact was wide with 80% of practices falling at 20%-250% of the national median. Once practice population numbers were included we found that the top 33% of GP practices supporting 45% of the patient population would require 68% of COVID-19 healthcare resources. The model provides useful information about the relative impact of Covid-19 on healthcare workload at GP practice granularity in all parts of England. CONCLUSION Covid-19 is impacting on the utilisation of health/social care resources across the world. This model provides a way of predicting relative local levels of disease burden based on defined criteria, thereby providing a method for targeting limited care resources to optimise national/regional/local responses to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Insufficient Humidification of Respiratory Gases in Patients Who Are Undergoing Therapeutic Hypothermia at a Paediatric and Adult Intensive Care Unit.

For cooled newborn infants, humidifier settings for normothermic condition provide excessive gas humidity because absolute humidity at saturation is temperature-dependent. To assess humidification of respiratory gases in patients who underwent moderate therapeutic hypothermia at a paediatric/adult intensive care unit, 6 patients were studied over 9 times. Three humidifier settings, 37-default (chamber-outlet, 37°C; Y-piece, 40°C), 33.5-theoretical (chamber-outlet, 33.5°C; Y-piece, 36.5°C), and 33.5-adjusted (optimised setting to achieve saturated vapour at 33.5°C using feedback from a thermohygrometer), were tested. Y-piece gas temperature/humidity and the incidence of high (>40.6 mg/L) and low (<32.9 mg/L) humidity relative to the target level (36.6 mg/L) were assessed. Y-piece gas humidity was 32.0 (26.8-37.3), 22.7 (16.9-28.6), and 36.9 (35.5-38.3) mg/L {mean (95% confidence interval)} for 37-default setting, 33.5-theoretical setting, and 33.5-adjusted setting, respectively. High humidity was observed in 1 patient with 37-default setting, whereas low humidity was seen in 5 patients with 37-default setting and 8 patients with 33.5-theoretical setting. With 33.5-adjusted setting, inadequate Y-piece humidity was not observed. Potential risks of the default humidifier setting for insufficient respiratory gas humidification were highlighted in patients cooled at a paediatric/adult intensive care unit. Y-piece gas conditions can be controlled to the theoretically optimal level by adjusting the setting guided by Y-piece gas temperature/humidity.

Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with 177Lu-DOTATATE for patients with somatostatin receptor-expressing neuroendocrine tumors: the first US phase 2 experience.

OBJECTIVE Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs is a novel method of treatment in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). For the first time in the United States, we present preliminary results of the treatment with Lutetium (177)(Lu) DOTATATE in patients with progressive NETs. METHODS Thirty-seven patients with grade 1 and grade 2 disseminated and progressive gastroenteropancreatic NET were enrolled in a nonrandomized, phase 2 clinical trial. Repeated cycles of 200 mCi (7.4 GBq; ±10%) were administered up to the cumulative dose of 800 mCi (29.6 GBq; ±10%). RESULTS Among 32 evaluable patients, partial response and minimal response to treatment were seen in 28% and 3%, respectively, and stable disease was seen in 41% of patients. A total of 28% had progressive disease. A response to treatment was significantly associated with lower burden of disease in the liver. No significant acute or delayed hematologic or kidney toxicity was observed. An impressive improvement of performance status and quality of life were seen after Lu-DOTATATE therapy. CONCLUSIONS Treatment with multiple cycles of (177)Lu-DOTATATE peptide receptor radionuclide therapy is well tolerated. This treatment results in control of the disease in most patients, whereas systemic toxicities are limited and reversible. Quality of life is also improved.

Potential COVID-19 therapeutics from a rare disease: Weaponizing lipid dysregulation to combat viral infectivity.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in the death of more than 328,000 persons worldwide in the first 5 months of 2020. Herculean efforts to rapidly design and produce vaccines and other antiviral interventions are ongoing. However, newly evolving viral mutations, the prospect of only temporary immunity, and a long path to regulatory approval pose significant challenges and call for a common, readily available and inexpensive treatment. Strategic drug repurposing combined with rapid testing of established molecular targets could provide a pause in disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 shares extensive structural and functional conservation with SARS-CoV-1 including engagement of the same host cell receptor (ACE2) localized in cholesterol-rich microdomains. These lipid-enveloped viruses encounter the endosomal/lysosomal host compartment in a critical step of infection and maturation. Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C) disease is a rare, monogenic neurodegenerative disease caused by deficient efflux of lipids from the late endosome/lysosome (LE/L). The NP-C disease-causing gene (NPC1) has been strongly associated with viral infection, as a filovirus receptor (e.g., Ebola) and through LE/L lipid trafficking. This suggests NPC1 inhibitors or NP-C disease mimetics could serve as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Fortunately, there are such clinically approved molecules that elicit antiviral activity in pre-clinical studies, without causing NP-C disease. Inhibition of NPC1 may impair viral SARS-CoV-2 infectivity via several lipid-dependent mechanisms, which disturb the microenvironment optimum for viral infectivity. We suggest that known mechanistic information on NPC1 could be utilized to identify existing and future drugs to treat COVID-19.

Innominate artery cannulation for arterial perfusion during aortic arch surgery.

OBJECTIVE Antegrade cerebral perfusion during aortic arch surgery plays an important role in improving postoperative neurological outcomes. We report our experience using innominate artery cannulation for arterial perfusion during aortic arch surgery. METHODS From January 2008 to December 2015, 159 patients underwent aortic arch surgery using innominate artery perfusion and were included in the study analysis (mean age, 71.4 ± 9.1 years; male, 120). RESULTS Total arch replacement was performed in 84.1% of all patients. The incidence of postoperative stroke was 2.5%, with an overall in-hospital mortality rate of 2.5%. CONCLUSIONS Innominate artery perfusionis a safe and useful technique for aortic arch surgery.

Severe COVID-19 infection and thrombotic microangiopathy: success doesn't come easily.

Recent evidence suggests that signs and symptoms of severe COVID-19 infection resemble more the pathophysiology and phenotype of complement-mediated thrombotic micoangiopathies (TMA), rather than sepsis-induced coagulopathy or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (Campbell and Kahwash 2020, Zhang, et al 2020). Since effective treatment is available for complement-mediated TMA (Gavriilaki 2020), we aim to systematically describe relevant features (clinical phenotype, pathophysiology and management) in patients with severe COVID-19 infection.

Impact of Maternal Immunity on Congenital Cytomegalovirus Birth Prevalence and Infant Outcomes: A Systematic Review.

Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) is the leading non-genetic cause of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), and efforts are geared towards prevention through vaccine development. Transmission rates following primary maternal infection occur at rates of 30-40%, however reported placental rates upon non-primary maternal infection is reported to be less than <4%. There is significant debate about whether this reduction in transmission rate is due to pre-existing maternal immunity, which could identify possible immunologic targets for vaccines. To address this question, we performed a systemic review of the literature using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. We identified cohort studies in high CMV seroprevalent (>80%) areas or in developing regions that examined a cohort of at least 50 infants for congenital CMV acquisition. We identified 19 articles that met criteria and were further categorized based on pre-conception serology, maternal seroprevalence, or previously known seroprevalence. Birth prevalence rates ranged from 0.4% to 6% (median 1.1%), with the studies reporting on clinical outcome (16/19 studies) noting the majority of infected infants as asymptomatic. We also utilized a recent study that differentiated primary maternal infections from chronic infections in a highly seropositive population to calculate a placental transmission rate in women with pre-existing immunity compared to that of no pre-existing immunity. This work confirms a low cCMV birth prevalence in highly seropositive populations, indicates via a calculated placental transmission rate that the CMV placental transmission rate is lower in non-primary infection than that of primary infection, and reveals gaps in data for further research aiming to identify targets for vaccine development.

Laser scanning in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) for evaluating human corneal sub-basal nerve plexus parameters: protocol for a systematic review.

INTRODUCTION Laser scanning in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) enables non-invasive, high-resolution imaging of the cornea. In recent years, there has been a vast increase in researchers using laser scanning IVCM to image and quantify corneal nerve parameters. However, a range of methodological approaches have been adopted. The primary aim of this systematic review is to critically appraise the reported method(s) of primary research studies that have used laser scanning IVCM to quantify corneal sub-basal nerve plexus (SBNP) parameters in humans, and to examine corneal nerve parameters in healthy individuals. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic review of primary studies that have used laser scanning IVCM to quantify SBNP parameters in humans will be conducted. Comprehensive electronic searches will be performed in Ovid MedLine, Embase and the Cochrane Library. Two reviewers will independently assess titles and abstracts, and exclude studies not meeting the inclusion criteria. For studies judged eligible or potentially eligible, full texts will be independently assessed by two reviewers to determine eligibility. A third reviewer will resolve any discrepancies in judgement. Risk of bias will be assessed using a custom tool, covering five methodological domains: participant selection, method of image capture, method of image analysis, data reporting and other sources of bias. A systematic narrative synthesis of findings will be provided. A multilevel random-effects meta-analysis will be performed for corneal nerve parameters derived from healthy participants. This review will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION As this review considers published data, ethical approval is not required. We foresee that this synthesis will serve as a reference for future studies, and can be used to inform best practice standards for using IVCM in clinical research. A manuscript reporting the results of the review will be published and may also be presented at scientific conferences.

Taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes.

BACKGROUND Global prevalence of overweight and obesity are alarming. For tackling this public health problem, preventive public health and policy actions are urgently needed. Some countries implemented food taxes in the past and some were subsequently abolished. Some countries, such as Norway, Hungary, Denmark, Bermuda, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Navajo Nation (USA), specifically implemented taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods. These taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods are fiscal policy interventions, implemented to decrease their consumption and in turn reduce adverse health-related, economic and social effects associated with these food products. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods in the general population on the consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, the prevalence and incidence of overweight and obesity, and the prevalence and incidence of other diet-related health outcomes. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase and 15 other databases and trials registers on 12 September 2019. We handsearched the reference list of all records of included studies, searched websites of international organisations and institutions, and contacted review advisory group members to identify planned, ongoing or unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA We included studies with the following populations: children (0 to 17 years) and adults (18 years or older) from any country and setting. Exclusion applied to studies with specific subgroups, such as people with any disease who were overweight or obese as a side-effect of the disease. The review included studies with taxes on or artificial increases of selling prices for unprocessed sugar or food products that contain added sugar (e.g. sweets, ice cream, confectionery, and bakery products), or both, as intervention, regardless of the taxation level or price increase. In line with Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) criteria, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (nRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. We included controlled studies with more than one intervention or control site and ITS studies with a clearly defined intervention time and at least three data points before and three after the intervention. Our primary outcomes were consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. Our secondary outcomes were substitution and diet, expenditure, demand, and other health outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened all eligible records for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and performed data extraction.Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS We retrieved a total of 24,454 records. After deduplicating records, 18,767 records remained for title and abstract screening. Of 11 potentially relevant studies, we included one ITS study with 40,210 household-level observations from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey. The baseline ranged from January 2008 to August 2011, the intervention was implemented on September 2011, and follow-up was until December 2012 (16 months). The intervention was a tax - the so-called 'Hungarian public health product tax' - on sugar-added foods, including selected foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value. The intervention includes co-interventions: the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and of foods high in salt or caffeine. The study provides evidence on the effect of taxing foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value on the consumption of sugar-added foods. After implementation of the Hungarian public health product tax, the mean consumption of taxed sugar-added foods (measured in units of kg) decreased by 4.0% (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.040, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.07 to -0.01; very low-certainty evidence). The study was at low risk of bias in terms of performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias, with the shape of effect pre-specified and the intervention unlikely to have any effect on data collection. The study was at unclear risk of attrition bias and at high risk in terms of other bias and the independence of the intervention. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for the primary and secondary outcomes. The Hungarian public health product tax included a tax on sugar-added foods but did not include a tax on unprocessed sugar. We did not find eligible studies reporting on the taxation of unprocessed sugar. No studies reported on the primary outcomes of consumption of unprocessed sugar, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. No studies reported on the secondary outcomes of substitution and diet, demand, and other health outcomes. No studies reported on differential effects across population subgroups. We could not perform meta-analyses or pool study results. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There was very limited evidence and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Despite the reported reduction in consumption of taxed sugar-added foods, we are uncertain whether taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods has an effect on reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes. Further robustly conducted studies are required to draw concrete conclusions on the effectiveness of taxing unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes.

Involvement of XBP1s in Blue Light-Induced A2E-Containing Retinal Pigment Epithelium Cell Death.

PURPOSE Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell dysfunction is essential to the development of retinal degenerative disease. This study was designed to investigate how spliced X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1s) regulates different modes of RPE cell death in vitro. METHODS Human ARPE19 cells were incubated with 25 μM N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A2E) and irradiated with blue light. Expressions of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and XBP1s were detected by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot. STF-083010 was used to suppress XBP1s expression. ARPE19 cell apoptosis was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling and flow cytometry. Receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIP3) was detected by Western blot. Changes in the morphology of ARPE19 cells were identified by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS Blue light-induced A2E-containing ARPE19 cell damage caused a transient elevation of GRP78 and XBP1s, while RIP3 rose in the late stage. STF-083010 effectively inhibited XBP1s expression and brought about the aggravation of apoptosis together with an alleviation of RIP3 expression. Most of the dying cells exhibited apoptotic morphology. CONCLUSION A2E, along with blue light, brought about apoptosis and necroptosis of ARPE19 cells, and XBP1s was transiently elevated. The suppression of XBP1s induced ARPE19 cell death by promoting apoptosis rather than necroptosis. XBP1s might play a role in the pathogenesis of retinal degenerative diseases.

Single-Incision Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernioplasty Versus Conventional Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernioplasty.

PURPOSE Additional studies comparing single-incision laparoscopic inguinal hernioplasty (SILH) and conventional laparoscopic inguinal hernioplasty (CLH) have been published, and this study updates the meta-analysis of this subject. METHODS Two reviewers independently searched the PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library electronic databases to locate original articles that compared SILH and CLH for inguinal hernia that were published until October 2015. Operative time, conversions, complications, length of hospital stay, recurrence, postoperative pain at 24 hours, and postoperative pain at 7 days were compared using Stata software, version 12.0. RESULTS Sixteen studies were selected for this analysis, which included a total of 1672 patients (907 in SILH and 765 in CLH). SILH showed a longer operative time; however, conversions, complications, length of hospital stay, recurrence, postoperative pain at 24 hours, and postoperative pain at 7 days were similar between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS Our meta-analysis has shown that inguinal hernia repair using SILH is as safe as CLH. However, based on our evidence, we currently believe that SILH is not an efficacious surgical alternative to CLH for inguinal hernias due to the fact that it does not provide significant benefit in postoperative pain and cosmetic outcomes. However, large-scale, well-designed, and multicenter studies will be needed to further confirm the results of this study.

Golden tracheal secretions and bronchoalveolar fluid during acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease.

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is the leading cause of ICU admission in patients with sickle cell disease and is characterized by golden sputum, which is commonly attributed to the presence of bilirubin. Three young consecutive patients with homozygous sickle cell disease were admitted for severe acute respiratory syndrome due to ACS. In all 3 patients, tracheal secretions and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) showed a yellowish plasma-like stain. After normalization for the plasma-to-BAL urea ratio, BALF protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels were consistent with an exudative process. BALF bilirubin concentrations were very low, implying that the yellowish stain was not related to bilirubin content. The yellowish coloration of tracheal secretions and BALF observed during ACS appears to be related to an intense exudative process rather than to the presence of bilirubin.

Sevoflurane-induced changes in infants' quantifiable electroencephalogram parameters.

BACKGROUND Electroencephalogram (EEG) based depth of anesthesia algorithms developed in the adult population have not demonstrated the same reliability when applied to infants. This may be due to frequency changes occurring in the EEG during development. Amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) is based primarily in the time domain and hence may have greater utility in infants. OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between age adjusted Minimal Alveolar Concentration (MAC) multiples and aEEG in children under 2 years of age. METHODS The aEEG, Spectral Edge Frequency 90% (SEF90) and Bispectral Index™ (BIS) were investigated in a prospective study of children <2 years of age. After anesthetic induction, and caudal block administration, EEG data were collected simultaneously with BrainZ BRM2™ and BIS™ monitors. Using a randomized crossover design, children received up to three age adjusted concentrations of sevoflurane: 0.75, 1 and 1.25 MAC. After 15 min of stable anesthetic delivery EEG readings were obtained. Prediction Probability (Pk ) and correlation coefficients were calculated for each EEG parameter. RESULTS From 51 children 102 stable anesthetics concentrations were obtained. For all age groups Pk of aEEG to multiple of age adjusted MAC was <0.72 indicating a poor predictive power for aEEG. In contrast for the SEF90 and BIS there was evidence for better predictive properties in children aged between 6 months and 2 years, with a Pk >0.81. CONCLUSION The aEEG is unlikely to be a useful measure of anesthesia depth in young children.

Safety of gadolinium-based contrast material in sickle cell disease.

PURPOSE To assess the safety of intravenously administered gadolinium-based contrast material in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS All pediatric and adult SCD patients evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at our institution between January 1995 and July 2009 were identified. The medical records of SCD patients who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI as well as an equal-sized cohort of SCD patients who underwent unenhanced MRI were reviewed for adverse (vaso-occlusive and hemolytic) events within 1 week following imaging. RESULTS Eight (five mild and three moderate) adverse events were documented within 1 week following contrast-enhanced MRI (38 patients and 61 contrast injections), while six (five mild and one moderate) similar events occurred within 1 week following unenhanced MRI (61 patients and 61 unenhanced MRI examinations). This difference in the number of adverse events was not statistically significant (odds ratio = 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4, 5.2). No severe adverse event occurred in either patient cohort. CONCLUSION Gadolinium-based contrast materials do not appear to be associated with increased risk of vaso-occlusive or hemolytic adverse events when administered to SCD patients. Larger, prospective studies using multiple gadolinium-based contrast materials would be useful to confirm the results of our investigation.

A model describing the use of a bronchial blocking device and a sheathed bronchoscope for pulmonary aspiration studies in the Gottingen minipig.

The administration of test substances into a single lung, or lung lobe, allows the remaining untreated lung to act as an experimental control and effectively halves the number of animals required in a given experiment. It reduces the likelihood of early fatal pulmonary failure when noxious substances are studied which may lessen the need for replacement animals. However, the ease of substance administration and the subsequent analysis of its effects, for example by bronchoalveolar lavage or bronchoscopy, depend critically on the size of the animal model. The advantages of using minipigs; ease of handling, reduced housing requirements, genetic homogeneity, etc. are reduced if their diminutive size makes lung studies difficult. This article describes the use of a bronchial blocking device and a sheathed bronchoscope which enabled sterile endobronchial substance administration in Göttingen minipigs, and allowed pulmonary aspiration studies to be conducted with each animal acting as its own control.

Burkholderia mallei CLH001 Attenuated Vaccine Strain Is Immunogenic and Protects against Acute Respiratory Glanders.

Burkholderia mallei is the causative agent of glanders, an incapacitating disease with high mortality rates in respiratory cases. Its endemicity and ineffective treatment options emphasize its public health threat and highlight the need for a vaccine. Live attenuated vaccines are considered the most viable vaccine strategy for Burkholderia, but single-gene-deletion mutants have not provided complete protection. In this study, we constructed the select-agent-excluded B. mallei ΔtonB Δhcp1 (CLH001) vaccine strain and investigated its ability to protect against acute respiratory glanders. Here we show that CLH001 is attenuated, safe, and effective at protecting against lethal B. mallei challenge. Intranasal administration of CLH001 to BALB/c and NOD SCID gamma (NSG) mice resulted in complete survival without detectable colonization or abnormal organ histopathology. Additionally, BALB/c mice intranasally immunized with CLH001 in a prime/boost regimen were fully protected against lethal challenge with the B. mallei lux (CSM001) wild-type strain.

Long-term survival following percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of colorectal lung metastases.

PURPOSE To retrospectively evaluate long-term survival outcomes of radiofrequency (RF) ablation of colorectal lung metastases and evaluate factors associated with improved survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighty-four patients (46 male and 38 female; median age, 65 y) with 172 colorectal lung metastases (median size, 1.2 cm) underwent 113 RF ablation sessions. Thirteen patients had viable extrapulmonary recurrences at the time of RF ablation. The primary endpoint was patient survival. Prognostic factors associated with survival were determined by univariate and multivariate analyses. Secondary endpoints were local tumor progression and adverse events (per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0). RESULTS During follow-up (median duration, 37.5 mo), 36 patients (42.9%) died. The estimated overall survival (OS) rates were 95.2%, 65.0%, and 51.6% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively (median OS time, 67.0 mo). Multivariate analysis revealed that a carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level of at least 5 ng/mL before RF ablation (P = .03) and the presence of viable extrapulmonary recurrences at the time of RF ablation (P = .001) were independent negative prognostic factors. The local tumor progression rate was 14.0% (24 of 172 tumors). Grade 3 adverse events were observed after two sessions (1.8%), and grade 4/5 adverse events were not observed. CONCLUSIONS RF ablation of colorectal lung metastases provided favorable long-term survival with a low incidence of severe adverse events. Independent prognostic factors were a high CEA level before RF ablation and the presence of viable extrapulmonary recurrences at the time of RF ablation.

The use of barbed suture for laparoscopic hysterectomy and myomectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

We conducted a meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of laparoscopic suturing with or without barbed suture for myomectomy or hysterectomy. We used a systematic electronic search strategy of published literature using the following databases: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase, and OVID MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations databases. The following medical subject heading terms, key words, and their combinations were used: laparoscopy, myomectomy, hysterectomy, and barbed suture. Studies in which women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy or hysterectomy using barbed suture or conventional suture were selected. The main outcome measures chosen for the current meta-analysis were operative time, suturing time, estimated blood loss or change in hemoglobin level, and degree of suturing difficulty. The results of the meta-analysis studies were expressed as the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Compared with the use of conventional suture, the total operative time of laparoscopic myomectomy (SMD = -0.58; 95% CI, -0.88 to -0.28) and the suturing time to close the uterine incision (SMD = -1.38; 95% CI, -1.86 to -0.90) were significantly reduced with the use of barbed suture. Meta-analysis on laparoscopic hysterectomy shows that the time to suture the vaginal vault, the total operative time, and the estimated blood loss were comparable with or without the use of barbed suture. The degree of suturing difficulty was reported in 2 randomized trials. Compared with the use of conventional suture, the degree of suturing difficulty was lower with the use of barbed suture (SMD = -1.39; 95% CI, -1.83 to -0.95). The use of barbed suture facilitates laparoscopic suturing of myomectomy incision and closure of the vaginal vault. Its use is associated with a reduced operative time of laparoscopic myomectomy.

Inactivating Three Interferon Antagonists Attenuates Pathogenesis of an Enteric Coronavirus.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) have repeatedly emerged from wildlife hosts into humans and livestock animals to cause epidemics with significant morbidity and mortality. CoVs infect various organs including respiratory and enteric systems, as exemplified by the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. The constellation of viral factors that contribute to developing enteric disease remains elusive. Here, we investigated CoV interferon antagonists for their contribution to enteric pathogenesis. Using an infectious clone of an enteric CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (icPEDV), we generated viruses with inactive versions of interferon antagonist nonstructural proteins 1, 15, and 16 individually, or combined in one virus designated icPEDV-mut4. Interferon-responsive PK1 cells were infected with these viruses and produced higher levels of interferon responses, as compared to wild-type icPEDV infection. icPEDV-mut4 elicited robust interferon responses and was severely impaired for replication in PK1 cells. To evaluate viral pathogenesis, piglets were infected with either icPEDV or icPEDV-mut4. While the icPEDV-infected piglets exhibited clinical disease, the icPEDV-mut4-infected piglets showed no clinical symptoms and exhibited normal intestinal pathology at day 2 post-infection. The icPEDV-mut4 replicated in the intestinal tract, as revealed by detection of viral RNA in fecal swabs, with sequence analysis documenting genetic stability of the input strain. Importantly, icPEDV-mut4 infection elicited IgG and neutralizing antibody responses to PEDV. These results identify nsp1, nsp15, and nsp16 as virulence factors that contribute to the development of PEDV-induced diarrhea in swine. Inactivating these CoV interferon antagonists is a rational approach for generating candidate vaccines to prevent disease and spread of enteric CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2.Author summary Emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and porcine CoVs, can infect enterocytes, cause diarrhea, and be shed in the feces. New approaches are needed to understand enteric pathogenesis and develop vaccines and therapeutics to prevent the spread of these viruses. Here, we exploit a reverse genetic system for an enteric CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and outline an approach of genetically inactivating highly conserved viral factors known to limit the host innate immune response to infection. Our study reveals that generating PEDV with inactive versions of three viral interferon antagonists, nonstructural proteins 1, 15 and 16, results in a highly attenuated virus that does not cause diarrhea in animals, and elicits a neutralizing antibody response in virus-infected animals. This strategy may be useful for generating live-attenuated vaccine candidates that prevent disease and fecal spread of enteric CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2.

COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus: implications for prognosis and clinical management.

INTRODUCTION COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that emerged from Wuhan, China in December 2019, and within 3 months became a global pandemic. AREAS COVERED PubMed search of published data on COVID-19, respiratory infections, and diabetes mellitus (DM). DM associates with impairments of both cellular and humoral immunity. Early emergent global data reveal that severity of clinical outcome from COVID-19 infection (including hospitalization and admission to Intensive Care Unit [ICU]), associate with co-morbidities, prominently DM. The key principles of management of COVID-19 in patients with DM include ongoing focused outpatient management (remotely where necessary) and maintenance of good glycemic control. EXPERT OPINION We will remember the dawn of the third decade of the twenty-first century as a time when the world changed, the true scale and impact of which is hard for us to imagine. Like a phoenix from the ashes though, COVID-19 provides us with a great learning opportunity to renew insights into ourselves as individuals, our clinical teams, and the optimized provision of care for our patients. COVID-19 has re-shaped and re-focused our collective societal values, with a sea-changed shift from materialistic to human-centric, from self-centredness to altruism, ultimately for the betterment of patient care and the whole of society.

The Effect of Phase Change Material on Recovery of Neuromuscular Function Following Competitive Soccer Match-Play.

Aim: Cryotherapy is commonly implemented following soccer match-play in an attempt to accelerate the natural time-course of recovery, but the effect of this intervention on neuromuscular function is unknown. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of donning lower-body garments fitted with cooled phase change material (PCM) on recovery of neuromuscular function following competitive soccer match-play. Methods: Using a randomized, crossover design, 11 male semi-professional soccer players wore PCM cooled to 15°C (PCMcold) or left at ambient temperature (PCMamb; sham control) for 3 h following soccer match-play. Pre-, and 24, 48, and 72 h post-match, participants completed a battery of neuromuscular, physical, and perceptual tests. Maximal voluntary contraction force (MVC) and twitch responses to electrical (femoral nerve) and magnetic (motor cortex) stimulation (TMS) during isometric knee-extension and at rest were measured to assess central nervous system (CNS) (voluntary activation, VA) and muscle contractile (quadriceps potentiated twitch force, Qtw,pot) function. Fatigue and perceptions of muscle soreness were assessed via visual analog scales, and physical function was assessed through measures of jump [countermovement jump (CMJ) height and reactive strength index (RSI)] performance. A belief questionnaire was completed pre- and post-intervention to determine the perceived effectiveness of each garment. Results: Competitive soccer match-play elicited persistent decrements in MVC, VA measured with femoral nerve stimulation, Qtw,pot, as well as reactive strength, fatigue and muscle soreness (P < 0.05). Both MVC and VA were higher at 48 h post-match after wearing PCMcold compared with PCMamb (P < 0.05). However, there was no effect of PCM on the magnitude or time-course of recovery for any other neuromuscular, physical function, or perceptual indices studied (P > 0.05). The belief questionnaire revealed that players perceived that both PCMcold and PCMamb were moderately effective in improving recovery, with no difference between the two interventions (P = 0.56). Conclusion: Although wearing cooled PCM garments improved MVC and VA 48 h following match-play, the lack of effect on measures of physical function or perceptual responses to match-play suggest that PCM offers a limited benefit to the recovery process. The lack of effect could have been due to the relatively small magnitude of change in most of the outcome measures studied.

Predictors of remission with placebo using an integrated study database from patients with major depressive disorder.

OBJECTIVE To identify predictors of remission with placebo treatment in double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in major depressive disorder (MDD). METHOD A total of 1017 placebo-treated patients with baseline Hamilton Depression rating scale (HAMD) total ≥15 from eight duloxetine RCTs were included. Remission was defined as endpoint (7-8 weeks) HAMD total ≤7. Data were randomly split into training data (N = 813, 80%) for model selection and test data (N = 204, 20%) for validation. Logistic regression and classification and regression tree (CART) methods were used to identify predictors of remission. Predictive accuracy of models was assessed by Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS Baseline predictors for remission with placebo consistently identified with the logistic regression and CART analysis were less severe depressive symptoms (based on HAMD core symptoms), younger age, less anxiety (based on HAMD anxiety/somatization), and shorter current MDD episode duration. Associated cut-off values from the CART method characterized patient groups according to their remission likelihood. However, the predictive accuracy was modest for both methods with areas under the ROC curve of 0.6-0.65 based on test data. CONCLUSION The derived models, although of limited value for predicting remission in individual patients, may be useful for adjusting for placebo effects in clinical trials.

Ex vivo biomechanical comparison of V-LOC 180® absorbable wound closure device and standard polyglyconate suture for diaphragmatic herniorrhaphy in a canine model.

OBJECTIVE To compare 2-0 polyglyconate barbed suture (V-LOC™ 180 Absorbable Wound Closure Device, Covidien, Mansfield, MA) to standard 2-0 monofilament absorbable polyglyconate suture (Maxon™, Covidien) for maximum load to failure and failure mode when used to appose standardized defects in canine diaphragm muscle. STUDY DESIGN Randomized, cadaveric ex vivo mechanical testing. SAMPLE POPULATION Canine cadaveric hemi-diaphragmatic specimens (n = 32 pairs). METHODS Thirty-two cadaveric diaphragm specimens were collected and divided to obtain 64 muscle specimens (9 cm × 4 cm). Paired specimens were bisected in the midpoint of their 9 cm length in the direction of the muscle fibers and apposed using either 2-0 polyglyconate or 2-0 barbed polyglyconate (V-LOC™ 180 Absorbable Wound Closure Device) in a simple continuous pattern. Increasing tension was applied perpendicular to the suture line until specimen failure. Failure mode and maximum load to failure were recorded for each specimen. RESULTS Mean ± SD failure load of simulated herniorrhaphies performed with barbed polyglyconate suture (54.5 ± 10.27 N) was not significantly different than repair with polyglyconate (56.9 ± 10.87 N). Failure mode for both construct types was suture tear out rather than suture failure. CONCLUSIONS Clinical application of 2-0 barbed polyglyconate suture can be considered as an alternative to the use of 2-0 polyglyconate for diaphragmatic herniorrhaphy.

Coronavirus disease 2019: Knowledge, attitude, and practice of pregnant women in a tertiary hospital in Abakaliki, southeast Nigeria.

OBJECTIVE To determine the knowledge, attitude, and practice of antenatal attendees towards COVID-19 in Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Nigeria. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 430 consenting pregnant women attending antenatal clinics between March 1 and May 30, 2020, using pretested questionnaires. RESULTS The mean age and mean gestational age of the respondents were 30.04 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 28.9-31.1) and 26.3 weeks (95% CI 23.3-29.3), respectively. More than four-fifths (82%) of the women believed that COVID-19 is real and their main source of information was mass media. The majority had adequate knowledge of COVID-19. More than half of the respondents said COVID-19 is a curable disease and that chloroquine can be used. The majority showed a good attitude and preventice practice of COVID-19 disease; however, one-fourth (24%) thought that infected individuals should be killed to prevent the spread of the virus. CONCLUSION The study population has good knowledge, attitude, and practice of COVID-19 disease. However, it is worrisome that some respondents thought that infected individuals should be killed. Proper education must be given to the populace to avert these negative attitudes while promoting a positive preventive attitude.

Initial consecutive experience of completely portal robotic pulmonary resection with 4 arms.

BACKGROUND Many general thoracic surgeons are learning robotic pulmonary resection. METHODS We retrospectively compared results of completely portal robot lobectomy with 4 arms (CPRL-4) against propensity-matched controls and results after technical changes to CPRL-4. RESULTS In 14 months, 168 patients underwent robotic pulmonary resection: 7 had metastatic pleural disease, 13 had conversion to open procedures, and 148 had completion robotically (106 lobectomies, 26 wedge resections, 16 segmentectomies). All patients underwent R0 resection and removal of all visible lymph nodes (median of 5 N2, 3 N1 nodal stations, 17 lymph nodes). The 106 patients who underwent CPRL-4 were compared with 318 propensity-matched patients who underwent lobectomy by rib- and nerve-sparing thoracotomy. The robotic group had reduced morbidity (27% vs 38%; P = .05), lower mortality (0% vs 3.1%; P = .11), improved mental quality of life (53 vs 40; P < .001), and shorter hospital stay (2.0 vs 4.0 days; P = .02). Results of CPRL-4 after technical modifications led to reductions in median operative time (3.7 vs 1.9 hours; P < .001) and conversion (12/62 vs 1/106; P < .001). Technical improvements were addition of fourth robotic arm for retraction, vessel loop to guide the stapler, tumor removal above the diaphragm, and carbon dioxide insufflation. CONCLUSIONS The newly refined CPRL-4 is safe and yields an R0 resection with complete lymph node removal. It has lower morbidity, mortality, shorter hospital stay, and better quality of life than rib- and nerve-sparing thoracotomy. Technical advances are possible to shorten and improve the operation.

Physical Activity in Obese Type 2 Diabetes After Gastric Bypass or Medical Management.

BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to compare effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus a multidisciplinary, group-based medical diabetes and weight management program on physical fitness and behaviors. METHODS Physical behavior and fitness were assessed in participants of the study Surgery or Lifestyle With Intensive Medical Management in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SLIMM-T2D) (NCT01073020), a randomized, parallel-group trial conducted at a US academic hospital and diabetes clinic with 18- to 24-month follow-up. Thirty-eight type 2 diabetes patients with hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5% and body mass index 30-42 kg/m2 were randomized to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or the medical program. A 6-minute walk test to evaluate fitness, self-reported physical activity, standardized physical surveys, and cardiometabolic risk assessment were performed at baseline and after intervention. RESULTS Both groups similarly improved 6-minute walk test distance, with greater improvements in oxygen saturation and reduced heart rate after surgery. Self-reported physical activity improved similarly at 18-24 months after interventions, although exercise increased gradually after surgery, whereas early substantial increases in the medical group were not fully sustained. Self-reported total and physical health were similar by Short Form-36 but improved more in the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life survey after surgery. Improvement in cardiovascular risk scores, HbA1c, and body mass index were greater after surgery. CONCLUSION In this small, randomized study, both interventions led to therapeutic lifestyle changes and improved objective and self-reported physical fitness. Greater improvements in heart rate, oxygen saturation, and perceived impact of weight on health were seen after surgery, which could be attributable to greater weight loss. The clinical importance of these improvements with greater weight loss warrants further investigation.

Revisional surgery for failed vertical-banded gastroplasty.

Vertical-banded gastroplasty (VBG) was once a common bariatric procedure. It has fallen out of favor due to the emergence of the adjustable gastric band and late complications including band erosion and stenosis. Options for revision include conversion to a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or VBG reversal via gastrogastrostomy. Patients undergoing revision of a previous VBG were identified. VBG reversal was performed laparoscopically. Conversion to RYGB was performed by both laparotomy and laparoscopy. Perioperative outcomes and long-term weight loss were evaluated. A total of 34 patients with a previous open VBG underwent revision over a nearly 8-year period (January 2003 to September 2010). Conversion to RYGB was performed in 25 (four laparoscopically) and VBG reversal in nine patients. Mean age for all patients was 56.3 years (range 36-70), and VBG had been performed 23 years previously (range 16-30). Patients to undergo VBG reversal were more likely to be male and less likely to be morbidly obese at the time of revision. Operative time and length of stay were shorter for laparoscopic procedures. Complication rates did not differ based on technique or procedure. Patients with a previous VBG may present with complications and obesity decades after the primary procedure. Revisional surgery can be accomplished laparoscopically. Following VBG reversal, most patients gain weight and many become morbidly obese again. Conversion to RYGB is associated with weight loss and resolution of morbid obesity in most patients. When feasible, laparoscopic conversion to RYGB may offer the best outcomes.

Glyco-analytical multispecific proteolysis (Glyco-AMP): a simple method for detailed and quantitative Glycoproteomic characterization.

Despite recent advances, site-specific profiling of protein glycosylation remains a significant analytical challenge for conventional proteomic methodology. To alleviate the issue, we propose glyco-analytical multispecific proteolysis (Glyco-AMP) as a strategy for glycoproteomic characterization. Glyco-AMP consists of rapid, in-solution digestion of an analyte glycoprotein (or glycoprotein mixture) by a multispecific protease (or protease cocktail). Resulting glycopeptides are chromatographically separated by isomer-specific porous graphitized carbon nano-LC, quantified by high-resolution MS, and structurally elucidated by MS/MS. To demonstrate the consistency and customizability of Glyco-AMP methodology, the glyco-analytical performances of multispecific proteases subtilisin, pronase, and proteinase K were characterized in terms of quantitative accuracy, sensitivity, and digestion kinetics. Glyco-AMP was shown be effective on glycoprotein mixtures as well as glycoproteins with multiple glycosylation sites, providing detailed, quantitative, site- and structure-specific information about protein glycosylation.

Stent dislodgement induced by a vasodilator used for severe coronary artery spasm caused by Kounis syndrome.

Coronary stent dislodgement is a rare but critical complication of percutaneous coronary intervention. It can potentially result in serious consequences, such as stent embolization and emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Here, we describe the successful retrieval of an extracoronary dislodged stent, where dislodgement was induced by a vasodilator used for severe coronary artery spasm caused by Kounis syndrome.

Decreased Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation on nanomodified endotracheal tubes: a dynamic lung model.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a serious complication of mechanical ventilation that has been shown to be associated with increased mortality rates and medical costs in the pediatric intensive care unit. Currently, there is no cost-effective solution to the problems posed by VAP. Endotracheal tubes (ETTs) that are resistant to bacterial colonization and that inhibit biofilm formation could provide a novel solution to the problems posed by VAP. The objective of this in vitro study was to evaluate differences in the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on unmodified polyvinyl chloride (PVC) ETTs and on ETTs etched with a fungal lipase, Rhizopus arrhizus, to create nanoscale surface features. These differences were evaluated using an in vitro model of the pediatric airway to simulate a ventilated patient in the pediatric intensive care unit. Each experiment was run for 24 hours and was supported by computational models of the ETT. Dynamic conditions within the ETT had an impact on the location of bacterial growth within the tube. These conditions also quantitatively affected bacterial growth especially within the areas of tube curvature. Most importantly, experiments in the in vitro model revealed a 2.7 log reduction in the number (colony forming units/mL) of P. aeruginosa on the nanoroughened ETTs compared to the untreated PVC ETTs after 24 hours. This reduction in total colony forming units/mL along the x-axis of the tube was similar to previous studies completed for Staphylococcus aureus. Thus, this dynamic study showed that lipase etching can create surface features of nanoscale roughness on PVC ETTs that decrease bacterial attachment of P. aeruginosa without the use of antibiotics and may provide clinicians with an effective and inexpensive tool to combat VAP.

Exploring the mutual constitution of racializing and medicalizing discourses of immigrant tuberculosis in the Canadian press.

Drawing on critical discourse analysis of Canadian press coverage of the immigrant tuberculosis problem, we expose the complex relationship between press-constructed discourses of immigrant health and current tuberculosis control policies in Canada. The focus of these policies is on screening and surveillance of immigrants rather than addressing social inequalities underlying the problem of immigrant tuberculosis. The biomedical focus and racializing character of current policies were reinforced in the Canadian press by depicting tuberculosis as a biomedical (rather than a social) disease imported to Canada by immigrants. The status of the immigrant body as health threat was produced by and through preexisting and mutually constitutive racializing and medicalizing discourses materialized in press coverage and tuberculosis control policies. Deracialization and demedicalization of health information disseminated in the press are potentially important factors to be considered when revising health policies that would address the socioeconomic and political factors that determine the health status of Canadian immigrants.

Fabrication of fillable microparticles and other complex 3D microstructures.

Three-dimensional (3D) microstructures created by microfabrication and additive manufacturing have demonstrated value across a number of fields, ranging from biomedicine to microelectronics. However, the techniques used to create these devices each have their own characteristic set of advantages and limitations with regards to resolution, material compatibility, and geometrical constraints that determine the types of microstructures that can be formed. We describe a microfabrication method, termed StampEd Assembly of polymer Layers (SEAL), and create injectable pulsatile drug-delivery microparticles, pH sensors, and 3D microfluidic devices that we could not produce using traditional 3D printing. SEAL allows us to generate microstructures with complex geometry at high resolution, produce fully enclosed internal cavities containing a solid or liquid, and use potentially any thermoplastic material without processing additives.

Cognitive function after sevoflurane- vs propofol-based anaesthesia for on-pump cardiac surgery: a randomized controlled trial.

BACKGROUND Cognitive dysfunction is a frequent complication after cardiac surgery and has been found to be associated with decreases in cerebral oxygen saturation measured with near-infrared spectroscopy. Sevoflurane has neuroprotective properties in vitro and in animal models. This study was designed to determine cognitive and clinical outcomes after sevoflurane- compared with propofol-based anaesthesia for on-pump cardiac surgery and the impact of decreases in under different anaesthesia regimens. METHODS One hundred and twenty-eight patients were randomly assigned to either i.v. anaesthesia with propofol- (PROP) or sevoflurane-based anaesthesia (SEVO). An intraoperative was defined as desaturation. The Abbreviated Mental Test, Stroop Test, Trail-Making Test, Word Lists, and mood-assessment tests were performed before, 2, 4, and 6 days after cardiac surgery. Markers of general outcome were obtained. RESULTS The analysis groups had differences in baseline cognitive performance. Analysis of variance for repeated measures (incorporating covariance of baseline scores) showed that in three of four cognitive tests, patients with cerebral desaturation showed worse results than patients without desaturation. Patients assigned to sevoflurane-based anaesthesia showed better results in all cognitive tests than patients after propofol. Interactions between the anaesthetic regimen and desaturation were found in all four cognitive tests. There were no differences in markers of organ dysfunction or general clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS Patients with impaired cognitive performance before operation may be at particular risk for intraoperative cerebral insult. A sevoflurane-based anaesthesia was associated with better short-term postoperative cognitive performance than propofol.

Transcaval embolization as the preferred approach.

The management of type II endoleaks that develop after endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms now includes the transcaval approach. We reviewed the safety and efficacy of this technique in 10 consecutive patients (82 ± 7 years old; 80% male) who presented with a mean sac enlargement of 1.2 ± 0.7 cm and documented flow within the aortic sac. Patients presented a mean of 5.5 ± 3.1 years after endovascular aneurysm repair, and five (50%) patients had prior attempts at endovascular repair of the documented endoleak. Patients underwent a percutaneous transcaval approach to the aorta with use of the Rösch-Uchida Transjugular Liver Access Kit (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) through an 8F sheath in a biplane angiography room. Coil embolization of the sac and lumbar arteries and occasional use of gelatin granules and human thrombin slurry allowed obliteration of the endoleak. No complications developed. Nine patients (90%) were noted to have a decreased sac diameter on the postprocedure study, and only one (10%) had persistent (but markedly diminished) flow noted on the follow-up ultrasound examination. Follow-up is early and extends to 6 months without recurrence of the endoleaks. The ability to safely access the aortic sac through the vena cava is a potentially efficient, safe, and useful technique to treat aortic endoleaks.

Transmission Potential of SARS-CoV-2 in Viral Shedding Observed at the University of Nebraska Medical Center

Lack of evidence on SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics has led to shifting isolation guidelines between airborne and droplet isolation precautions. During the initial isolation of 13 individuals confirmed positive with COVID-19 infection, air and surface samples were collected in eleven isolation rooms to examine viral shedding from isolated individuals. While all individuals were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2, symptoms and viral shedding to the environment varied considerably. Many commonly used items, toilet facilities, and air samples had evidence of viral contamination, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 is shed to the environment as expired particles, during toileting, and through contact with fomites. Disease spread through both direct (droplet and person-to-person) as well as indirect contact (contaminated objects and airborne transmission) are indicated, supporting the use of airborne isolation precautions.

Evaluate the timing of resumption of business for the states of New York, New Jersey and California via a pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission model of COVID-19

The United States has the highest numbers of confirmed cases and death of COVID-19, where confirmed cases took up nearly half in the hot spot states of New York, New Jersey and California. The workforce in these states was required to work from home except for essential services to minimize the risk of the spread of COVID-19. Premature reopening of economy will lead to broader spread of COVID-19, while the opposite situation would cause greater loss of economy. We proposed an epidemic compartmental model in considering the pre-symptomatic transmission and asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19, to estimate the numbers of unidentified infected cases and simulate the possible outcomes of resumption of economy at different forthcoming Mondays. The states of New York and New Jersey were not recommended to reopen the economy before May 18 since it may increase 22.44% and 60.18% for the numbers of cumulative confirmed cases if the second wave of the infection would happen, respectively. While that may be feasible for California to reopen business on May 11 if appropriate control measures for prevention of the second wave of the infection are implemented, because of the less benefit for delaying reopening the economy and the relatively smaller magnitude of Outbreak of COVID-19.

Can India stay immune enough to combat COVID‐19 pandemic? An economic query

The COVID‐19 pandemic has affected different sectors of the economy in an unprecedented way, and this article is an attempt to analyze the economic effect of the outbreak in India. However, before we assess the economic cost associated with the pandemic, we economists fully consider the outbreak as a human tragedy. There has not been any econometric technique that can account the countless human sufferings that the crisis has brought. Through this article, we address several important research questions and demonstrate India's strength to stay immune to combat COVID‐19 pandemic. The research questions are as follows. First, what will be the effect of COVID‐19 on the Indian economy and how does it affect the different sectors of the economy? Second, how does the pandemic affect the bilateral trade relation between India and China? Third, we question the role of the public health system in dealing with the outbreak of the virus in India. This article also presents the growth projection of the Indian economy by different economic agents. We finally conclude the article by mentioning a few policy recommendations for the Indian economy.

Integrated technology platform for accelerated discovery of antiviral antibody therapeutics

The emergence and reemergence of highly virulent viral pathogens with pandemic potential has created an urgent need for accelerated discovery of antiviral therapeutics. Antiviral human monoclonal (mAbs) are promising drug candidates to prevent or treat severe viral diseases, but the long timelines needed for discovery limits their rapid deployment and use. Here, we report the development of an integrated sequence of technologies incorporating advances in single-cell mRNA sequence analysis, bioinformatics, synthetic biology, and high-throughput functional analysis that allowed us to discover highly potent antiviral human mAbs and validate their activity in vivo at an unprecedented scale, speed, and efficiency. In a 78-day study, modeling deployment of a rapid response platform to an outbreak, we isolated >100 individual Zika virus (ZIKV) specific human mAbs, assessed their function, identified 29 broadly-neutralizing mAbs, and verified therapeutic potency of lead candidates with antibody-encoding mRNA formulation and/or IgG protein delivery in mice and nonhuman primates. Our work provides a roadmap for the rapid antibody discovery programs against viral pathogens of global concern.

Growth factor receptor signaling inhibition prevents SARS-CoV-2 replication

SARS-CoV-2 infections are rapidly spreading around the globe. The rapid development of therapies is of major importance. However, our lack of understanding of the molecular processes and host cell signaling events underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection hinder therapy development. We employed a SARS-CoV-2 infection system in permissible human cells to study signaling changes by phospho-proteomics. We identified viral protein phosphorylation and defined phosphorylation-driven host cell signaling changes upon infection. Growth factor receptor (GFR) signaling and downstream pathways were activated. Drug-protein network analyses revealed GFR signaling as key pathway targetable by approved drugs. Inhibition of GFR downstream signaling by five compounds prevented SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells, assessed by cytopathic effect, viral dsRNA production, and viral RNA release into the supernatant. This study describes host cell signaling events upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and reveals GFR signaling as central pathway essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication. It provides with novel strategies for COVID-19 treatment.

On Linear Growth in COVID-19 Cases

We present an elementary model of COVID-19 propagation that makes explicit the connection between testing strategies and rates of transmission and the linear growth in new cases observed in many parts of the world. An essential feature of the model is that it captures the population-level response to the infection statistics information provided by governments and other organisations. The conclusions from this model have important implications regarding benefits of wide-spread testing for the presence of the virus, something that deserves greater attention.

Whole genome sequencing of human enteroviruses from clinical samples by nanopore direct RNA sequencing

Enteroviruses are small RNA viruses that affect millions of people each year by causing an important burden of disease with a broad spectrum of symptoms. In routine diagnostic laboratories, those viruses are identified by PCR based methods, often combined with partial sequencing for genotyping. In this proof-of-principle study, we assessed direct RNA sequencing (DRS) using nanopore sequencing technology for fast whole-genome sequencing of viruses directly from clinical samples. Results of the approach were complemented with those obtained by sequencing the corresponding viral cDNA via Illumina MiSeq sequencing. DRS of total RNA extracted from three different enterovirus-positive stool samples produced long RNA fragments, covering between 59% to 99.6 % of the best reference genomes. The identification of the enterovirus sequences in the sample was confirmed by the short-read cDNA sequencing. Sequence identity between DRS and Illumina MiSeq enterovirus consensus sequences ranged between 94-97%. Here we show that nanopore DRS can be used to correctly identify the genotypes of enteroviruses from patient stool samples with high viral load.

A targeted e-learning approach to reduce student mixing during a pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread closure of schools and universities. These institutions have turned to distance learning to provide educational continuity. Schools now face the challenge of how to reopen safely and resume in-class learning. However, there is little empirical evidence to guide decision-makers on how this can be achieved. Here, we show that selectively deploying e-learning for larger classes is highly effective at decreasing campus-wide opportunities for student-to-student contact, while allowing most in-class learning to continue uninterrupted. We conducted a natural experiment at a large university that implemented a series of e-learning interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak. Analyses of >24 million student connections to the university Wi-Fi network revealed that population size can be manipulated by e-learning in a targeted manner according to class size characteristics. Student mixing showed accelerated growth with population size according to a power law distribution. Therefore, a small e-learning dependent decrease in population size resulted in a large reduction in student clustering behaviour. Our results show that e-learning interventions can decrease potential for disease transmission while minimizing disruption to university operations. Universities should consider targeted e-learning a viable strategy for providing educational continuity during early or late stages of a disease outbreak.

The impact of containment measures and air temperature on mitigating the transmission of COVID-19: a novel data-based comprehensive modeling analysis

Background The COVID-19 is spreading worldwide, early non-pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) is crucial for mitigating COVID-19 epidemic. We aim to evaluate the impact of containment measures and the epidemic features of COVID-19 under social NPIs in Mainland China. Methods Under the strict social NPIs, the spreading pattern of COVID-19 in China has changed into mostly clustered intra-household or intro-acquaintance transmission, and we established a stochastic NPIs model, named ScEIQRsh to fit the epidemic and NPIs data of each province in China. Results This ScEIQRsh model could be well fitted with both the reported number of accumulative confirmed cases and epidemiological survey (EPS)-based quarantined cases of each province in China. We found that the median transmission rate of COVID-19 among acquaintances was 10.22 (IQR 8.47, 12.35) across Mainland China and the COVID-19 spreading was prevented by NPIs implementation within 25-30 days. Among NPIs, measures to diminish contactable susceptible (Sc), such as staying home, travel constraint etc. and measures to avoid delay of diagnosis and hospitalized isolation ({eta}) were more effective than EPS-based quarantine ({kappa},{rho} or surveyQ). Upon the fitted models, the proportion of asymptomatic infectors was determined to be 14.88% (IQR 8.17%, 25.37%). The median incubation period and communicable period of COVID-19 under NPIs were 4.16 (IQR 3.60, 4.71) and 6.77 (IQR 4.53, 10.36) days respectively, and the median time from exposed to being contagious was 2.39 (IQR 2.26, 2.56) days. Besides, we identified that the optimal temperature for COVID-19 spreading was in the range of 5{degrees}C-14{degrees}C. Conclusion This study provided useful suggestions about NPI strategy for the prevention of COVID-19 spreading, which should be helpful for the control of COVID-19, as well as other similar infectious disease.

Tensions between research and public health: modelling the risks and benefits of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine field trials versus human infection challenge studies.

Background: Human infection challenge studies (HICS) with SARS-CoV-2 are under consideration as a way of accelerating vaccine development. We evaluate potential vaccine research strategies under a range of epidemic conditions determined, in part, by the intensity of public health interventions. Methods: We constructed a compartmental epidemiological model incorporating public health interventions, vaccine efficacy trials and a post-trial population vaccination campaign. The model was used to estimate the duration and benefits of large-scale field trials in comparison with HICS accompanied by an expanded safety trial, and to assess the marginal risk faced by HICS participants. Results: Field trials may demonstrate vaccine efficacy more rapidly than a HICS strategy under epidemic conditions consistent with moderate mitigation policies. A HICS strategy is the only feasible option for testing vaccine efficacy under epidemic suppression, and maximises the benefits of post-trial vaccination. Less successful or absent mitigation results in minimal or no benefit from post-trial vaccination, irrespective of trial design. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 HICS are the optimal method of vaccine testing for populations maintained under epidemic suppression, where vaccination offers the greatest benefits to the local population.

A new estimation method for COVID-19 time-varying reproduction number using active cases

We propose a new method to estimate the time-varying effective (or instantaneous) reproduction number of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The method is based on a discrete-time stochastic augmented compartmental model that describes the virus transmission. A two-stage estimation method, which combines the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate reported state variables (active and removed cases) and a low pass filter based on a rational transfer function to remove short term fluctuations of the reported cases, is used with case uncertainties that are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. Our method does not require information regarding serial intervals, which makes the estimation procedure simpler without reducing the quality of the estimate. We show that the proposed method is comparable to common approaches, e.g., age-structured and new cases based sequential Bayesian models. We also apply it to COVID-19 cases in the Scandinavian countries: Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, where we see a delay of about four days in predicting the epidemic peak.

Possibilities of exponential or Sigmoid growth of Covid19 data in different states of India

We have attempted to understand existing covid19 data of India, where growth of total and new cases with time in different states are kept as focal points. Identifying the last trend of exponential growth, mainly noticed in month of March, we have zoomed in its disaster possibilities by straight forward extrapolation of exponential growth. As a hopeful extrapolation, the existing data might be considered low time-axis values of Sigmoid-type function, whose growth might be saturated to values of 10^4 or 10^5. To fulfill this expectation, a turning from increasing to decreasing trend in new case data should be noticed around April-May, which definitely demand extension of present lock-down with additional interventions.

Work with emotions in remote psychotherapy in the time of Covid-19: a clinical experience

Objective: Face-to-face experiential work with emotions is effective, but it remains unclear what the feasibility of teletherapeutic work with emotions is. The current Covid-19 worldwide situation represents an opportunity for psychotherapists to test new ways of working with clients, including from an emotion-focused and emotionally focused perspective. Methods: The present brief report describes a clinical experience based on 6 weeks, so far, of telepsychotherapeutic work focused on emotions via online tools, during the Covid-19 partial confinement in Switzerland. Results: We found a certain feasibility of remote work with emotions in psychotherapy, for individual clients, and for couples. Specific challenges represent relationship and contextual factors (clear communication, using tone of voice, regular check ins, setting up a clear frame, technical aspects of communication, the Self of the therapist), accessing and deepening emotions and managing dysregulated experience and interpersonal escalation. Discussion: Based on this initial clinical experience, we propose that integrative experiential practice partially delivered via a computer screen be studied in controlled settings by psychotherapy research in the future.

COVID-19 cases are less prevalent in countries where malaria is endemic, suggesting a role for anti-malarial drugs as prophylaxis

Almost every country across the world has felt the repercussions of the pandemic of disease termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A recently published article points to a method of prevention and prophylaxis of COVID-19 through the use of anti-malarial drugs such as the 4-aminoquinolones: chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, based on their mechanisms of action against SARS-CoV-2. This report aims to explore the correlation between COVID-19 cases and countries where malaria is prevalent using statistical means. It is hypothesized that countries where malaria is endemic will have few cases of COVID-19 since these countries use the 4-aminoquinolone antimalarial drugs for prophylaxis. Statistical analysis demonstrates that the numbers and incidence of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths are substantially lower (multiple-fold lower) in countries with the highest prevalence of malaria. The difference between both the COVID-19 incidence rate and the COVID-19 mortality rate in malaria prevalent countries compared to COVID-19 prevalent countries is statistically significant (p = 0.02 and p = 0.04 respectively). This study provides further evidence that anti-malaria drugs may prove essential to breaking the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and preventing COVID-19 and COVID-19 related mortality. As the pandemic continues to evolve and doctors and researchers across the globe try to attenuate or stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the medical community should not overlook the potential role of the 4-aminoquinolones anti-malarial drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and 8-aminoquinolone anti-malaria drugs, tafenoquine and primaquine, as a prophylaxis.

Open source 3D printed Ventilation Device

COVID-19 is an acute respiratory tract infection caused by a coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. The common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, breathing difficulties, dry cough, fever, and in some patients, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and death. 312,009 deaths from COVID-19 has been reported as of today. While respiratory symptoms are commonly caused by the infection, the use of mechanical ventilation is required for some patients. The following is intended to review the development and testing of a 3D printed and open-source mechanical ventilation device that is capable of adjusting breathing rate, volume, and pressure simultaneously and was designed according to the latest clinical observations of the current pandemic. The intuitive design of this device along with the use of primarily 3D printed or readily available components allow the rapid manufacturing and transportation of this ventilation device to the impacted regions.

Evolution of COVID19 new cases in 16 countries and Scenarios for Brazil using metaphorical analysis of Board, Inverted Pyramid and Papyri

Since the end of 2019, the world has become aware of a new virus that has emerged in China, which in February 2020 was called by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2019) as Coronavirus disease (COVID19) Due to its fast transmission, at 18:32 (GMT) on March 29, 2020, the world has officially accounted for about 710,950 new confirmed cases with 33,553 deaths and 150,734 recovered cases (Worldometers, 2020) The pandemic has become the newest challenge for several nations, especially the USA, Italy, China, Spain, Germany, Iran, for being the most affected, and since Brazil is a continental country with disabilities in its Unified Health System, it could be in the next two months among the five most affected Thus, the main objective of the research is analyze the evolution of new cases of COVID19 in 16 countries to present short-term scenarios and recommendations for Brazil to face the pandemic The research is applied, as its results and recommendations can be applied with adaptation by government authorities, business managers and citizens The research is descriptive, with a qualitative and quantitative approach, based on bibliographic and documentary research, involving the study of articles, reports, manuals and other technical documents related to the subject For the creation of scenarios, data collection focused on the number of new cases registered in 16 countries, including Brazil, as well as in the development of an approach using metaphorical analysis of the Board, the Inverted Pyramid and Papyri The main conclusion is that even though no country is prepared to face epidemics and pandemics (NTI, JHU and EIU, 2019), among the 16 countries investigated, Thailand, Finland, Australia, South Korea, Denmark and Sweden are benchmarks that Brazil could study in order not to repeat the scenarios of China, USA, Italy and Spain At the end, ten recommendations are made for future research and also to public and private managers

Controlled Avalanche: A Regulated Voluntary Exposure Approach for Addressing Covid19

Background: The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has driven many countries to take radical suppression measures. While reducing mortality, these measures result in severe economic repercussions, and inhibit the development of herd immunity. Until an effective vaccine will be available, we propose an alternative approach, akin to avalanche control at ski resorts, a practice which intentionally triggers small avalanches in order to prevent a singular catastrophic one. Its main goal is to approach herd immunity faster than the current alternatives, with lower mortality rates and lower demand for critical health-care resources. According to this approach, individuals whose probability of developing serious health conditions is low (i.e. 20-49 years old with no comorbidities) will be offered the option to be voluntarily exposed to the virus under controlled supervision, and will then be issued 'immunity certificates' if they are confirmed to have developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods: Using a compartmental model we examine the implications of the controlled avalanche (CA) strategy over the population in Israel. We compare four scenarios: in two scenarios the CA program is applied to the low-risk population (with the rest of the population subject to mitigation measures), followed by mitigation for the entire population or by uncontrolled spread. These are compared to mitigated and uncontrolled scenarios without the CA program. We discuss the economic, ethical and public health implications of the CA strategy. Findings: We show that compared to mitigation of the entire population, the CA strategy reduces the overall mortality by 43%, reduces the maximum number of people in need for ICUs by 62% and decreases the time required for release of 50% of the low-risk population by more than 2 months. Interpretation: This study suggests an ethically acceptable practice, that enables reaching herd immunity faster than the current alternatives, with low mortality and minimal economic damage.

A simple mathematical model for Coronavirus (COVID-19)

A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China in the end of 2019, it causing an outbreak of viral pneumonia. It caused to the death rate of 4:63% among 571; 678 confirmed cases around the world to the March 28th, 2020. In this brief current study, we will present a simple mathematical model where we show how the probability of successfully getting infected when coming into contact with an infected individual and the per capita contact rate affect the healthy and infected population with time. The proposed model is used to offer predictions about the behavior of COVID-19 for a shorter period of time.

Nonstructural proteins of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)

Abstract Coronaviruses (CoVs) are pathogens that infect a large variety of vertebrate animals, resulting in mainly respiratory and enteric diseases An epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in China in 2002, and the causative agent was designated as SARS-CoV Ten years after the SARS outbreak, another highly pathogenic human CoV, designated as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, emerged in Saudi Arabia Now, we faces on an epidemic of Novel coronavirus, (SARS-CoV-2) The nonstructural protein (nsp) 1 of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are the most studied among CoVs and are known to inhibit host gene expression by translational shutoff and host mRNA degradation This two-pronged strategy of nsp1 inhibits expression of the IFN gene Murine models of SARS-CoV have revealed that the dysregulated type I IFN response is a key factor for inducing lethal pneumonia These accumulated data indicate that the nsp1 of CoV is a major virulence factor We speculate that the nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 has similar function to SARS and MERS-CoV

A virus that has gone viral: Amino acid mutation in S protein of Indian isolate of Coronavirus COVID-19 might impact receptor binding and thus infectivity

Since 2002, beta coronaviruses (CoV) have caused three zoonotic outbreaks, SARS-CoV in 2002, MERS-CoV in 2012, and the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 late in 2019 (also named as COVID-19 or novel coronavirus 2019 or nCoV2019. Spike(S) protein, one of the structural proteins of this virus plays key role in receptor (ACE2) binding and thus virus entry. Thus, this protein has attracted scientists for detailed study and therapeutic targeting. As the 2019 novel coronavirus takes its course throughout the world, more and more sequence analyses are been done and genome sequences getting deposited in various databases. From India two clinical isolates have been sequenced and the full genome deposited in GenBank. We have performed sequence analyses of the spike protein of the Indian isolates and compared with that of the Wuhan, China (where the outbreak was first reported). While all the sequences of Wuhan isolates are identical, we found point mutations in the Indian isolates. Out of the two isolates one was found to harbour a mutation in its Receptor binding domain (RBD) at position 407. At this site arginine (a positively charged amino acid) was replaced by isoleucine (a hydrophobic amino acid that is also a C-beta branched amino acid). This mutation has been seen to change the secondary structure of the protein at that region and this can potentially alter receptor ding of the virus. Although this finding needs further validation and more sequencing, the information might be useful in rational drug designing and vaccine engineering.

Induction of RNA interference by C. elegans mitochondrial dysfunction via the DRH-1/RIG-I homologue RNA helicase and the EOL-1/RNA decapping enzyme

RNA interference (RNAi) is an antiviral pathway common to many eukaryotes that detects and cleaves foreign nucleic acids. In mammals, mitochondrially localized proteins such as MAVS, RIG-I, and MDA5 mediate antiviral responses. Here, we report that mitochondrial dysfunction in Caenorhabditis elegans activates RNAi-directed silencing via induction of a pathway homologous to the mammalian RIG-I helicase viral response pathway. The induction of RNAi also requires the conserved RNA decapping enzyme EOL-1/DXO. The transcriptional induction of eol-1 requires DRH-1 as well as the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). Upon mitochondrial dysfunction, EOL-1 is concentrated into foci that depend on the transcription of mitochondrial RNAs that may form dsRNA, as has been observed in mammalian antiviral responses. The enhanced RNAi triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the increase in longevity that is induced by mitochondrial dysfunction.

Asymptomatic carriage rates and case-fatality of SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents and staff in Irish nursing homes

Background: SARS-CoV-2 has disproportionately affected nursing home (NH) residents. In Ireland, the first NH case of COVID-19 occurred on 16/03/2020. A national point-prevalence testing program of all NH residents and staff took place from 18/04/2020-05/05/2020. Aims: To examine characteristics of NHs across three Community Health Organisations (CHOs) in Ireland, proportions with COVID-19 outbreaks, staff and resident, symptom-profile and resident case-fatality. Methods: Forty-five NHs surveyed across three CHOs requesting details on occupancy, size, COVID-19 outbreak, timing of outbreak, total symptomatic/asymptomatic cases, and outcomes for residents from 29/02/2020-22/05/2020. Results: Surveys were returned from (62.2%, 28/45) of NHs (2043 residents, 2303 beds). Three-quarters (21/28) had COVID-19 outbreaks (1741 residents, 1972 beds). Median time from first case of COVID-19 in Ireland to first case in these NHs was 27.0 days. Resident COVID-19 incidence was (43.9%, 764/1741): laboratory-confirmed (40.1%, 710/1741) with (27.2%, 193/710 asymptomatic), and clinically-suspected (3.1%, 54/1741). Resident case-fatality was (27.6%, 211/764) for combined laboratory-confirmed/clinically-suspected COVID-19. Similar proportions of residents in NH with an early outbreak (<28days) versus a later outbreak developed confirmed/suspected COVID-19. A lower proportion of residents in NHs with early outbreaks had recovered compared to those with late outbreaks (37.4% vs 61.7%; X2=56.9, p<0.001). Among 675 NH staff across twenty-four sites who had confirmed/suspected COVID-19 (23.6%, 159/675) were asymptomatic. There was a significant correlation between the proportion of staff with symptomatic COVID-19 and resident numbers with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 (Spearmans rho=0.81, p<0.001). Conclusion: This study demonstrates COVID-19 impact on NH residents and staff. High infection rates lead to challenges in care provision.

Viral Dynamics Matter in COVID-19 Pneumonia: the success of early treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in Lebanon.

Background: We share our experience in COVID-19 pneumonia management at Saint George Hospital University Medical Center (SGHUMC) in Lebanon. In the absence of a standard of care, early diagnosis and opt-in therapy with Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin were offered. Methods: We reviewed records of COVID-19 pneumonia patients from March 16-April 26 2020. Based on NEWS score, we stratified patients as A: low B: medium, and C: high clinical severity and obtained pharmacotherapy data. Chest-CT-severity-score (CTSS) was used. We defined clinical cure as resolution of symptoms and biomarkers and virologic cure as a PCR above 35 cycles(Ct). Results: We recorded 21 COVID-19 pneumonia patients of whom 19 opted for treatment. Clinical symptoms and laboratory markers at presentation did not significantly correlate with severity. Lower initial viral load significantly correlated with lower levels of clinical and radiological severity (p=0.038). Virologic cure, Ct>35, by day 10, was only 33% in high severity significantly less than categories A and B. We observed 100% clinical cure at day 10 in Category-A, 67% in B, and 33% in C(p<0.05). Patients with the lowest severity had the fastest virologic cure in a mean of 5.8 days from diagnosis, shortest hospitalization and earlier radiological improvement(p<0.005). Ultimately, 18 patients were discharged home in good condition and one remains in the ICU. Conclusion: Viral dynamics matter in COVID-19 pneumonia. An early control of replication may be crucial in averting complications. Early administration of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin potentially explains our 94.7% success rate in treating a fairly complex cohort of COVID-19 pneumonia.

Repurposed prophylaxis strategies for COVID-19: a systematic review

Introduction Efficient therapeutic strategies are needed to counter the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS- CoV-2 virus. In a context where specific vaccines are not yet available, the containment of the pandemic would be facilitated with efficient prophylaxis. Methods We screened several clinical trials repositories and platforms in search of the prophylactic strategies that are investigated against COVID-19 in late April 2020. Results Up to April 27, 2020, we found 68 clinical trials targeting medical workers (n=43, 63%), patients relatives (n=16, 24%) or individuals at risk of severe COVID-19 (n=5, 7%). (Hydroxy)chloroquine was the most frequently evaluated treatment (n=46, 68%), before BCG vaccine (n=5, 7%). Sixty-one (90%) clinical trials were randomized with a median of planned inclusions of 600 (IQR 255-1515). Conclusion The investigated prophylaxis strategies cover both pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis and study numerous immune enhancers and antivirals, although most research efforts are focused on (hydroxy)chloroquine.

Fevers Are Rarest in the Morning: Could We Be Missing Infectious Disease Cases by Screening for Fever Then?

Body temperatures are less likely to reach the fever range in the morning, but it is unknown how this affects practice during disease outbreaks. We retrospectively investigated fever-range temperatures ([≥]100.4{degrees}F, [≥]38.0{degrees}C) during seasonal influenza outbreaks and the 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic, which have recently been used as preparatory models for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our analyses included a nationally representative sample of records from adult visits to US emergency departments (n=202,181) and data from a Boston emergency department (n=93,225). Fever-range temperatures were about half as common in the morning as in the evening, suggesting that morning temperatures can be much less diagnostic, and that revisions may be needed to the practice of once-daily temperature screens at morning arrival to workplaces and schools. Twice-daily screens could be a simple solution, but similar research is still needed on fevers in COVID-19 itself.

THE PATHOGENESIS OF THROMBOEMBOLIC DISEASE IN COVID-19 PATIENTS: COULD BE A CATASTROPHIC ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME?

Background The most severely COVID-19 patients need intensive care and show increased risk of thromboembolic events. Although some patients meet the diagnostic criteria for the Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation, the pathogenesis of the diffuse thrombotic status remains unclear. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in sera of deceased patients with autoptic proven thrombotic microangiopathy to evaluate if some patients may have developed Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome (CAPS). Methods Thirty-five patients were enrolled. The available medical history, comorbidities, therapies, laboratory and autopsy findings were collected post-mortem from clinical records. IgA, IgG and IgM anti cardiolipin (ACA) and anti {beta}2 glycoprotein 1 ({beta}2GP1) antibodies, IgG and IgM anti phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (PS/PT) antibodies were tested for all the patients. Results 3/35 (8.6%) patients were slightly positive for aPL: one for ACA IgG and two for ACA IgM but values were low (< 3X the cut off). No patients tested positive for ACA IgA neither for {beta}2GP1 isotypes. 3/35 (8.6%) patients were positive for PS/PT, one for IgG and two for IgM, but values were less than 2X the cut off. No patients showed simultaneous positivity for ACA and PS/ PT. Conclusions It is difficult to categorize the vascular events into a conventional disease: we did not find significant association with anti-phospholipid antibodies. It is most likely that several factors contribute to trigger the hypercoagulability status and the thromboembolism but, on the basis our results, CAPS is probably not involved into the pathogenesis of these phenomena.

Probable causes and risk factors for positive SARS-CoV-2 test in recovered patients: Evidence from Brunei Darussalam

We report findings of a national study in Brunei Darussalam indicating that one in five recovered patients subsequently test positive again for SARS-CoV-2 - this risk is nearly three times higher in older patients (age 53 and above) than younger ones (below age 53). Review of clinical and epidemiological records do not support reinfection or reactivation as likely causes of the 're-positive' observation. Instead, prolonged but intermittent viral shedding is the most probable explanation. We discuss the implications of these findings for infection control and clinical practice.

Interim Analysis of Pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Latin America and the Caribbean: Morbidity, Mortality and Molecular Testing Trends in the Region

Background: The relentless advance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic has resulted in a significant burden on countries, regardless of their socio-economic conditions. The virus has infected more than 2.5 million people worldwide, causing to date more than 150,000 deaths in over 210 countries. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the trends in cases, tests and deaths related to novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries. Methodology: Data were retrieved from the WHO-Coronavirus Disease (COVID-2019) situation reports and the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) databases from Johns Hopkins University. Descriptive statistics including death rates, cumulative mortality and incidence rates, as well as testing rates per population at risk were performed. A comparison analysis among countries with [≥]50 confirmed cases was performed from February 26th, 2020 to April 8th, 2020. Results: Brazil had the greatest number of cases and deaths in the region. Panama experienced a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases with Trinidad and Tobago, Bolivia and Honduras having the highest case fatality rates. Panama and Chile conducted more tests per million inhabitants and more tests per day per million inhabitants, followed by Uruguay and El Salvador. Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Ecuador and Brazil had the highest positive test rates. Conclusions: The COVID-19 disease pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has progressed rapidly in LAC countries. Some countries have been affected more severely than others, with some adopting similar disease control methods to help slow down the spread of the virus. With limited testing and other resources, social distancing is needed to help alleviate the strain on already stretched health systems.

Burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe covid-19 disease in Sweden

Objectives: Describe the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors of severe COVID-19 disease at national and county level in Sweden. Design: Cross sectional study Setting: Sweden Participants: 9,624,428 individuals living in Sweden on 31st December 2014 and alive on 1st January 2016 Main outcome measures: Burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 based on the guidelines from the World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which are age 70 years and older, cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe asthma, and diabetes. Prognostic factors were identified based on records for three years before 1st January 2016 from the Swedish National Inpatient and Outpatient Specialist Care Register, Prescribed Drug Register, and Cancer Register. Results: 22.1% of the study population had at least one prognostic factor for severe COVID-19 (2,131,319 individuals), and 1.6% had at least three factors (154,746 individuals). The prevalence of underlying medical conditions in the whole study population ranged from 0.8% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (78,516 individuals) to 7.4% with cardiovascular disease (708,090 individuals), and the county specific prevalence of at least one prognostic factor ranged from 19.2% in Stockholm (416,988 individuals) to 25.9% in Kalmar (60,005 individuals). Conclusions: The prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 disease will aid authorities in optimally planning healthcare resources during the ongoing pandemic. Results can also be applied to underlying assumptions of disease burden in modelling efforts to support COVID-19 planning. This information is crucial when deciding appropriate strategies to mitigate the pandemic and reduce both the direct mortality burden from the disease itself, and the indirect mortality burden from potentially overwhelmed health systems.

Novel coronavirus disease 2019 and perinatal outcomes

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Given the prevalence of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the lack of information on coronavirus and pregnancy, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of COVID-19 and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present review article, the search process was conducted on English and Persian scientific databases of PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Magiran, Irandoc, Iranmedx, and SID as well as the websites of international organizations of World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention using the main keywords of “Pregnancy,” “Perinatal outcomes,” “Coronavirus,” “COVID-19,” “MERS-CoV,” “MERS,” “SARS-CoV-2,” and “SARS-CoV-1” and their Persian-equivalent keywords from inception until March 16 2020. RESULTS: The findings of studies on mothers with COVID-19 were limited, and insufficient information is available on the adverse pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19. In cases of infection with other coronaviruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome during pregnancy, there have been reports on adverse pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm labor, low birth weight, and congenital malformations following high fever in the first trimester. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women may be more susceptible to viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19, due to immunological and physiological changes. Therefore, pregnant women should take routine preventive measures, such as washing their hands frequently and avoiding contact with infected people, to prevent infection.

On Global Power Differentials, Moral Realism, and the Rise of China: A Review Essay

This review essay examines the recent theoretical contribution of Yan Xuetong—China’s most cited political scientist—on ‘Moral Realism’ as it is presented in his latest magnum opus: ‘Leadership and the Rise of Great Powers.’ The essay evaluates the theoretical foundations of Yan’s treatise as well as its application on China’s domestic politics and foreign policy. Lastly the essay juxtaposes Yan’s theoretical take on moral realism, which draws extensively from the Chinese pre-Qin classics, to ideas deriving from Thucydides and the Greek classics. This comparative analysis between the western and eastern strategic logic attests to the existence of a universal cannon of strategy which puts a premium on ‘the first image’ of analysis—that of political leadership—and acknowledges the consequentiality of utilitarian morality in global politics within the structural restrictions of the international system.

Binding Ability Prediction between Spike Protein and Human ACE2 Reveals the Adaptive Strategy of SARS-CoV-2 in Humans

SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a novel coronavirus causing an outbreak of COVID-19 globally in the past six months. A relatively higher divergence on the spike protein of SASR-CoV-2 enables it to transmit across species efficiently. We particularly believe that the adaptive mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 might be essential to its high transmissibility among humans. Thus here we collected 2,142 high-quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 160 regions in over 50 countries and reconstructed their phylogeny, and also analyzed the interaction between the polymorphisms of spike protein and human ACE2 (hACE2). Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus in other hosts show SARS-CoV-2 is highly possible originated from Bat-CoV (RaTG13) found in horseshoe bat and a recombination event may occur on the spike protein of Pangolin-CoV to imbue it the ability to infect humans. Moreover, compared to the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, it is more conserved in the direct-binding sites of RBD and we noticed that spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 may under a consensus evolution to adapt to human hosts better. 3,860 amino acid mutations in spike protein RBD (T333-C525) of SARS-CoV-2 were simulated and their stability and affinity binding to hACE2 (S19-D615) were calculated. Our analysis indicates SARS-CoV-2 could infect humans from different populations with no preference, and a higher divergence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 at the early stage of this pandemic may be a good indicator that could show the pathway of SARS-CoV-2 transmitting from the natural reservoir to human beings.

Solubility-Weighted Index: fast and accurate prediction of protein solubility

Motivation Recombinant protein production is a widely used technique in the biotechnology and biomedical industries, yet only a quarter of target proteins are soluble and can therefore be purified. Results We have discovered that global structural flexibility, which can be modeled by normalised B-factors, accurately predicts the solubility of 12,216 recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. We have optimised B-factors, and derived a new set of values for solubility scoring that further improves prediction accuracy. We call this new predictor the ‘Solubility-Weighted Index’ (SWI). Importantly, SWI outperforms many existing protein solubility prediction tools. Furthermore, we have developed ‘SoDoPE’ (Soluble Domain for Protein Expression), a web interface that allows users to choose a protein region of interest for predicting and maximising both protein expression and solubility. Availability The SoDoPE web server and source code are freely available at https://tisigner.com/sodope and https://github.com/Gardner-BinfLab/TISIGNER-ReactJS, respectively. The code and data for reproducing our analysis can be found at https://github.com/Gardner-BinfLab/SoDoPE_paper2020.

tbiExtractor: A framework for extracting traumatic brain injury common data elements from radiology reports

Objective The manual extraction of valuable data from electronic medical records is cumbersome, error-prone, and inconsistent. By automating extraction in conjunction with standardized terminology, the quality and consistency of data utilized for research and clinical purposes would be substantially improved. Here, we set out to develop and validate a framework to extract pertinent clinical conditions for traumatic brain injury (TBI) from computed tomography (CT) reports. Materials and Methods We developed tbiExtractor, which extends pyConTextNLP, a regular expression algorithm using negation detection and contextual features, to create a framework for extracting TBI common data elements from radiology reports. The algorithm inputs radiology reports and outputs a structured summary containing 27 clinical findings with their respective annotations. Development and validation of the algorithm was completed using two physician annotators as the gold standard. Results tbiExtractor displayed high sensitivity (0.92-0.94) and specificity (0.99) when compared to the gold standard. The algorithm also demonstrated a high equivalence (94.6%) with the annotators. A majority of clinical findings (85%) had minimal errors (F1 Score ≥ 0.80). When compared to annotators, tbiExtractor extracted information in significantly less time (0.3 sec vs 1.7 min per report). Discussion and Conclusion tbiExtractor is a validated algorithm for extraction of TBI common data elements from radiology reports. This automation reduces the time spent to extract structured data and improves the consistency of data extracted. Lastly, tbiExtractor can be used to stratify subjects into groups based on visible damage by partitioning the annotations of the pertinent clinical conditions on a radiology report.

Robust and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 using PCR based methods

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as an international health emergency. Current diagnostic tests are based on the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method, the gold standard test that involves the amplification of viral RNA. However, the RT-qPCR assay has limitations in terms of sensitivity and quantification. In this study, we tested both qPCR and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect low amounts of viral RNA. The cycle threshold (CT) of viral RNA by RT-PCR significantly varied according to the sequence of primer and probe sets with in vitro transcript (IVT) RNA or viral RNA as templates, whereas the copy number of viral RNA by ddPCR was effectively quantified with IVT RNA, cultured viral RNA, and RNA from clinical samples. Furthermore, the clinical samples were assayed via both methods, and the sensitivity of the ddPCR was determined to be significantly higher than RT-qPCR. These findings suggest that ddPCR could be used as a highly sensitive and compatible diagnostic method for viral RNA detection.

Takotsubo Syndrome Associated with COVID-19

OBJECTIVE: The availability of public health information for optimised supportive care is critical during the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe the first case of COVID-19 complicated by Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report the clinical, laboratory and radiological findings of a patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: The nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 and x-ray images demonstrated pathognomonic pneumonia. The patient developed tachycardia and the echocardiogram confirmed the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Doctors should be aware of the need to thoroughly study this new infection in order to understand its underlying mechanisms and related complications. LEARNING POINTS: We report the first case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy associated with COVID-19. We discuss a rare presentation in the current pandemic. COVID-19 can be associated with cardiac complications, even after the onset of pneumonia, and so strict monitoring of these patients is essential.

Estimated Sp02/Fio2 ratio to predict mortality in patients with suspected COVID-19 in the Emergency Department: a prospective cohort study

Background This study examined whether the presence and severity of Type 1 Respiratory Failure (T1RF), as measured by the ratio of pulse oximetry to estimated fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/eFiO2 ratio), is a predictor of in-hospital mortality in patients presenting to the ED with suspected COVID19 infection. Methods We undertook a prospective observational cohort study of patients admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19 in a single ED in England. We used univariate and multiple logistic regression to examine whether the presence and severity of T1RF in the ED was independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Results 180 patients with suspected COVID19 infection met the inclusion criteria for this study, of which 39 (22%) died. Severity of T1RF was associated with increased mortality with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals of 1.58 (0.49 to 5.14), 3.60 (1.23 to 10.6) and 18.5 (5.65 to 60.8) for mild, moderate and severe T1RF, respectively. After adjusting for age, gender, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, neutrophil-lymphocyte ration (NLR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the association remained, with ORs of 0.63 (0.13 to 3.03), 3.95 (0.94 to 16.6) and 45.8 (7.25 to 290). The results were consistent across a number of sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Severity of T1RF in the ED is an important prognostic factor of mortality in patients admitted with suspected COVID19 infection. Current prediction models frequently do not include this factor and should be applied with caution. Further large scale research on predictors of mortality in COVID19 infection should include SpO2/eFiO2 ratios or a similar measure of respiratory dysfunction.

Alternative metrics for assessing the social impact of tourism research

Alternative metrics are increasingly used to measure the social impact of research. This article seeks to analyze the social impact of research in the field of tourism. For this purpose, we will determine the extent to which the articles in this field reach society by examining the scores they achieve on social media and studying the correlation between scientific impact and social impact. Altmetric information will be used for data extraction and analysis. The results show a low correlation between citations and the Altmetric Attention Score (AAS), as well as a presence that is not captured by most publications in the field of study. Interestingly, publications with higher AASs are concentrated in the same journals. The article concludes by determining that alternative metrics can be used to complement academic impact but cannot be a substitute for it. Further progress is needed in the development of a framework that unifies both impacts.

Whiteness is not contained

The emergence of COVID-19, or the Coronavirus, has sparked a wave of anti-Asian attacks around the world. The cultural logic that does not distinguish among Asian cultural and ethnic groups, as well as the need to find scapegoats, reignites the trope of the “Yellow Peril.” The Yellow Peril is deeply entwined with whiteness and this forum calls for more interrogation of the ways that whiteness reinscribes its position-locally and globally.

Systemic inflammation suppresses lymphoid tissue remodeling and B cell immunity during concomitant local infection

Concurrent infection with multiple pathogens occurs frequently in individuals and can result in exacerbated infections and altered immunity. However, the impact of such coinfections on immune responses remains poorly understood. Here we reveal that systemic infection results in an inflammation-induced suppression of local immunity. During localized infection or vaccination in barrier tissues including the skin or respiratory tract, concurrent systemic infection induced a type I interferon-dependent lymphopenia that impairs lymphocyte recruitment to the draining lymph node (dLN). This leads to suppressed lymphoid stromal cell expansion and dLN remodeling and impaired induction of B cell responses and antibody production. Our data suggest that contemporaneous systemic inflammation constrains the induction of regional immunity.

Antigenic evolution on global scale reveals potential natural selection of SARS-CoV-2 by pre-existing cross-reactive T cell immunity

The mutation pattern of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is constantly changing with the places of transmission, but the reason remains to be revealed. Here, we presented the study that comprehensively analyzed the potential selective pressure of immune system restriction, which can drive mutations in circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates. The results showed that the most common mutation sites of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were located on the non-structural protein ORF1ab and the structural protein Spike. Further analysis revealed mutations in cross-reactive epitopes between SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronavirus may help SARS-CoV-2 to escape cellular immunity under the long-term and large-scale community transmission. Meanwhile, the mutations on Spike protein may enhance the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells and escape the recognition of B-cell immunity. This study will increase the understanding of the evolutionary direction and warn about the potential immune escape ability of SARS-CoV-2, which may provide important guidance for the potential vaccine design.

A simple criterion to design optimal nonpharmaceutical interventions for epidemic outbreaks

To mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, much emphasis exists on implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions to keep the reproduction number below one. But using that objective ignores that some of these interventions, like bans of public events or lockdowns, must be transitory and as short as possible because of their significative economic and societal costs. Here we derive a simple and mathematically rigorous criterion for designing optimal transitory non-pharmaceutical interventions. We find that reducing the reproduction number below one is sufficient but not necessary. Instead, our criterion prescribes the required reduction in the reproduction number according to the maximum health services' capacity. To explore the implications of our theoretical results, we study the non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented in 16 cities during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we estimate the minimal reduction of the contact rate in each city that is necessary to control the epidemic optimally. We also compare the optimal start of the intervention with the start of the actual interventions applied in each city. Our results contribute to establishing a rigorous methodology to guide the design of non- pharmaceutical intervention policies.

Searching the Sigmoid-type trend in Lock Down period covid19 data of India and its different states

We have worked on imported covid19 cases of India, detected after declaration of lock down. They are marked as hidden travelers, who are detected later during 1-2 weeks period of lock down. We have investigated the impact of those travelers on selective 15 states, having large number cases. Among them 5 states have faced a noticeable effect on their data profile, although its overall effect in country level is quite negligible. Searching the Sigmoid trends of all 15 states, we have identified 3 categories depending upon latest data of new case with respect to the peak value of Sigmoid functions. Based on our optimistic predicted curves, ongoing lock down period might be enough for getting marginal values of new cases for KL, HR, JK, TN and AP but the reamining of 15 states might need a third phase of lock down or alternative preventive measures.

In Vitro Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Infection by Bovine Lactoferrin

Since its emergence in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been posing a serious threat to public health worldwide as the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Now distributed in a pandemic pattern, this disease still lacks an effective drug treatment with low toxicity, leading pharmaceutical companies and research labs to work against time to find a candidate molecule to efficiently treat the affected patients. Due to the well-known broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the lactoferrin protein, we sought to verify whether its bovine form (bLf) would also be effective in vitro against SARS-CoV-2. Using an antiviral assay based on quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), we found that bLf reduced progeny virus yield by up to ∼84,6% in African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero E6) and ∼68,6% in adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549) at 1 mg/mL, a concentration previously shown to have low cytotoxicity. Therefore, our preliminary data suggest that bLf has the potential to constitute a biochemical approach to fight the new coronavirus pandemic.

Study of Epidemiological Characteristics and In-silico Analysis of the Effect of Interventions in the SARS-CoV-2 Epidemic in India

After SARS-CoV-2 set foot in India, the Government took a number of steps to limit the spread of the disease in the country. This study involves assessing how the disease affected the population in the initial days of the epidemic. Data was collected from government-controlled and crowdsourced websites and analysed. Studying age and sex parameters of 413 Indian COVID-19 patients, the median age of the affected individuals was found to be 36 years (IQR, 25-54) with 20-39 years males being the most affected group. The number of affected males (66.34%) was more than that of the females (33.66%). Using Susceptible-Infected- Removed (SIR) model, the range of contact rate (β) of India was calculated and the role of public health interventions was assessed. If current contact rate continues, India may have 5583 to 13785 active cases at the end of 21 days lockdown.

Identification and Analysis of Shared Risk Factors in Sepsis and High Mortality Risk COVID-19 Patients

BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel coronavirus strain disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease is highly transmissible and severe disease including viral sepsis has been reported in up to 16% of hospitalized cases. The admission characteristics associated with increased odds of hospital mortality among confirmed cases of COVID-19 include severe hypoxia, low platelet count, elevated bilirubin, hypoalbuminemia and reduced glomerular filtration rate. These symptoms correlate highly with severe sepsis cases. The diseases also share similar co-morbidity risks including dementia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, hypertension and chronic renal failure. Sepsis has been observed in up to 59% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It is highly desirable to identify risk factors and novel therapy/drug repurposing avenues for late-stage severe COVID-19 patients. This would enable better protection of at-risk populations and clinical stratification of COVID-19 patients according to their risk for developing life threatening disease. METHODS As there is currently insufficient data available for confirmed COVID-19 patients correlating their genomic profile, disease severity and outcome, co-morbidities and treatments as well as epidemiological risk factors (such as ethnicity, blood group, smoking, BMI etc.), a direct study of the impact of host genomics on disease severity and outcomes is not yet possible. We therefore ran a study on the UK Biobank sepsis cohort as a surrogate to identify sepsis associated signatures and genes, and correlated these with COVID-19 patients. Sepsis is itself a life-threatening inflammatory health condition with a mortality rate of approximately 20%. Like the initial studies for COVID-19 patients, standard genome wide association studies (GWAS) have previously failed to identify more than a handful of genetic variants that predispose individuals to developing sepsis. RESULTS We used a combinatorial association approach to analyze a sepsis population derived from UK Biobank. We identified 70 sepsis risk-associated genes, which provide insights into the disease mechanisms underlying sepsis pathogenesis. Many of these targets can be grouped by common mechanisms of action such as endothelial cell dysfunction, PI3K/mTOR pathway signaling, immune response regulation, aberrant GABA and neurogenic signaling. CONCLUSION This study has identified 70 sepsis related genes, many of them for the first time, that can reasonably be considered to be potentially relevant to severe COVID-19 patients. We have further identified 59 drug repurposing candidates for 13 of these targets that can be used for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to increase the survival rate of patients who develop sepsis and potentially severe COVID-19.

Acute kidney injury at early stage as a negative prognostic indicator of patients with COVID-19: a hospital-based retrospective analysis

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has been pandemic all over the world. This study described acute kidney injury (AKI) at early stage of COVID-19 and its clinical significance. Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients with were recruited and clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. Patient's prognosis was tracked and risk factors of AKI was analyzed. Of 355 COVID-19 patients, common, severe and critical ill cases accounted for 63.1%, 16.9% and 20.0%, respectively. On admission, 56 (15.8%) patients were with AKI. Although AKI was more common in critical ill patients with COVID-19, there was no significant association between oxygenation index and renal functional indices among COVID-19 patients with AKI. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and comorbidity with diabetes were three important independent risk factors predicting AKI among COVID-19 patients. Among 56 COVID-19 patients with AKI, 33.9% were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. Fatality rate was obviously higher among COVID-+19 patients with AKI than those without AKI (RR=7.08, P<0.001). In conclusion, male elderly COVID-19 patients with diabetes are more susceptible to AKI. AKI at early stage may be a negative prognostic indicator for COVID-19.

Age-dependent progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters

In late 2019, an outbreak of a severe respiratory disease caused by an emerging coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, resulted in high morbidity and mortality in infected humans1. Complete understanding of COVID-19, the multi-faceted disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, requires suitable small animal models, as does the development and evaluation of vaccines and antivirals2. Because age-dependent differences of COVID-19 were identified in humans3, we compared the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in young and aged Syrian hamsters. We show that virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract was independent of the age of the animals. However, older hamsters exhibited more pronounced and consistent weight loss. In situ hybridization in the lungs identified viral RNA in bronchial epithelium, alveolar epithelial cells type I and II, and macrophages. Histopathology revealed clear age-dependent differences, with young hamsters launching earlier and stronger immune cell influx than aged hamsters. The latter developed conspicuous alveolar and perivascular edema, indicating vascular leakage. In contrast, we observed rapid lung recovery at day 14 after infection only in young hamsters. We propose that comparative assessment in young versus aged hamsters of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and treatments may yield valuable information as this small-animal model appears to mirror age-dependent differences in human patients.

Hypoferremia predicts hospitalization and oxygen demand in COVID-19 patients

Background: Iron metabolism might play a crucial role in cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 patients. Therefore we assessed iron metabolism markers in COVID-19 patients for their ability to predict disease severity. Methods: COVID-19 patients referred to the Heidelberg University Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into outpatients (cohort A, n=204), inpatients (cohort B, n=81), and outpatients later admitted to hospital because of health deterioration (cohort C, n=23). Results: Iron metabolism parameters were severely altered in patients of cohort B and C compared to cohort A. In multivariate regression analysis including age, gender, CRP and iron-related parameters only serum iron and ferritin were significantly associated with hospitalization. ROC analysis revealed an AUC for serum iron of 0.894 and an iron concentration <6micromol/l as the best cutoff-point predicting hospitalization with a sensitivity of 94.7% and a specificity of 67.9%. When stratifying inpatients in a low- and high oxygen demand group serum iron levels differed significantly between these two groups and showed a high negative correlation with the inflammatory parameters IL-6, procalcitonin, and CRP. Unexpectedly, serum iron levels poorly correlate with hepcidin. Conclusion: We conclude that measurement of serum iron can help predicting the severity of COVID-19. The differences in serum iron availability observed between the low and high oxygen demand group suggest that disturbed iron metabolism likely plays a causal role in the pathophysiology leading to lung injury.

Indoor transmission of SARS-CoV-2

Background: By early April 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had infected nearly one million people and had spread to nearly all countries worldwide. It is essential to understand where and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted. Methods: Case reports were extracted from the local Municipal Health Commissions of 320 prefectural cities (municipalities) in China, not including Hubei province, between 4 January and 11 February 2020. We identified all outbreaks involving three or more cases and reviewed the major characteristics of the enclosed spaces in which the outbreaks were reported and associated indoor environmental issues. Results: Three hundred and eighteen outbreaks with three or more cases were identified, involving 1245 confirmed cases in 120 prefectural cities. We divided the venues in which the outbreaks occurred into six categories: homes, transport, food, entertainment, shopping, and miscellaneous. Among the identified outbreaks, 53.8% involved three cases, 26.4% involved four cases, and only 1.6% involved ten or more cases. Home outbreaks were the dominant category (254 of 318 outbreaks; 79.9%), followed by transport (108; 34.0%; note that many outbreaks involved more than one venue category). Most home outbreaks involved three to five cases. We identified only a single outbreak in an outdoor environment, which involved two cases. Conclusions: All identified outbreaks of three or more cases occurred in an indoor environment, which confirms that sharing indoor space is a major SARS-CoV-2 infection risk.

The First Month Spread of COVID-19 in Madagascar

Using the officially published data and aware of the unclear source and inaccurate number of samples, we present a first and (for the moment) unique attempt to study the spread of the pandemic COVID-19 in Madagascar. The approach has been tested by predicting the number of contaminated persons until 20 days after fitting the inputs data collected within 15 days using standard least {chi}2-fit method. Encouraged by this first test, we add the new data collected within 30 days and give prevision until 33 days. The present data show an approximate linear increase of about (4-5) infected persons per day while the analysis signals an eventual near future stronger growth. These results may also be interpreted as the lowest values of the real cases due to the insufficient number of samples (about 2200 for 20 millions of population). A comparison with some other approaches is done. Some social, economical and political impacts of COVID-19 and confinement for Madagascar and Worldwide are shortly discussed.

Co-movement of COVID-19 and Bitcoin: Evidence from wavelet coherence analysis

We apply wavelet methods to daily data of COVID-19 world deaths and daily Bitcoin prices from 31th December 2019 to 29th April 2020. We find, especially for the period post April 5, that levels of COVID-19 caused a rise in Bitcoin prices. We contribute to the fast-growing body of work on the financial impacts of COVID-19, as well as to ongoing consideration of whether Bitcoin is a safe haven investment. Our results should be of great interest to both scholars and policy makers, as well as investment professionals interested in the financial implications of both COVID-19 and cryptocurrencies.

Developing optimal policies to fight pandemics and covid-19 combat in the United States

The world has faced many outbreaks and pandemics with hundreds of millions of deaths throughout its history. Those epidemics are global health concerns and as well as serious economic issues. There is certain need to allocate scarce sources efficiently to fight such epidemics in both personal and global dimensions. Here we develop and propose two optimization models to maximize the total protection from any epidemic, pandemic or bioterror attacks; the first one is personal protection model or protocol and the other one is mass protection model that is inspired by the well-known weapon-target assignment problem of operations research. These efforts are optimal allocation of scarce medical and economic resources to save millions of lives- gift of life. We implement our general mathematical programming models with real-world data to fight the coronavirus pandemic for a person and the United States. Our personal protection protocol provides 99.99% protection from COVID-19 for an American through personal strategies when the mass protection model supplies 96.961% protection on average from coronavirus pandemic for the United States through countrywide policies. The mass protection model which recommends general policy frame for health care policy makers could be applied for any epidemic at any level from county to city, to state and country as well as in global scale. The mathematical relation between the personal protection protocol and the mass protection model also highlights the fact of unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno (one for all, all for one) for fighting epidemics- particularly the moving enemy, novel coronavirus which is double invisible due to its viral nature and the availability of the high level of asymptomatic cases. Recognize the enemy, as protecting yourself means protecting people, love life, follow the rules and stay at home. That is the greatest ever social impact.

Cancer care in the time of COVID-19—a perspective from Pakistan

Across much of the world, cancer care has been sidelined to a variable degree by the global effort against the coronavirus pandemic. This paper discusses the impact of coronavirus infection on cancer diagnosis and treatment in two leading cancer centres in Pakistan. It also describes the effect that preparations for the expected surge in cases in Pakistan over the next few weeks have had on cancer care. There is an urgent need to evaluate the effect of delays in diagnosis and treatment on cancer stage and treatment, and to decide how to minimise these during likely future cycles of lockdown over the coming months and years.

Gastrointestinal features of the “new coronavirus” infection/ Manifestaciones gastrointestinales de la infección por el “nuevo coronavirus”

The World´s Heath Organization (WHO) declared the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 a pandemic in March 11 2020. The first data about the disease clinical features were reported from Wuhan China the epicenter of the outbreak; aside from the respiratory involvement, gastrointestinal manifestations have been described. Even though the exact mechanism for the new coronavirus tropism for the gastrointestinal tract is not well understood, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor seems to play an important role as the entry site for the virus, since it is widespread located throughout the enteric mucosa. Fecal oral transmission is a possible contagion route, regardless of the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms, the virus has been isolated from feces even 7-12 days after a negative pharyngeal swab. COVID’s-19 gastrointestinal involvement is not an infrequent event, data reports patients who present with these symptoms have worst prognosis. Knowing the possible gastrointestinal manifestations might rise our clinical suspicion in order to establish earlier and timely diagnosis.

Mental health issues and psychological crisis interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic and earthquakes in Croatia/ Mentalno zdravlje i psihološke krizne intervencije tijekom COVID-19 pandemije i potresa u Hrvatskoj

The newly discovered coronavirus, now called SARS-CoV-2, was first detected in Wuhan, China as a cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome, disease called COVID-19. From the beginning of 2020 it rapidly spread, affecting the whole world, but with a major impact in Europe and North America. At the moment of writing, there are more than 2 million confirmed cases with more than 125.000 confirmed deaths related to COVID-19 globally. In Croatia, there are currently 1.741 confirmed cases with 34 deaths related to the virus. The COVID-19 rapid spread and magnitude of pandemic unleashed panic among people which warrants public health officials to also address the epidemic of fear. Research on the psychological reactions to previous epidemics and pandemics suggests that various psychological factors may play a role in coronaphobia. Nov-elty and uncertainty what the unknown brings is likely the cause of COVID-19 fear. With the sharp increase in number of affected persons by pandemic, both infected or suspected cases in isolation, fear and anxiety grew in general population, which warranted a significant increase in need for psychiatric support for both patients and medical staff. After initial stabilization of the situation and a prompt response to increased needs for mental support, during this time of pandemic, self-isolations and imposed social distancing, the strongest earthquake this city has experienced in the last 140 years hit Croatian capital Zagreb. During these trying times, maintaining good mental health of both medical personnel as well as the general population is crucial for both health and mental damage control. In Croatia, crisis interventions aimed for those most exposed to mental impact of pandemic and natural disasters is limited.

Miniaturization for Point-of-Care Analysis: Platform Technology for Almost Every Biomedical Assay

Platform technologies for the changing need of diagnostics are one of the main challenges in medical device technology. From one point-of-view the demand for new and more versatile diagnostic is increasing due to a deeper knowledge of biomarkers and their combination with diseases. From another point-of-view a decentralization of diagnostics will occur since decisions can be made faster resulting in higher success of therapy. Hence, new types of technologies have to be established which enables a multiparameter analysis at the point-of-care. Within this review-like article a system called Fraunhofer ivD-platform is introduced. It consists of a credit-card sized cartridge with integrated reagents, sensors and pumps and a read-out/processing unit. Within the cartridge the assay runs fully automated within 15-20 minutes. Due to the open design of the platform different analyses such as antibody, serological or DNA-assays can be performed. Specific examples of these three different assay types are given to show the broad applicability of the system.

Public health department training of emergency medical technicians for bioterrorism and public health emergencies: results of a national assessment.

HYPOTHESIS The public health system has a specialized body of knowledge and expertise in bioterrorism and public health emergency management that can assist in the development and delivery of continuing medical education programs to meet the needs of emergency medical service providers. METHODS A nationally representative sample of the basic and paramedic emergency medical service providers in the United States was surveyed to assess whether they had received training in weapons of mass destruction, bioterrorism, chemical terrorism, radiological terrorism, and/or public health emergencies, and how the training was provided. RESULTS Local health departments provided little in the way of training in biologic, chemical, or radiological terrorism to responders (7.4%-14.9%). State health departments provided even less training (6.3%-17.3%) on all topics to emergency medical services providers. Training that was provided by the health department in bioterrorism and public health emergency response was associated with responder comfort in responding to a bioterrorism event (OR = 2.74, 95% CI = 2.68, 2.81). CONCLUSIONS Local and state public health agencies should work with the emergency medical services systems to develop and deliver training with an all-hazards approach to disasters and other public health emergencies.

[Clinical pathology and pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome].

BACKGROUND To explore the pathological features and pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to provide evidence for the clinical treatment and prevention of SARS. METHODS Pathological features of 2 cases of full autopsy and 4 cases of needle biopsy tissue samples from the patients who died from SARS were studied by light and electron microscopy. The distribution and quantity of lymphocyte subpopulations in the lungs and immune organs from SARS patients were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The location and semi-quantitative analysis of SARS coronavirus in the tissue specimens were studied by electron microscopy, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS In total of 6 cases, diffuse alveolar damage and alveolar cell proliferation were common. The major pathological changes of 2 autopsy cases of SARS in lung tissues were acute pulmonary interstitial and alveolar exudative inflammation, and 2 autopsy and one biopsy lung tissues showed alveolar hyaline membrane formation. Terminal bronchiolar and alveolar desquamation of lung tissues in one autopsy and 2 biopsy cases were noted. Among 6 cases, 2 biopsy cases presented early pulmonary fibrosis and alveolar organization. Meanwhile, the immune organs, including lymph nodes and spleens from 2 autopsy cases of SARS whose disease courses were less than 12 days showed extensive hemorrhagic necrosis, reactive macrophage/histocyte proliferation, with relative depression of mononuclear and granulocytic clones in the bone marrows. However, spleen and bone marrow biopsy tissue samples from 4 dead SARS cases whose clinical course lasted from 21 to 40 days presented repairing changes. SARS coronaviruses were mainly identified in type I and II alveolar epithelia, macrophages, and endothelia; meanwhile, some renal tubular epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, mucosal and crypt epithelial cells of gastrointestinal tracts, parenchymal cells in adrenal glands, lymphocytes, testicular epithelial cells and Leydig's cells were also detected by electron microscopy combined with in situ hybridization. The semi-quantitative analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations revealed that the proportion of CD8+ T lymphocytes were about 80% of the total infiltrative inflammatory cells in the pulmonary interstitium, with a few CD4+ lymphocytes CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ or CD20+ lymphocyte subpopulations were obviously decreased and there was imbalance in number and proportion, while CD57+, CD68+, S-100+ and HLA-DR+ cells were relatively increased in lymph nodes and spleens. CONCLUSIONS Histologically, the pulmonary changes could be divided into acute inflammatory exudative, terminal bronchiolar and alveolar desquamative and proliferative repair stages or types during the pathological process of SARS. SARS coronavirus was found in multi-target cells in vivo, which means that SARS coronavirus might cause multi-organ damages which were predominant in lungs. There were varying degrees of decrease and imbalance in number and proportion of lymphocyte subpopulations in the immune organs of the patients with SARS. However, these changes may be reversible. It was found that cellular immune responses were predominant in the lungs of SARS cases, which might play an important role in getting rid of coronaviruses in infected cells and inducing immune mediated injury.

Comparative analysis of innate immune responses following infection of newborn calves with bovine rotavirus and bovine coronavirus.

Bovine rotavirus (BRV) and bovine coronavirus (BCV) are important causes of diarrhoea and death in newborn calves. Although these viruses belong to distinct viral classes, they both infect intestinal epithelial cells and induce similar clinical symptoms. Rotavirus usually causes an acute infection, but coronavirus infection can persist and reoccur in adults. Differences in viral structure and clinical outcome prompted us to postulate that innate mucosal immune responses would be markedly different following rotavirus and coronavirus infections. To address this hypothesis, gene expression following BRV and BCV infection was analysed in surgically prepared intestinal loops from 1-day-old colostrum-deprived calves. Gene expression was profiled at 18 h post-infection using bovine cDNA microarrays; the majority of differentially expressed significant genes were associated with the cell cycle and innate immune responses. A select group of these genes was validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression of genes associated with interferons (IFNs), cytokines and Toll-like receptors, which were not present on the microarray, was analysed further by qRT-PCR. Strong activation of TLR3, IL-6 and p65 was observed in BRV-infected host tissues, but not in tissues infected with BCV. Both viruses also downregulated IFN- and pro-inflammatory cytokine-associated pathways. In vitro studies confirmed that IFN inhibited viral replication. All of these results together suggested either that very early events of host responses at 18 h post-infection were being observed, or that both viruses have unique effective strategies to evade host immune responses.

[Etiology of infectious diseases in pregnant women with symptoms of fever and lung syndrome].

31 samples of blood serum of pregnant women with acute respiratory virus infection and pneumonia symptoms who had been administered into hospital were analyzed. Antibacterial and antifungal treatment was ineffective. Autumn-winter-spring seasonality was detected. In connection with above-mentioned, an attempt was made to find out the etiology of a disease using viroloy methods. Primers of hantaviruses, Crimea-and-Congo hemorrhage fever, coronaviruses, SARS, Leptospirosis and virus hepatitis. Genome of B hepatitis virus was discovered in 3 samples, C--in one sample, G--in four samples. The test for other primers was negative. It was shown that in case of serious clinical course only abortion can save mother's life. It is necessary to find out aetiology of the disease, primers and other pathogenic organisms of virus infections.

A multicenter study of grepafloxacin and clarithromycin in the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

STUDY OBJECTIVES To compare the efficacies of 10-day regimens of grepafloxacin (GFX) (Raxar or Vaxar; Glaxo Wellcome; Greenford, UK), 600 qd, and clarithromycin (CLA) (Klacid, Biaxin, or Klaracid; Abbott Laboratories; Chicago, IL), 500 mg bid, in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), on the basis of clinical response, including radiographic evidence, and bacteriologic efficacy. DESIGN Phase IIIb, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, prospective, parallel-group, comparative study conducted at 58 centers in 11 countries. PATIENTS AND SETTING Adult patients with signs and symptoms of CAP that was confirmed by radiographic evidence and who did not require parenteral therapy were included in the study. ASSESSMENTS Patients were assessed before treatment, during treatment, after treatment, and at follow-up (28 to 35 days after treatment completion). Clinical response was evaluated. Blood and sputum samples were cultured for bacterial pathogens, and serology testing was performed to detect atypical pneumonia. RESULTS A total of 504 patients were enrolled into the trial: 251 were randomly assigned to receive GFX and 253 to receive CLA. In patients able to be clinically evaluated, clinical success rates at follow-up were 147 of 163 patients (90%) in the GFX group and 148 of 167 patients (89%) in the CLA group (95% confidence interval, -6% to 9%). Pretreatment pathogens were confirmed in 131 of 504 patients (26%), either by culture or serology testing, the primary pathogens being Streptococcus pneumoniae (22%), Haemophilus influenzae (17%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (25%), and Chlamydia pneumoniae (11%). For patients able to be evaluated who had typical pathogens, bacteriologic success was achieved in 92% of the patients in each treatment group. For patients able to be evaluated who had atypical pathogens, 18 of 18 patients (100%) in the GFX and 23 of 26 patients (88%) in the CLA group had a successful clinical outcome. There were similar rates of adverse events in each group, resulting in </= 7% withdrawal from treatment; gastrointestinal events were the most common. CONCLUSIONS GFX, 600 mg qd, was equivalent to CLA, 500 mg bid, in treating adult patients with CAP. Both treatments were well tolerated.

Differential sensitivities of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus spike polypeptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein ELISA for serodiagnosis of SARS coronavirus pneumonia.

The use of recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid protein (N) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based antibody and antigen tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV infections have been widely reported. However, no recombinant SARS-CoV spike protein (S)-based ELISA is currently available. In this article, we describe the problems and solutions of setting up the recombinant SARS-CoV S-based ELISA for antibody detection. The SARS-CoV S-based immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG ELISAs were evaluated and compared with the corresponding N-based ELISA for serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV pneumonia, using sera from 148 healthy blood donors who donated blood 3 years ago as controls and 95 SARS-CoV pneumonia patients in Hong Kong. Results obtained by the recombinant S (rS)-based IgG ELISA using the regenerated S prepared by dialysis with decreasing concentrations of urea or direct addition of different coating buffers, followed by addition of different regeneration buffer, identified 4 M urea and 1 M sarcosine for plate coating and no regeneration buffer as the most optimal conditions for antibody detection. The specificities of the S-based ELISA for IgG and IgM detection were 98.6% and 93.9%, with corresponding sensitivities of 58.9% and 74.7%, respectively. The sensitivity of the rN IgG ELISA (94.7%) is significantly higher than that of the rS IgG ELISA (P < 0.001), whereas the sensitivity of the rS IgM ELISA is significantly higher than that of the rN IgM ELISA (55.2%) (P < 0.01). An ELISA for detection of IgM against S and N could be more sensitive than one that detects IgM against N alone for serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV pneumonia.

Impact of ibuprofen administration on renal drug clearance in the first weeks of life.

The administration of ibuprofen or any other nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor drug in early neonatal life is associated with a reduction of glomerular filtration, which reduces the elimination of drugs dependent on renal function for clearance. However, the relationship between COX inhibitor drug indication (prophylactic or therapeutic) and the magnitude of this effect remains unclear. Observations collected in two population pharmacokinetic studies, in preterm neonates, investigating amikacin and vancomycin were used to estimate: i) the impact of ibuprofen administration on the clearance of these drugs; and ii) the difference between prophylactic and therapeutic administration of ibuprofen on this clearance. Prophylactic administration of ibuprofen to preterm neonates on the first day of life to enhance closure of an asymptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) reduced amikacin clearance by 21% while coadministration of ibuprofen to induce closure of a symptomatic PDA resulted in an 18% reduction in vancomycin clearance in the first month of postnatal life. A significant and clinically relevant reduction in drug clearance is observed when ibuprofen is coadministered independent of indication, postmenstrual or postnatal age. Population modeling with covariate analyses can provide us with the tools to further disentangle the impact of nonselective COX-inhibitors on renal drug clearance.

Assessment of factors associated with prominent changes in blood pressure during an early mobilization protocol for patients with acute ischemic stroke after mechanical thrombectomy.

OBJECTIVE To assess factors associated with changes in blood pressure during early mobilization protocol for patients with acute ischemic stroke who were treated with mechanical thrombectomy. DESIGN Retrospective observational study. METHOD We analyzed patients with acute ischemic stroke who were treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT group, n=60) and patients who received conservative medical management (control group, n=60) matched by age and National Institute Health of Stroke Score at admission from April 2009 to July 2014. The proportion of patients with prominent blood pressure change during an early mobilization protocol was compared between the MT group and control group. Factors associated with prominent blood pressure change were also analyzed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULT The deviation in blood pressure response was much more significant in the MT than control group (13.3 vs. 1.7%, p<0.016). Logistic regression analysis showed the interval from admission to being able to sit in a wheelchair associated with prominent changes in blood pressure (odds ratio, 1.604; 95% confidence interval, 1.196-2.150; p<0.002). CONCLUSION Our results showed that prominent changes in blood pressure during an early mobilization protocol can occur easily in patients with acute ischemic stroke after mechanical thrombectomy.

Site directed mutagenesis of the murine coronavirus spike protein. Effects on fusion.

Mutations were introduced in the transmembrane region of the spike protein of the murine coronavirus A59. The maturation of these mutant S proteins was not affected, they were all expressed at the cell surface, and became acylated, however some mutant S proteins did not induce cell-to-cell fusion. An I-->K change in the middle of the predicted transmembrane (TM) anchor and mutation of the first three cysteine residues of the TM domain resulted in a fusion-negative phenotype. We propose a model by which these data can be explained.

Development and Validation of a Scoring System for Predicting Periprocedural Complications During Percutaneous Coronary Interventions of Chronic Total Occlusions: The Prospective Global Registry for the Study of Chronic Total Occlusion Intervention (PROGRESS CTO) Complications Score.

BACKGROUND High success rates are achievable for chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using the hybrid approach, but periprocedural complications remain of concern. Although scores estimating success and efficiency in CTO PCI have been developed, there is currently no available score for estimation of the risk for periprocedural complications. We sought to develop a scoring tool for prediction of periprocedural complications during CTO PCI. METHODS AND RESULTS We analyzed data from 1569 CTO PCIs in the Prospective Global Registry for the Study of Chronic Total Occlusion Intervention (PROGRESS CTO) using a derivation and validation sampling ratio of 2:1. Variables independently associated with periprocedural complications in multivariable analysis in the derivation set were assigned points based on their respective odds ratios. Forty-four (2.8%) patients experienced complications. Three factors were independent predictors of complications and were included in the score: patient age >65 years, +3 points (odds ratio, OR=4.85, CI 1.82-16.77); lesion length ≥23 mm, +2 points (OR=3.22, CI 1.08-13.89); and use of the retrograde approach +1 point (OR=2.41, CI 1.04-6.05). The resulting score showed good calibration and discriminatory capacity in the derivation (Hosmer-Lemeshow χ2 6.271, P=0.281, receiver-operating characteristic [ROC] area=0.758) and validation (Hosmer-Lemeshow χ2 4.551, P=0.473, ROC area=0.793) sets. Score values of 0 to 2, 3 to 4, and ≥5 were defined as low, intermediate, and high risk of complications (derivation cohort 0.4%, 1.8%, 6.5%, P<0.001; validation cohort 0.0%, 2.5%, 6.8%, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The PROGRESS CTO complication score is a useful tool for prediction of periprocedural complications in CTO PCI. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT02061436.

Mouse hepatitis virus replicase proteins associate with two distinct populations of intracellular membranes.

The coronavirus replicase gene (gene 1) is translated into two co-amino-terminal polyproteins that are proteolytically processed to yield more than 15 mature proteins. Several gene 1 proteins have been shown to localize at sites of viral RNA synthesis in the infected cell cytoplasm, notably on late endosomes at early times of infection. However, both immunofluorescence and electron microscopic studies have also detected gene 1 proteins at sites distinct from the putative sites of viral RNA synthesis or virus assembly. In this study, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected cells were fractionated and analyzed to determine if gene 1 proteins segregated to more than one membrane population. Following differential centrifugation of lysates of MHV-infected DBT cells, gene 1 proteins as well as the structural N and M proteins were detected almost exclusively in a high-speed small membrane pellet. Following fractionation of the small membrane pellet on an iodixanol density gradient, the gene 1 proteins p28 and helicase cofractionated with dense membranes (1.12 to 1.13 g/ml) that also contained peak concentrations of N. In contrast, p65 and p1a-22 were detected in a distinct population of less dense membranes (1.05 to 1.09 g/ml). Viral RNA was detected in membrane fractions containing helicase, p28, and N but not in the fractions containing p65 and p1a-22. LAMP-1, a marker for late endosomes and lysosomes, was detected in both membrane populations. These results demonstrate that multiple gene 1 proteins segregate into two biochemically distinct but tightly associated membrane populations and that only one of these populations appears to be a site for viral RNA synthesis. The results further suggest that p28 is a component of the viral replication complex whereas the gene 1 proteins p1a-22 and p65 may serve roles during infection that are distinct from viral RNA transcription or replication.

Characterization of a Borna disease virus glycoprotein, gp18.

Borna disease virus is a nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus that causes neurologic disease in a wide variety of animal hosts. Here we describe identification and characterization of the first glycoprotein in this viral system. The 18-kDa glycoprotein, gp18, has been purified from infected rat brain. Isolation and microsequencing of this protein allowed identification of a 16.2-kDa open reading frame in the viral antigenome. Lectin binding and endoglycosidase sensitivity assays indicate that gp18 is an unusual N-linked glycoprotein.

Etiology of diarrhea in measles.

Thirty-six measles cases with diarrhea were studied with two age and sex matched control groups, measles without diarrhea (75 cases) and acute diarrhea (70 cases). Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 5 out of 36 (13.9%) in measles with diarrhea but rotavirus, coronavirus and parasites were not detected in any case. The bacterial and viral etiology of measles with diarrhea were statistically significant different from the acute diarrhea group (p less than 0.005) and p less than 0.01 respectively) but not from the measles without diarrhea group (p greater than 0.05). 83.3 per cent of cases had diarrhea during 4 days before and after the appearance of rash. Watery diarrhea was frequently observed in this study (63.9%). Although measles virus was not identified in stools, data from this study suggested that measles may be the viral agent causing diarrhea. Watery stools are often observed and the presence of faecal white blood cell may be seen.

Memory B cells in systemic and mucosal immune response: implications for successful vaccination.

B-cell memory has been extensively analyzed in the systemic immune response elicited by hapten-carrier antigens, and the regulatory mechanisms underlying the process are beginning to be elucidated. Memory B cells can be generated through heterogeneous pathways within and outside germinal centers (GCs). Once developed, they appear to be maintained like stem cells for long periods by homeostatic proliferation. In response to reencountered antigens, memory B cells robustly secrete antibodies with help of the anti-apoptotic effect of Ras-mediated signals. We have recently found that following intranasal infection with an influenza virus, virus-specific memory B cells develop in the lungs and persist for a long time along with GC B cells and plasma cells; this appears to be unique feature of the mucosal memory response. Thus memory B cell responses in the systemic and mucosal sites are regulated by distinct processes and further understanding of them should provide a theoretical framework for the development of new vaccine strategies.

Identification of a new membrane-associated polypeptide specified by the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus.

Nucleotide sequences from the third open reading frame of mRNA D (D3) of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were expressed in bacteria as part of a fusion protein with beta-galactosidase. Antiserum raised in rabbits against this fusion protein immunoprecipitated from IBV-infected chick kidney or Vero cells a polypeptide of 12.4K, the size expected for a D3-encoded product. The D3 polypeptide is apparently non-glycosylated, and appears to be associated with the membrane fraction of infected cells, as judged by cell fractionation and immunofluorescence.

Acquisition of macrophage tropism during the pathogenesis of feline infectious peritonitis is determined by mutations in the feline coronavirus spike protein.

In feline coronavirus (FCoV) pathogenesis, the ability to infect macrophages is an essential virulence factor. Whereas the low-virulence feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) isolates primarily replicate in the epithelial cells of the enteric tract, highly virulent feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) isolates have acquired the ability to replicate efficiently in macrophages, which allows rapid dissemination of the virulent virus throughout the body. FIPV 79-1146 and FECV 79-1683 are two genetically closely related representatives of the two pathotypes. Whereas FECV 79-1683 causes at the most a mild enteritis in young kittens, FIPV 79-1146 almost invariably induces a lethal peritonitis. The virulence phenotypes correlate with the abilities of these viruses to infect and replicate in macrophages, a feature of FIPV 79-1146 but not of FECV 79-1683. To identify the genetic determinants of the FIPV 79-1146 macrophage tropism, we exchanged regions of its genome with the corresponding parts of FECV 79-1683, after which the ability of the FIPV/FECV hybrid viruses to infect macrophages was tested. Thus, we established that the FIPV spike protein is the determinant for efficient macrophage infection. Interestingly, this property mapped to the C-terminal domain of the protein, implying that the difference in infection efficiency between the two viruses is not determined at the level of receptor usage, which we confirmed by showing that infection by both viruses was equally blocked by antibodies directed against the feline aminopeptidase N receptor. The implications of these findings are discussed.

Adult use of prescription opioid pain medications - Utah, 2008.

Fatal and nonfatal overdoses from prescription pain medications have increased in recent years in Utah and throughout the nation. In 2008, the Utah Department of Health added 12 questions to the state's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey to better understand how state residents obtain and use prescription pain medication. Findings from the survey indicated that an estimated 20.8% of Utah adults aged >or=18 years had been prescribed an opioid pain medication during the preceding 12 months. Of those prescribed an opioid pain medication, 3.2% reported using their medication more frequently or in higher doses than had been directed by their doctor; 72.0% reported having leftover medication, and 71.0% of those with leftover medication reported that they had kept the medication. Approximately 1.8% of all adults reported using prescription opioids that had not been prescribed to them. In 2009, the Utah Department of Health published a set of guidelines to reduce morbidity, mortality, and disability associated with misuse or abuse of prescription drugs, especially narcotics. The guidelines include recommendations that providers 1) counsel patients to dispose of unused medication properly once the pain has resolved and 2) prescribe no more than the number of doses needed based on the usual duration of pain severe enough to require opioids for that condition.

Monkeypox in the United States: an occupational health look at the first cases.

Between May 15 and June 20, 2003, 71 suspected cases of monkeypox were investigated and 37 individuals in the United States developed laboratory confirmed monkeypox. These were the first cases of human monkeypox ever documented in the United States or in the Western Hemisphere. The disease was transmitted from small animals imported from Africa to other animals, including prairie dogs sold as pets throughout the U.S. Midwest. Direct contact with the infected animals was the method of infection, and although human to human transmission was thought to have occurred, this was not confirmed by follow up testing. Because of the link with contact with a prairie dog, initial evaluation of the disease was focused toward diseases commonly associated with this animal (e.g., tularemia, plague). Laboratory findings at the Marshfield Clinic in Marshfield, Wisconsin pointed to the presence of an orthopox. The CDC confirmed monkeypox was the infecting orthopox agent. Occupational health nurses from the Marshfield Clinic had direct involvement in the identification and follow up of employees who had direct contact with the diagnosed patients. Programs, such as a respiratory protection program initiated and carried out by Clinic occupational health nurses, were used to prevent employee exposure for Clinic staff. One Clinic employee was thought to potentially have monkeypox because of her direct contact with one of the patients. Four Clinic employees were vaccinated with vaccinia vaccine as a result of their contact with patients or lab specimens. Quarantine of the potentially infected employee and her boyfriend uncovered issues that must be addressed if other infectious diseases requiring quarantine or isolation of individuals emerge or re-emerge. These include a system to compensate individuals in quarantine or isolation who do not have any other source of income. The issue of whether workers' compensation should cover an employee who is quarantined or isolated for a potential work related exposure to an infectious disease if no disease is actually diagnosed also needs to be explored. A better system of getting state or CDC laboratory results back to the local level, including the occupational health area of the generating facility, must be developed. This will be very important if diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or smallpox should re-emerge in the United States. Occupational health nurses are an integral part of any infectious disease process occurring in the United States. The identification of monkeypox in the United States shows that any planning to detect, prevent, and treat diseases with the potential to affect the employee population must include occupational health nurse involvement.

[Chlamydia-like and coronavirus-like agents found in dead cases of atypical pneumonia by electron microscopy].

OBJECTIVE To explore the causative agents of the atypical pneumonia (also SARS) occurred recently in some regions of our country. METHOD Organ samples of 7 dead cases of SARS were collected from Guangdong, Shanxi, Sichuan Provinces and Beijing for electron microscopic examination. 293 cell line was inoculated with the materials derived from the lungs to isolate causative agent(s). The agents in the organs and cell cultures were revealed by immunoassay. RESULTS Both Chlamydia-like and coronavirus-like particles were found in EM. Inclusion bodies containing elementary bodies, reticulate antibodies and intermediate bodies of Chlamydia-like agent were visualized in multiple organs from the 7 dead cases, including lungs (7 cases), spleens (2 cases), livers (2 cases), kidneys (3 cases) and lymph nodes (1 cases), by ultrathin section electron microscopy (EM). In some few sections, coronavirus-like particles were concurrently seen. A coronavirus RNA- polymerase segment (440 bp) was amplified from the lung tissues of two cases of the SARS. After inoculated with materials from the lung samples, the similar Chlamydia-like particles were also found in the inoculated 293 cells. Since the Chlamydia-like agents visualized in both organs and cell cultures could not react with the genus specific antibodies against Chlamydia and monoclonal antibodies against C. pneumoniae and C. psittaci, the results might well be suggestive of a novel Chlamydia-like agent. CONCLUSION Since the novel Chlamydia-like agent was found co-existing with a coronavirus-like agent in the dead cases of SARS, it looks most likely that both the agents play some roles in the disease. At the present time, however, one can hardly determining how did these agents interact each other synergetically, or one follows another, need further study.

[Hypertension, RAAS blockade and risk in COVID-19 patients].

SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters the host-cells by binding the transmembraneous angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) when causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The role of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) in COVID-19 is debated. Several well-conducted observational studies show no increased risk from RAAS blockade in COVID-19 patients and are detailed in this brief review. The Swedish Society of Hypertension, Stroke and Vascular Medicine supports current recommendations that ongoing RAAS blockade should be maintained in patients with COVID-19.

Inhibitor design for SARS coronavirus main protease based on "distorted key theory".

In order to find effective peptide inhibitors against SARS CoV M(pro), an analysis was performed for 11 oligo-peptides that can be cleaved by the SARS coronavirus main protease (CoV M(pro), or 3CL(pro)). Flexible molecular alignments of the 11 cleavable peptides have provided useful insights into the chemical properties of their amino acid residues close to the cleavage site. Moreover, it was found through the ligand-receptor docking studies that of the 11 cleavable peptides, NH2-ATLQ / AIAS-COOH and NH2-ATLQ / AENV-COOH had the highest affinity with SARS CoV M(pro). The two octapeptides were selected as initial templates for further chemical modification to make them become effective inhibitors against the SARS enzyme according to the "distorted key" theory [K. C. Chou, Analytical Biochemistry 233 (1996) 1-14]. The possible chemical modification methods are proposed and examined. The approach developed in this study and the findings thus obtained might stimulate new strategies and provide useful information for drug design against SARS.

Utility of infrared thermography for screening febrile subjects.

OBJECTIVE To assess the utility of remote-sensing infrared thermography as a screening tool for fever. DESIGN Cross-sectional study comparing body temperatures measured by remote-sensing infrared thermography (maximum for frontal, forehead, or lateral views) with core temperatures measured by aural or oral methods. SETTING Accident and Emergency Department, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS A total of 1517 patients (747 men, 770 women) with or without fever; 34 of whom entered a substudy to measure the effects of distance on recorded temperature. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The proportions of subjects with fever (core temperature of 38°C or above) detected by remote-sensing infrared thermography compared with the proportion detected by conventional thermometry. RESULTS The correlations between infrared thermography temperatures and core temperature were only moderate (r=0.36-0.44), albeit statistically significant. The temperature recorded by infrared thermography was inversely proportional to the distance from the camera. There were 113 (7.4%) subjects with a core temperature of 38°C or above. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the three infrared thermography measurements were around 0.8. However, the maximum sensitivity achieved at a low cut-off temperature of 35°C was only 0.87 (for frontal and lateral infrared thermography views), resulting in 13% of febrile subjects being missed. The maximum forehead temperature in general had the poorest performance among the three infrared thermography views. CONCLUSIONS Forehead infrared thermography readings from a distance should be abandoned for fever screening. Although maximum lateral or frontal infrared thermography temperatures have reasonable correlations with core temperatures and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves, the sensitivity-specificity combination might still not be high enough for screening febrile conditions, especially at border crossings with huge numbers of passengers.

What are the chances? Evaluating risk and benefit information in consumer health materials.

Much consumer health information addresses issues of disease risk or treatment risks and benefits, addressing questions such as "How effective is this treatment?" or "What is the likelihood that this test will give a false positive result?" Insofar as it addresses outcome likelihood, this information is essentially quantitative in nature, which is of critical importance, because quantitative information tends to be difficult to understand and therefore inaccessible to consumers. Information professionals typically examine reading level to determine the accessibility of consumer health information, but this measure does not adequately reflect the difficulty of quantitative information, including materials addressing issues of risk and benefit. As a result, different methods must be used to evaluate this type of consumer health material. There are no standard guidelines or assessment tools for this task, but research in cognitive psychology provides insight into the best ways to present risk and benefit information to promote understanding and minimize interpretation bias. This paper offers an interdisciplinary bridge that brings these results to the attention of information professionals, who can then use them to evaluate consumer health materials addressing risks and benefits.

Retrospective evidence that the MHC (B haplotype) of chickens influences genetic resistance to attenuated infectious bronchitis vaccine strains in chickens.

Infectious bronchitis is a respiratory disease of chickens that is caused by the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Virtually all broiler and layer breeder flocks are routinely vaccinated against IBV. Two hatches of 1-day-old chicks from four lines were mistakenly vaccinated for infectious bronchitis using a moderately attenuated vaccine designed for chicks of an older age. The vaccination resulted in high mortality, and chicks from three of four lines died with signs typical of infectious bronchitis. The mortality that occurred using this less-attenuated vaccine was significantly influenced by the genetic line, and the MHC (B) haplotype in chickens of three B congenic lines. B congenic chickens possessing the B*15 haplotype were resistant in contrast to chickens possessing the B*13 or B*21 haplotypes. Chicks from two further hatches of the four lines were vaccinated appropriately with a more attenuated IBV vaccine, and only limited chick mortality was seen. These retrospective data from two repeated hatches confirm earlier data indicating chicken genes influence resistance to IBV, and indicate for the first time that genes tightly linked to the B haplotype are relevant in resistance to IBV. Due to extenuating circumstances it was not possible to verify results with chicks from F2 matings. Factors that may enhance definition of the role of the B haplotype in immune response to IBV, and the desirability for further analysis of a B haplotype-linked influence on immunity to IBV are discussed.

Smallpox and bioterrorism.

Smallpox was declared to be eradicated on 8 May 1980, during the Thirty-third World Health Assembly. However, concerns about the possible use of the virus as a weapon of bioterrorism have increased in recent years. Governments have responded by initiating selective vaccination programmes and other public health measures. This review uses historical data from 20th century outbreaks to assess the risks to current populations (which have declining immunity) from a deliberate release of virus. The data presented supports the conclusion of a previous reviewer (Mack) that "smallpox cannot be said to live up to its reputation. Far from being a quick-footed menace, it has appeared as a plodding nuisance with more bark than bite." Its R value (the average number of secondary cases infected by a primary case) is lower than that for measles, human parvovirus, chickenpox, mumps, rubella, and poliomyelitis; only the value for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is lower. Like SARS, close person-to-person contact is required for effective spread of the disease, and exposure to the virus in hospitals has played an important role in transmission for both viruses. In the present paper the dangers of mass vaccination are emphasized, along with the importance of case isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine of close contacts for outbreak control. The need for rapid diagnosis and the continued importance of maintaining a network of electron microscopes for this purpose are also highlighted.

Intracellular transport of recombinant coronavirus spike proteins: implications for virus assembly.

Coronavirus spike protein genes were expressed in vitro by using the recombinant vaccinia virus expression system. Recombinant spike proteins were expressed at the cell surface and induced cell fusion in a host-cell-dependent fashion. The intracellular transport of recombinant spike proteins was studied. The half time of acquisition of resistance to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H was approximately 3 h for the recombinant feline infectious peritonitis virus S protein. The S protein in feline infectious peritonitis virus-infected cells was found to have a half time of acquisition of resistance to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H of approximately 1 h. This difference can be explained by the fact that coronavirus budding takes place at intracellular membranes and that the oligosaccharides of the spike protein are modified after budding. Apparently, spike protein incorporated into budded virions is transported faster through the Golgi apparatus than is spike protein alone. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of coronavirus budding and are discussed in relation to current models of intracellular transport and sorting of proteins.

Infection by coronavirus JHM of rat neurons and oligodendrocyte-type-2 astrocyte lineage cells during distinct developmental stages.

Primary telencephalic cultures derived from neonatal Wistar Furth rats were able to support the growth of coronavirus JHM if a viable neuronal population was maintained. This occurred under serum-free defined, but not serum-supplemented, growth conditions. The importance of neurons in establishing infections in mixed cultures was confirmed by immunocytochemical and electron microscopic studies. Glia, although more abundant than neurons in these cultures, were less frequently infected during the initial 48 h postinoculation. The two glial lineages present in mixed telencephalic cultures were separated into type-1 astrocytes and oligodendrocyte-type-2 astrocyte (O-2A) lineage cells and individually assessed for their ability to support virus growth. Infection could not be established in type-1 astrocytes regardless of the culture conditions employed, consistent with our previous study (S. Beushausen and S. Dales, Virology 141:89-101, 1985). In contrast, infections could be initiated in selected O-2A lineage cells grown in serum-free medium. Virus multiplication was however significantly reduced by preconditioning the medium with mixed telencephalic or enriched type-1 astrocyte cultures, suggesting that intercellular interactions mediated by soluble factor(s) can influence the infectious process in O-2A lineage cells. This presumption was supported by eliciting similar effects with basic fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, two central nervous system cytokines known to control O-2A differentiation. The presence of these cytokines, which synergistically block O-2A cells from differentiating into oligodendrocytes was correlated with specific and reversible resistance to JHM virus (JHMV) infection. These data, combined with our finding that accelerated terminal differentiation of the oligodendrocyte phenotype confers resistance to JHMV (Beushausen and Dales, Virology, 1985), suggest that the permissiveness of O-2A cells for JHMV is restricted to a discrete developmental stage.

Coronavirus IBV: further evidence that the surface projections are associated with two glycopolypeptides.

The surface projections (peplomers) of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain M41 have been separated from the nucleocapsid (N) and matrix (M) proteins by sedimentation in a sucrose gradient after virus disruption by the non-ionic detergent Nonidet P40. The peplomers comprised two glycopolypeptides of mol. wt. 90 X 10(3) (90K; S1) and 84K (S2), shown by analysis of differentially radiolabelled virus to be present in equimolar proportions. Polypeptides of 75K and 110K, which were detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining in similar amounts to S1 and S2 in some unlabelled virus preparations, were absent from peplomer preparations and are probably host cell polypeptides. The S1:S2:N:M polypeptide molar ratio for IBV-M41 was approximately 1:1:6:15.

VaZyMolO: a tool to define and classify modularity in viral proteins.

Viral structural genomic projects aim at unveiling the function of unknown viral proteins by employing high-throughput approaches to determine their 3D structure and to identify their function through fold-homology studies. The 'viral enzyme module localization' (VaZyMolO) tool has been developed, which aims at defining viral protein modules that might be expressed in a soluble and functionally active form, thereby identifying candidates for crystallization studies. VaZyMolO includes 114 complete viral genome sequences of both negative- and positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses available from NCBI. In VaZyMolO, a module is defined as a structural and/or functional unit. Modules were first identified by homology search and then validated by the convergence of results from sequence composition analysis, motif search, transmembrane region search and domain definitions, as found in the literature. The public interface of VaZyMolO, which is accessible from http://www.vazymolo.org, allows comparison of a query sequence to all VaZyMolO modules of known function.

Infection control, ethics and accountability.

Health care-associated infections (HAIs) are a major clinical and economic problem in Australian hospitals, and a significant proportion are preventable. HAIs are the result of complex environmental, microbiological, pathological, behavioural and organisational factors, and prevention requires a multifaceted ("bundled") approach, including appropriate policies, educational programs for health care workers, and adequate resources to implement them effectively. Failure to protect patients from avoidable harm, including HAIs, has significant ethical implications; it often reflects both organisational systems failure and non-compliance of health care workers with evidence-based policies, including hand hygiene. If implemented with appropriate safeguards, infection control "bundles" that include sanctions for poor compliance with hand hygiene and other infection control policies, will achieve sustained improvements where previous approaches have failed.

Optimization of immunohistochemical methods using two different antigen retrieval methods on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues: experience with 63 markers.

Formalin fixation produces cross-links between the proteins and the fixative that alter the ability of some antibodies to recognize antigens. We used formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues to compare two different antigen retrieval methods for 63 antibodies used in the diagnosis of infectious and neoplastic diseases of animal species. Eighty-four percent of the antibodies needed some type of antigen retrieval for optimal results. Of those antibodies, 67.7% were monoclonal and 32.3% were polyclonal. Steam heat was the method of choice for 31 antibodies. Ten antibodies reacted only with steam heat, but 9 antibodies did not react when steam heat was used. Optimal results were obtained with enzyme digestion for 22 antibodies. Only 10 antibodies yielded optimal results without antigen retrieval; 64% of these antibodies were polyclonal. All antibodies against cytokeratins were optimally retrieved with proteinese K. Antigen retrieval appears to be necessary for the majority of antibodies when used with formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.

Identification of residues critical for the human coronavirus 229E receptor function of human aminopeptidase N.

Aminopeptidase N (APN) is the major cell surface receptor for group 1 coronaviruses. In this study, we have isolated and characterized a feline APN cDNA and shown that the transfection of human embryonic kidney cells with this cDNA renders them susceptible to infection with the feline coronavirus feline infectious peritonitis virus, the human coronavirus (HCV) 229E and the porcine coronavirus porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. By using chimeric APN genes, assembled from porcine and feline sequences, we have shown that, analogously to the human APN protein, a region within the amino-terminal part of the feline APN protein (encompassing amino acids 132-295) is essential for its HCV 229E receptor function. Furthermore, by comparing the relevant feline, human and porcine APN sequences, we were able to identify a hypervariable stretch of eight amino acids that are more closely related in the feline and human APN proteins than in the porcine APN molecule. Using PCR-directed mutagenesis, we converted this stretch of amino acids within the porcine APN molecule to the corresponding residues of the human APN molecule. These changes were sufficient to convert porcine APN into a functional receptor for HCV 229E and thus define a small number of residues that are critically important for the HCV 229E receptor function of human APN.

Analysis of deaths during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Singapore: challenges in determining a SARS diagnosis.

CONTEXT An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an infectious disease attributed to a novel coronavirus, occurred in Singapore during the first quarter of 2003 and led to 204 patients with diagnosed illnesses and 26 deaths by May 2, 2003. Twenty-one percent of these patients required admission to the medical intensive care unit. During this period, the Center for Forensic Medicine, Health Sciences Authority, Singapore, performed a total of 14 postmortem examinations for probable and suspected SARS. Of these, a total of 8 were later confirmed as SARS infections. OBJECTIVE Our series documents the difficulties encountered at autopsy during the initial phases of the SARS epidemic, when the pattern of infection and definitive diagnostic laboratory criteria were yet to be established. DESIGN Autopsies were performed by pathologists affiliated with the Center for Forensic Medicine, Health Sciences Authority, Singapore. Tissue was accessed and read at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, and at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, DC. Autopsy tissue was submitted to the Virology Department, Singapore General Hospital, for analysis, and in situ hybridization for the SARS coronavirus was carried out at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan. RESULTS Thirteen of 14 patients showed features of diffuse alveolar damage. In 8 patients, no precipitating etiology was identified, and in all of these patients, we now have laboratory confirmation of coronavirus infection. Two of the 8 patients presented at autopsy as sudden unexpected deaths, while the remaining 6 patients had been hospitalized with varying lengths of stay in the intensive care unit. In 3 patients, including the 2 sudden unexpected deaths, in situ hybridization showed the presence of virally infected cells within the lung. In 4 of the 8 SARS patients, pulmonary thromboemboli were also recognized on gross examination, while one patient had marantic cardiac valvular vegetations. CONCLUSIONS It is unfortunate that the term atypical pneumonia has been used in conjunction with SARS. Although nonspecific by itself, the term does not accurately reflect the underlying dangers of viral pneumonia, which may progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome. We observed that the clinical spectrum of disease as seen in our autopsy series included sudden deaths. This is a worrisome finding that illustrates that viral diseases will have a spectrum of clinical presentations and that the diagnoses made for such patients must incorporate laboratory as well as clinical data.

Neonatal calf diarrhea caused by a virus that induces villous epithelial cell syncytia.

Intestinal lesions caused by a virus serologically unrelated to the calf diarrheal rotavirus or coronavirus were studied in gnotobiotic calves. The virion purified from feces from infected calves was a fringed particle with a diameter of about 100 nm. The incubation period from time of inoculation per orum to onset of diarrhea in calves was as short as 8 hours. The viral infection in bacteria-free calves or calves not contaminated with pathogenic bacteria caused severe illness for only 24 hours. When bacteria such as the K99 antigen Escherichia coli were present, the combined infection caused mortality. Lesions occurred only in the small intestinal villous epithelium. Calves euthanatized shortly before or after the onset of diarrhea had developed villous epithelial cell syncytia that contained numberous virions in the cytoplasm. Within 2 to 3 hours after onset of diarrhea, the infected cells were shed and the villi had denuded tips or had cuboidal to squamous epithelial cells.

RNA helicase activity of the plant virus movement proteins encoded by the first gene of the triple gene block.

Cell-to-cell and long-distance transport of some plant viruses requires coordinated action of three movement proteins encoded by triple gene block (TGB). The largest of TGB proteins, TGBp1, is a member of the superfamily I of DNA/RNA helicases and possesses a set of conserved helicase sequence motifs necessary for virus movement. A recombinant His-tagged form of TGBp1 of two hordeiviruses and potato virus X, a potexvirus, produced in Escherichia coli had unwinding activity on a partially duplexed RNA, but not DNA substrate. The helicase activity of these proteins was dependent on Mg2+ and ATP. The isolated C-terminal half of the PSLV TGBp1 retaining all helicase motifs was also able to unwind RNA duplex.

Public health measures to control the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome during the outbreak in Toronto.

BACKGROUND Toronto was the site of North America's largest outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). An understanding of the patterns of transmission and the effects on public health in relation to control measures that were taken will help health officials prepare for any future outbreaks. METHODS We analyzed SARS case, quarantine, and hotline records in relation to control measures. The two phases of the outbreak were compared. RESULTS Toronto Public Health investigated 2132 potential cases of SARS, identified 23,103 contacts of SARS patients as requiring quarantine, and logged 316,615 calls on its SARS hotline. In Toronto, 225 residents met the case definition of SARS, and all but 3 travel-related cases were linked to the index patient, from Hong Kong. SARS spread to 11 (58 percent) of Toronto's acute care hospitals. Unrecognized SARS among in-patients with underlying illness caused a resurgence, or a second phase, of the outbreak, which was finally controlled through active surveillance of hospitalized patients. In response to the control measures of Toronto Public Health, the number of persons who were exposed to SARS in nonhospital and nonhousehold settings dropped from 20 (13 percent) before the control measures were instituted (phase 1) to 0 afterward (phase 2). The number of patients who were exposed while in a hospital ward rose from 25 (17 percent) in phase 1 to 68 (88 percent) in phase 2, and the number exposed while in the intensive care unit dropped from 13 (9 percent) in phase 1 to 0 in phase 2. Community spread (the length of the chains of transmission outside of hospital settings) was significantly reduced in phase 2 of the outbreak (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The transmission of SARS in Toronto was limited primarily to hospitals and to households that had had contact with patients. For every case of SARS, health authorities should expect to quarantine up to 100 contacts of the patients and to investigate 8 possible cases. During an outbreak, active in-hospital surveillance for SARS-like illnesses and heightened infection-control measures are essential.

Respiratory viral infections in transplant recipients.

A wide range of viruses affect the respiratory tract of transplant recipients, including adenovirus, influenza, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus. Prospective studies using contemporary diagnostic techniques have recently improved our understanding of the epidemiology and importance of these respiratory viruses among transplant recipients. From these studies, rhinovirus, in particular, has been shown to be one of the most common causes of infection in stem cell and lung transplant recipients. In addition to epidemiological data, recent studies have also advanced our understanding of management of influenza, adenovirus, and RSV infections among transplant recipients.

Human coronavirus 229E infects polarized airway epithelia from the apical surface.

Gene transfer to differentiated airway epithelia with existing viral vectors is very inefficient when they are applied to the apical surface. This largely reflects the polarized distribution of receptors on the basolateral surface. To identify new receptor-ligand interactions that might be used to redirect vectors to the apical surface, we investigated the process of infection of airway epithelial cells by human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), a common cause of respiratory tract infections. Using immunohistochemistry, we found the receptor for HCoV-229E (CD13 or aminopeptidase N) localized mainly to the apical surface of airway epithelia. When HCoV-229E was applied to the apical or basolateral surface of well-differentiated primary cultures of human airway epithelia, infection primarily occurred from the apical side. Similar results were noted when the virus was applied to cultured human tracheal explants. Newly synthesized virions were released mainly to the apical side. Thus, HCoV-229E preferentially infects human airway epithelia from the apical surface. The spike glycoprotein that mediates HCoV-229E binding and fusion to CD13 is a candidate for pseudotyping retroviral envelopes or modifying other viral vectors.

Intrahepatic alpha beta-TcRintermediate LFA-1high T cells are stimulated during mouse hepatitis viral infection.

Mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3), a coronavirus, is an excellent animal model for the study of thymic and extrathymic T cell subpopulation disorders induced during the viral hepatitis. To understand local hepatic immune responses, the phenotypes of resident hepatic lymphocytes were determined and compared that of splenic and thymic T cell subpopulations during the acute viral hepatitis induced by MHV3 in susceptible C57BL/6 mice. Single positive (SP) CD4+ or CD8+ cells strongly increased in the liver. A specific cell population, the double positive (CD4+ C8+) cells, normally present in liver and thymic cell preparations, decreased in C57BL/6 mice following the viral infection. alpha beta-TcRintermediate T cells shifted toward alpha beta-TcRhigh T cells in the liver and thymus of infected mice, but not in their spleen. The specific alpha beta-TcRint or high lymphocytes occurring in the liver of MHV3-infected mice expressed higher levels of leukocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1) and Pgp-1 (CD44) activation markers, suggesting that they were either activated or antigen-experienced during the viral infection. No significant changes in T cell subpopulations were detected in the spleen. These observations suggest that MHV3 infection could induce an early in situ stimulation of resident hepatic T cells, despite a peripheral immunodeficiency in the thymus and spleen.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome: radiographic review of 40 probable cases in Toronto, Canada.

PURPOSE To review radiographic findings of patients with probable severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) who were seen at a University of Toronto (Ontario, Canada) teaching hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS Findings were reviewed for 40 patients who fulfilled the World Health Organization criteria for probable SARS. A template was designed for the analysis of each serial radiograph to observe patterns and distribution of disease, interval changes, and complications. The majority of radiographs were anteroposterior views. A clinical database of these patients was also collected for clinical-radiologic comparison. RESULTS The mean age of the patients (18 male, 22 female) was 42.7 years. Patients had a normal chest radiograph and focal, multifocal, and/or bilateral consolidation. The pattern of consolidation tended to be peripheral and poorly marginated and involved middle and lower lung zones. The serial sequence fell into two major subgroups, which correlated closely with clinical outcome. Consolidation in one group cleared within a matter of days, while the second group went on to develop rapid and extensive bilateral pneumonia, with a prolonged hospital stay. Subsegmental atelectasis and pleural complications were rarely observed. CONCLUSION SARS pneumonia can manifest as focal peripheral consolidation that clears relatively quickly and does not cause secondary complications or that progresses to bilateral consolidation and a more protracted clinical course.

Population proteomics: addressing protein diversity in humans.

In the past several years, proteomics and its subdiscipline clinical proteomics have been engaged in the discovery of the next generation protein of biomarkers. As the effort and the intensive debate it has sparked continue, it is becoming apparent that a paradigm shift is needed in proteomics in order to truly comprehend the complexity of the human proteome and assess its subtle variations among individuals. This review introduces the concept of population proteomics as a future direction in proteomics research. Population proteomics is the study of protein diversity in human populations. High-throughput, top-down mass spectrometric approaches are employed to investigate, define and understand protein diversity and modulations across and within populations. Population proteomics is a discovery-oriented endeavor with a goal of establishing the incidence of protein structural variations and quantitative regulation of these modifications. Assessing human protein variations among and within populations is viewed as a paramount undertaking that can facilitate clinical proteomics' effort in discovery and validation of protein features that can be used as markers for early diagnosis of disease, monitoring of disease progression and assessment of therapy. This review outlines the growing need for analyzing individuals' proteomes and describes the approaches that are likely to be applied in such a population proteomics endeavor.

Functional domains in the retroviral transmembrane protein.

The envelope glycoproteins of the mammalian type C retroviruses consist of two subunits, a surface (SU) protein and a transmembrane (TM) protein. SU binds to the viral receptor and is thought to trigger conformational changes in the associated TM protein that ultimately lead to the fusion of viral and host cell membranes. For Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV), the envelope protein probably exists as a trimer. We have previously demonstrated that the coexpression of envelope proteins that are individually defective in either the SU or TM subunits can lead to functional complementation (Y. Zhao et al., J. Virol. 71:6967-6972, 1997). We have now extended these studies to investigate the abilities of a panel of fusion-defective TM mutants to complement each other. This analysis identified distinct complementation groups within TM, with implications for interactions between different regions of TM in the fusion process. In viral particles, the C-terminal 16 amino acids of the MoMuLV TM (the R peptide) are cleaved by the viral protease, resulting in an increased fusogenicity of the envelope protein. We have examined the consequences of R peptide cleavage for the different TM fusion mutants and have found that this enhancement of fusogenicity can only occur in cis to certain of the TM mutants. These results suggest that R peptide cleavage enhances the fusogenicity of the envelope protein by influencing the interaction of two distinct regions in the TM ectodomain.

Distribution and trafficking of JHM coronavirus structural proteins and virions in primary neurons and the OBL-21 neuronal cell line.

The neurotropic murine coronavirus JHM is capable of inducing various forms of neurologic diseases, including demyelination. Neurons have been shown to act as a repository site at the early stages of the disease process (O. Sorensen and S. Dales, J. Virol. 56:434-438, 1985). JHM virus (JHMV) replication and trafficking of viral proteins and virions in cultured rat hippocampal neurons and a neuronal cell line, OBL-21, were examined, with an emphasis placed on the role of the microtubular network. We show here that JHMV spread within the central nervous system occurs transneuronally and that virus protein trafficking was dependent upon microtubules. Viral trafficking occurred asymmetrically, involving both the somatodendritic and the axonal domains. Thus coronavirus can be disseminated from neurons at either the basolateral or the apical domains. A specific interaction between antibodies derived against the microtubule-associated protein tau and JHMV nucleocapsid protein (N) was observed, which can presumably be explained by an overall amino acid similarity of 44% and an identity of 20% between proteins N and tau, with optimal alignment at the microtubule binding domain of tau. Collectively, our data suggest an important role of the microtubule network in viral protein trafficking and distribution. They also draw attention to protein sequence mimicry of a cell component by this coronavirus as one strategy for making use of the host's functions on behalf of the virus.

Depression, anxiety, body image, sexual functioning, and dyadic adjustment associated with dialysis type in chronic renal failure.

OBJECTIVE Depression is the most widely studied complication in dialysis patients. In patients with chronic renal failure, changes in body image are considered to be associated with invasive treatment interventions. In addition, sexual problems are common in dialysis patients. In this study, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients are investigated for depression, anxiety, body image, sexual satisfaction, and dyadic adjustment. METHODS Hemodialysis patients (n = 36), peritoneal dialysis patients (n = 54), and healthy controls (n = 30) were included in the study. All the subjects were assessed with Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Body Image Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Scale, Golombok-Rust Inventory for Sexual Satisfaction, and Dyadic Adjustment Scale. RESULTS Depression (20.64 +/- 15.20) and anxiety levels (14.72 +/- 12.36) were significantly higher in hemodialysis group compared to peritoneal dialysis (13.54 +/- 12.51; 12.74 +/- 11.21) and control groups (7.17 +/- 5.58; 9.86 +/- 9.19). In peritoneal dialysis group, as depression and anxiety levels increased, body image was disturbed and sexual satisfaction decreased. In peritoneal dialysis group, body image (86.98 +/- 23.63) was better than hemodialysis group (101.58 +/- 26.51) and was not different from the control group (83.67 +/- 22.11). In hemodialysis group, as depression and anxiety levels increased, body image was disturbed. In both groups, long-term dialysis disturbed body image. CONCLUSION Patients should be informed about the impacts of dialysis. Clinicians may wish to monitor dialysis-users for anxiety, depression, dyadic adjustment, and body image difficulties at follow-up appointments. Interventions that target intimate partner interventions, appearance-related beliefs, and anxiety depression may be of benefit to this population.

Transcription strategy of coronaviruses: fusion of non-contiguous sequences during mRNA synthesis.

MHV replicates in the cell cytoplasm and viral genetic information is expressed in infected cells as one genomic sized RNA ( mRNA1 ) and six subgenomic mRNAs. The seven RNAs were assumed to have common 3' ends of the size of RNA7 , the smallest RNA. The data reported here, show that this model is too simple and that the mRNAs are composed of a leader and body sequence. Electron microscopic analysis of hybrids formed between single stranded cDNA copied from mRNA7 and genomic RNA or mRNA6 shows that genomic RNA, mRNA6 and mRNA7 have common 5' terminal sequences. Furthermore, nucleotide sequence analysis shows that the nucleotide sequence of the 5' end of mRNA7 diverges from the corresponding region of the genome just upstream from the initiation codon of the nucleocapsid gene. Because the synthesis of each mRNA is inactivated by UV irradiation in proportion to its own length, the subgenomic mRNAs are apparently not produced by the processing of larger RNAs. The available data have to be explained by translocation of the polymerase/leader complex to specific internal positions on the negative strand. In this way the leader and body sequences are joined together by a mechanism completely different from conventional RNA splicing but nevertheless giving the same end result.

Identification and subcellular localization of a 41 kDa, polyprotein 1ab processing product in human coronavirus 229E-infected cells.

The translation products of the human coronavirus (HCV) 229E open reading frames 1a and 1b, the polyproteins 1a and 1ab, are processed by virus-encoded proteinases. One of the key enzymes in this process is a chymotrypsin-like enzyme, the 3C-like proteinase. In this study we have identified an ORF 1b-encoded, 41 kDa processing product in HCV 229E-infected cells by using a monoclonal antibody with defined specificity. We show that this polypeptide is released from polyprotein 1ab by 3C-like proteinase-mediated cleavage of the peptide bonds Gln-6110/Gly-6111 and Gln-6458/Ser-6459. Also, we have investigated the subcellular localization of the 41 kDa processing product. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a punctate, perinuclear distribution of the 41 kDa polypeptide in infected cells and an identical subcellular localization was observed for three additional pp1ab-derived polypeptides. In contrast, the virus nucleocapsid protein showed a homogeneous cytoplasmic localization.

Molecular detection and serotyping of infectious bronchitis virus from FTA filter paper.

We investigated the feasibility of using Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) filter cards for the storage of allantoic fluid containing an infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), such as Arkansas-DPI, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, and for their identification by reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and characterization by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) or nucleotide sequencing. FTA paper is a cotton-based cellulose membrane containing lyophilized chemicals that lyses many types of bacteria and viruses. IBV was inactivated upon contact with the FTA, as shown by the inability of the virus to be propagated in embryonating chicken eggs. RT-PCR of the S1 gene showed that viral RNA in allantoic fluid remained stable after storage on FTA filter cards and that the stability was time and temperature sensitive for the large (1700 base pair [bp]) but not the small (383 bp) PCR products. Analysis of the amplified products showed that molecular characterization is feasible in allantoic fluid stored on FTA under nonfavorable environmental conditions (41 C) for at least 15 days. The use of FTA cards for the collection, transport, and storage of IBV-containing samples is safe, inexpensive, and adequate for molecular diagnosis. We propose that specimens coming from overseas on FTA cards would be first analyzed by RT-PCR with primers yielding a 1700-bp product followed by RFLP of the positive cases. Negative cases would be analyzed with primers yielding a 383-bp product (to exdude detrimental effect of the storage conditions) followed by nucleotide sequencing of the positive cases.

Topology of the membrane-associated hepatitis C virus protein NS4B.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) belongs to the Hepacivirus genus in the Flaviviridae family. Among the least known viral proteins in this family is the nonstructural protein NS4B, which has been suggested to be a part of the replication complex. Hydrophobicity plots indicate a common profile among the NS4B proteins from different members of the Flaviviridae family, suggesting a common function. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of HCV NS4B, we have determined localization and topology of this protein by using recombinant HCV NS4B constructs. The protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but also induced a pattern of cytoplasmic foci positive for markers of the ER. Computer predictions of the membrane topology of NS4B suggested that it has four transmembrane segments. The N and C termini were anticipated to be localized in the cytoplasm, because they are processed by the cytoplasmic NS3 protein. By introducing glycosylation sites at various positions in HCV NS4B, we show that the C terminus is cytoplasmic and the loop around residue 161 is lumenal as predicted. Surprisingly, the N-terminal tail was translocated into the lumen in a considerable fraction of the NS4B molecules, most likely by a posttranslational process. Interestingly, NS4B proteins of the yellow fever and dengue viruses also have their N termini located in the ER lumen due to an N-terminal signal peptide not found in NS4B of HCV. A shared topology achieved in two different ways supports the notion of a common function for NS4B in FLAVIVIRIDAE:

Comparison of Absorbable Versus Nonabsorbable Tackers in Terms of Long-term Outcomes, Chronic Pain, and Quality of Life After Laparoscopic Incisional Hernia Repair: A Randomized Study.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic incisional and ventral hernia repair (LIVHR) has been associated with a high incidence acute and chronic pain due to use of nonabsorbable tackers. Several absorbable tackers have been introduced to overcome these complications. This randomized study was done to compare 2 techniques of mesh fixation, that is, nonabsorbable versus absorbable tackers for LIVHR. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ninety patients admitted for LIVHR repair (defect size <15 cm) were randomized into 2 groups: nonabsorbable tacker fixation (NAT group, 45 patients) and absorbable tacker fixation (AT group, 45 patients). Intraoperative variables and postoperative outcomes were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS Patients in both the groups were comparable in terms of demographic profile and hernia characteristics. Mesh fixation time and operation time were also comparable. There was no significant difference in the incidence of immediate postoperative and chronic pain over a mean follow-up of 8.8 months. However, cost of the procedure was significantly higher in AT group (P<0.01) and NAT fixation was more cost effective as compared with AT. Postoperative quality of life outcomes and patient satisfaction scores were also comparable. CONCLUSIONS NAT is a cost-effective method of mesh fixation in patients undergoing LIVHR with comparable early and late postoperative outcomes in terms of pain, quality of life, and patient satisfaction scores.

[Use of glucocorticoid in treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome cases].

OBJECTIVE To explore the effect of glucocorticoid in the treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS Clinical data of 70 patients with SARS admitted to Youan Hospital in Beijing during March to May, 2003 were analyzed. RESULTS (1) Sixty-three of 70 cases of SARS recovered and seven cases died, with a case-fatality ratio of 10%. (2) Average length of hospital stay was 16.9 days for the all 70 cases, and 16.8 days for the 11 cases without glucocorticoid treatment, without statistical significance (F = 1.018, P = 0.39). (3) The other 59 cases were administered with 40 mg to 640 mg of methylprednisolone daily. (4) Average hospital stay was 15 days for the 23 cases with lower dose of 40 mg to 80 mg methylprednisolone daily, 18.5 days for the 27 cases with medium dose of 120 mg to 240 mg daily, and 17.9 days for the nine cases with higher dose of 320 mg to 640 mg daily (F = 1.018, P = 0.39). CONCLUSIONS Earlier use of glucocorticoid therapy with suitable doses could alleviate their clinical symptoms, improve their clinical courses, and promote the absorbance of infiltration in their lungs on chest-X-ray films for the cases with SARS. However, current clinical data showed that glucocorticoid therapy could not shorten the length of hospitalization for the cases with SARS.

Training in Neurology: Adoption of resident teleneurology training in the wake of COVID-19: Telemedicine crash course

The current COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we engage patient care, with a move toward telemedicine-based healthcare encounters. Teleneurology is now being rapidly embraced by neurologists in clinics and hospitals nationwide but for many, this paradigm of care is unfamiliar. Exposure to telemedicine in neurology training programs is scarce despite previous calls to expand teleneurology education. Programs that do provide a teleneurology curriculum have demonstrated increased proficiency, accuracy, and post-training utilization among their trainees. With the current changes in healthcare, broad incorporation of teleneurology education in resident and fellow training after this pandemic dissipates will only serve to improve trainee preparedness for independent practice.The current COVID-19 pandemic is forcing a reckoning of current healthcare delivery and expediting a rapid transition to telemedicine-based care. Even in 2017, the Telemedicine Work Group of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) recommended a teleneurology curriculum as an elective rotation for trainees1 How long ago 2017 seems now as we all hastily work to create operational teleneurology infrastructure in our clinics and hospitals. Although prior exposure in teleneurology is advantageous in tackling the complexities of moving to telehealth-based care, most of the neurology workforce is not formally trained in telemedicine. While we are far from fully understanding the long-term sequelae of this pandemic on our healthcare systems, broader exposure and increased comfort with teleneurology is imperative to prepare our trainees for the new world of medicine they will face after this current pandemic dissipates.

SARS-COV-2 infection (coronavirus disease 2019) for the gastrointestinal consultant

The current pandemic due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused an extreme burden for health care systems globally, and the number of cases is expected to continue to increase, at least in the immediate future. The virus is estimated to have infected more than 1.5 million individuals. The available reports suggest that gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is common and in some cases the GI symptoms may precede the respiratory symptoms. In addition to direct effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the infected patients remain at risk for the complications commonly managed by gastroenterology and hepatology consultants. The most commonly reported GI manifestation of COVID-19 is diarrhea, which is reported in a third to up to more than half of the patients. Mild to moderate elevation of the liver enzymes are also common, although no case of acute liver failure has been reported so far. Many of the medications used for treatment of COVID-19 can also be associated with GI symptoms or liver injury and can be included in the differential diagnosis in these patients. Although the diagnosis of the infection is currently based on RNA analysis in respiratory samples, the available literature on fecal shedding of this virus suggests that fecal RNA testing might prove to be a useful diagnostic test. It is reasonable to delay all non-urgent endoscopic procedures during the peak of the pandemic and use additional protective equipment such as N95 respirators during endoscopy while most patients can be considered high risk for having been exposed to the virus.

Divergent modes of online collective attention to the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with future caseload variance

Using a random 10% sample of tweets authored from 2019-09-01 through 2020-04-30, we analyze the dynamic behavior of words (1-grams) used on Twitter to describe the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Across 24 languages, we find two distinct dynamic regimes: One characterizing the rise and subsequent collapse in collective attention to the initial Coronavirus outbreak in late January, and a second that represents March COVID-19-related discourse. Aggregating countries by dominant language use, we find that volatility in the first dynamic regime is associated with future volatility in new cases of COVID-19 roughly three weeks (average 22.49 $\pm$ 3.26 days) later. Our results suggest that surveillance of change in usage of epidemiology-related words on social media may be useful in forecasting later change in disease case numbers, but we emphasize that our current findings are not causal or necessarily predictive.

Analyzing COVID-19 on Online Social Media: Trends, Sentiments and Emotions

At the time of writing, the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused severe impacts on society, economy and people's daily lives. People constantly express their opinions on various aspects of the pandemic on social media, making user-generated content an important source for understanding public emotions and concerns. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis on the affective trajectories of the American people and the Chinese people based on Twitter and Weibo posts between January 20th, 2020 and May 11th 2020. Specifically, by identifying people's sentiments, emotions (i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise) and the emotional triggers (e.g., what a user is angry/sad about) we are able to depict the dynamics of public affect in the time of COVID-19. By contrasting two very different countries, China and the Unites States, we reveal sharp differences in people's views on COVID-19 in different cultures. Our study provides a computational approach to unveiling public emotions and concerns on the pandemic in real-time, which would potentially help policy-makers better understand people's need and thus make optimal policy.

Recognition and management of respiratory coinfection and secondary bacterial pneumonia in patients with COVID-19

The pathophysiology of COVID-19 is not fully known. Respiratory infection caused by more than one viral pathogen (viral co-infection) or both viral and bacterial pathogens (combined viral and bacterial pneumonia) have been described. Secondary bacterial pneumonia can follow the initial phase of viral respiratory infection or occur during the recovery phase. No obvious pattern or guidelines exist for viral coinfection, combined viral and bacterial pneumonia, or secondary bacterial pneumonia in the context of SARS-CoV-2. Based on existing clinical data and experience with similar viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV, the management approach in the context of COVID-19 should, ideally, take into consideration the overall presentation as well as the trajectory of illness.

Positive RT-PCR in urine from an asymptomatic patient with novel coronavirus 2019 infection: a case report

Introduction: With the emergence of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in many countries, medical resources currently focus on the treatment of confirmed patients and screening of suspected cases. Asymptomatic patients may be contagious, which makes epidemic control difficult. We describe an asymptomatic patient with a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in urine.Case report: An asymptomatic girl was identified during the epidemiological investigation of a confirmed COVID-19 patient. When admitted to the hospital on 24 February 2020, she had no clinical manifestations. A throat swab was negative for RT-PCR, but urine was positive. She was given antiviral and symptomatic supportive treatment. On 26 February, a throat swab RT-PCR was positive. RT-PCR in throat swabs and urine were negative on 3 and 5 March, and on 9 and 12 March, throat swabs were still negative. At follow-up on 26 March, she felt well, throat swab RT-PCR was negative, and isolation was lifted.Conclusion: The urine of asymptomatic patients may be contagious. RT-PCR in urine might be a useful supplement in screening when the RT-PCR is negative in throat swabs.

Clinical and Epidemiological Characteristics of Patients Diagnosed with Covid-19 in a Tertiary Care Center in Mexico City: a Prospective Cohort Study

Background: Regional information regarding the characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 is needed for a better understanding of the pandemic. Objective: The objective of the study to describe the clinical features of COVID-19 patients diagnosed in a tertiary-care center in Mexico City and to assess differences according to the treatment setting (ambulatory vs. hospital) and to the need of intensive care (IC). Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort, including consecutive patients with COVID-19 from February 26, 2020 to April 11, 2020. Results: We identified 309 patients (140 inpatients and 169 outpatients). The median age was 43 years (interquartile range, 33-54), 59.2% men, and 18.6% healthcare workers (12.3% from our center). The median body mass index (BMI) was 29.00 kg/m2 and 39.6% had obesity. Compared to outpatients, inpatients were older, had comorbidities, cough, and dyspnea more frequently. Twenty-nine (20.7%) inpatients required treatment in the IC unit (ICU). History of diabetes (type 1 or 2) and abdominal pain were more common in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients. ICU patients had higher BMIs, higher respiratory rates, and lower room-air capillary oxygen saturations. ICU patients showed a more severe inflammatory response as assessed by white blood cell count, neutrophil and platelet count, C-reactive protein, ferritin, procalcitonin, and albumin levels. By the end of the study period, 65 inpatients had been discharged because of improvement, 70 continued hospitalized, and five had died. Conclusions: Patients with comorbidities, either middle-age obese or elderly complaining of fever, cough, or dyspnea, were more likely to be admitted. At admission, patients with diabetes, high BMI, and clinical or laboratory findings consistent with a severe inflammatory state were more likely to require IC.

Following Data as it Crosses Borders During the COVID-19 Pandemic

Data changes the game in terms of how we respond to pandemics. Global data on disease trajectories and the effectiveness and economic impact of different social distancing measures are essential to facilitate effective local responses to pandemics. COVID-19 data flowing across geographic borders are extremely useful to public health professionals for many purposes such as accelerating the pharmaceutical development pipeline, and for making vital decisions about intensive care unit rooms, where to build temporary hospitals, or where to boost supplies of personal protection equipment, ventilators, or diagnostic tests. Sharing data enables quicker dissemination and validation of pharmaceutical innovations, as well as improved knowledge of what prevention and mitigation measures work. Even if physical borders around the globe are closed, it is crucial that data continues to transparently flow across borders to enable a data economy to thrive which will promote global public health through global cooperation and solidarity.

Coexistence of COVID-19 and acute ischemic stroke report of four cases

Coronaviruses are revealed to target the human respiratory system mainly. However, they also have neuro-invasive abilities and might spread from the respiratory system to the central nervous system. Herein, we report four patients with COVID-19 simultaneously diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke. There were four stroke cases with simultaneously diagnosis of Covid-19 till the April 14, 2020 in the city of Sakarya, Turkey. They were aged between 45 and 77 years. All four cases were likely to have contracted the virus in Sakarya. The patients had all commonly reported symptoms of Covid-19. Three patients have elevated D-dimer levels, and two of them had high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. They were managed symptomatically for both the infection and the stroke. Our findings suggest that ischemic cerebrovascular diseases may simultaneously develop in the course of Covid-19 independently of the critical disease process. Increased inflammation predicted by CRP and D-dimer levels may play a role in the formation of ischemia. In particular, elder patients with prothrombotic risk factors should also be considered for the signs of cerebrovascular events in addition to infectious symptoms.

Colorblind Algorithms: Racism in the Era of COVID-19

This commentary offers a critique of the recent policy document issued by White et al. (2020) to guide critical care resource (e.g. ventilators) allocation during public health emergencies such as COVID-19. We argue that, if disseminated widely, this criteria would result in a racially inequitable resource distribution in the current COVID-19 crisis. We link the White et al. (2020) resource distribution protocol to other "colorblind" healthcare algorithms that have relied on seemingly objective but fundamentally biased data, thereby reinforcing and exacerbating pre-existing racial health disparities. We suggest a health equity framework to ensure unbiased distribution of critical care resources during COVID-19 and in general practice.

Development and Validation of a Rapid, Single-Step Reverse Transcriptase Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) System Potentially to Be Used for Reliable and High-Throughput Screening of COVID-19

Objectives: Development and validation of a single-step and accurate reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification technique (RT-LAMP) for rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 relative to commercial quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays to allow prompt initiation of proper medical care and containment of virus spread. Methods: Primers showing optimal in-silico features were subjected to analytical sensitivity and specificity to assess the limit of detection (LOD) and cross-reaction with closely- and distantly-related viral species, and clinically prominent bacterial and fungal species. In order to evaluate the clinical utility, our RT-LAMP was subjected to a large number of clinical samples, including 213 negative and 47 positive patients, relative to two commercial quantitative RT-PCR assays. Results: The analytical specificity and sensitivity of our assay was 100% and 500 copies/ml when serial dilution was performed in both water and sputum. Subjecting our RT-LAMP assay to clinical samples showed a high degree of specificity (99.5%), sensitivity (91.4%), positive predictive value (97.7%), and negative predictive value (98.1%) when used relative to qRT-PCR. Our RT-LAMP assay was two times faster than qRT-PCR and is storable at room temperature. A suspected case that later became positive tested positive using both our RT-LAMP and the two qRT-PCR assays, which shows the capability of our assay for screening purposes. Conclusions: We present a rapid RT-LAMP assay that could extend the capacity of laboratories to process two times more clinical samples relative to qRT-PCR and potentially could be used for high-throughput screening purposes when demand is increasing at critical situations.

An orally bioavailable broad-spectrum antiviral inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in human airway epithelial cell cultures and multiple coronaviruses in mice

Coronaviruses (CoVs) traffic frequently between species resulting in novel disease outbreaks, most recently exemplified by the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Here, we show that the ribonucleoside analog ß-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC; EIDD-1931) has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and related zoonotic group 2b or 2c bat-CoVs, as well as increased potency against a CoV bearing resistance mutations to the nucleoside analog inhibitor remdesivir. In mice infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, both prophylactic and therapeutic administration of EIDD-2801, an orally bioavailable NHC prodrug (ß-d-N4-hydroxycytidine-5'-isopropyl ester), improved pulmonary function and reduced virus titer and body weight loss. Decreased MERS-CoV yields in vitro and in vivo were associated with increased transition mutation frequency in viral, but not host cell RNA, supporting a mechanism of lethal mutagenesis in CoV. The potency of NHC/EIDD-2801 against multiple CoVs and oral bioavailability highlights its potential utility as an effective antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 and other future zoonotic CoVs.

Implementing an emotional support and mental health response plan for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic

Institutions across the world are working to develop initiatives aimed at supporting the well-being of healthcare workers (HCWs) facing the psychological impacts of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This Commentary identifies risks that HCWs are experiencing, reviews sources of fear and stress, and describes the implementation of a three-tiered model for the provision of emotional support and mental health services for clinical and nonclinical HCWs. The model recognizes the fluid, ever-evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and includes proactive, visible, and easy-to-access supportive psychological services that expand the safety net and help address immediate and future mental health challenges of HCWs.

Clinical features and treatment of COVID-19 patients in northeast Chongqing

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China (SARS-CoV-2) that began in December 2019 presents a significant and urgent threat to global health. This study was conducted to provide the international community with a deeper understanding of this new infectious disease. Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and analyzed in this study. A total of 135 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36-55), and there was no significant gender difference (53.3% men). The majority of patients had contact with people from the Wuhan area. Forty-three (31.9%) patients had underlying disease, primarily hypertension (13 [9.6%]), diabetes (12 [8.9%]), cardiovascular disease (7 [5.2%]), and malignancy (4 [3.0%]). Common symptoms included fever (120 [88.9%]), cough (102 [76.5%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5%]). Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all the patients. All patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%]) (Kaletra and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]), and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]). In addition, many patients received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (124 [91.8%]). It is suggested that patients should receive Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of Western and Chinese medicines. Compared to the mild cases, the severe ones had lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, PCT, ALB, C-reactive protein, and aspartate aminotransferase. This study demonstrates the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID-19 patients. Kaletra and TCM played an important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia. Further studies are required to explore the role of Kaletra and TCM in the treatment of COVID-19.

[Technologies and requirements of protection and disinfection in key places during the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) outbreak]

Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), a new respiratory infectious disease, has become an important public health problem. Inappropriate protection and disinfection measures are potential risk factors of transmission and outbreak of NCP in key places. This theme issue is concerned with the prevention and control of NCP. Comprehensive measures and suggestions for protection and disinfection are put forward from perspectives of functional areas in key places, such as hotels, mobile cabin hospitals, passenger transport stations and public transport facilities, environment and facilities, personal protection, operation management system, etc., so as to provide technical support for the prevention and control of new respiratory infectious diseases.

Dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity and seroprevalence among high-risk health care workers and hospital staff

Staff members from Covid-19 highly exposed units were invited to participate in a six month study of SARS-CoV-2 carriage and seroprevalence. The results of Day 1 and Day 15 visits show that 41 SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by RT-PCR and/or serology in 326 participants (overall infection rate=12.6%). Having co-morbidity or symptoms at the time of collection was a risk factor for infection but not working as a physician/nurse. This universal screening in high-risk units irrespective of symptoms allowed asymptomatic and potentially contagious infected workers to be self-isolated during 7 days.

Is macrophages heterogeneity important in determining COVID-19 lethality?

COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 has led to the death of thousands of adults worldwide. It is now clear that the hyper-inflammatory response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 plays a major role in disease severity and lethality of the infection. Macrophages are innate immune cells that sense and respond to infections by producing a plethora of inflammatory molecules and by interacting with other inflammatory cells. Therefore, macrophages may be diriment on eliminating pathogens and promoting organ repair. However, macrophages can be a major player of the so called cytokine storm and may be damaging to the tissues. It is believed that macrophage activation syndrome is induced by SARS-CoV to be lethal. Surprisingly and fortunately few children die from COVID-19. For instance, in Italy, out of more than 30.000 deaths for COVID-19, three are children. Therefore, we must wonder why? Are macrophages different in children compared to adults? In my opinion they are different. It has been demonstrated that macrophages populate the lung in three "developmental waves", and it has been suggested that similar waves may be observed in other important organs, such as the heart and kidney. It is most likely that macrophages heterogeneity is involved in determining the severity. There are no doubts that macrophages are important in determining life or death in these patients. Comparing macrophages of children with those of adults with different degrees of disease severity is, therefore, mandatory.

La farmacia hospitalaria en el equipo multidisciplinar de las unidades COVID de hospitalización./ Hospital Pharmacy in the multidisciplinary team of COVID inpatient units

Since the implementation of the Antimicrobial Therapy Optimization Programme, hospital pharmacy specialists have collaborated with infectious disease specialists on a regular basis in most hospitals in Spain. Cooperation between these professionals ensures the integrated management of patients with infectious diseases and the appropriate use of antimicrobials in hospitals. The COVID-19 pandemic forced hospital pharmacists to abruptly suspend all their structured activities and concentrate on the health crisis. Realtime information sharing between different medicine specialties is an effective strategy to generate and maintain treatment protocols adapted to each center, with continuous evidence-based modifications as new publications appear. Hospital pharmacies had to reorganize their activities to respond to the pandemic. On the one side were patients with COVID-19, and on the other were routine hospital pharmacy tasks, with the added difficulty of adapting to individual protection measures. New communication and collaboration strategies were adopted. Protocols were established for the management of COVID-19 patients, with continuous changes; special medications had to be prepared and distributed; circuits were designed for the home- or institution-based care of patients; internal circuits were created to minimize the movements of hospital staff and professionals caring for COVID-19 patients. The most effective antiviral drug and anti inflammatory therapy remains elusive. In this scenario, hospital pharmacists emerge as a key player, as they have a deep understanding of the mechanisms of action of drugs and potential interactions. In a setting where experimental drugs preferably tested in clinical trials are being used, the role of hospital pharmacists in interdisciplinary teams has become essential for the optimization of clinical outcomes.

Comparison of clinical and epidemiological characteristics of asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection: A multi-center study in Sichuan Province, China

OBJECTIVES: Asymptomatic infection of SARS-CoV-2 has become a concern worldwide. This study aims to compare the epidemiology and the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. METHODS: A total of 511 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection cases, including 100 asymptomatic (by the time of the pathogenic tests) and 411 symptomatic individuals were consecutively enrolled from January 25 to February 20, 2020 from hospitals in 21 cities and 47 counties or districts in Sichuan Province. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics were compared. RESULTS: Compared to the symptomatic patients, the asymptomatic cases were younger (P < 0.001), had similar co-morbidity percentages (P = 0.609), and came from higher altitude areas with lower population mobility (P < 0.001) with better defined epidemiological history (P < 0.001). 27.4% of well-documented asymptomatic cases developed delayed symptoms after the pathogenic diagnosis. 60% of asymptomatic cases demonstrated findings of pneumonia on the initial chest CT, including well-recognized features of coronavirus disease-19. None of the asymptomatic individuals died. Two elderly individuals with initially asymptomatic infection developed severe symptoms during hospitalization. One case of possible virus transmission by a patient during the incubation period was highly suspected. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological and clinical findings highlight the significance of asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2. Inspecting the epidemiological history would facilitate the identification of asymptomatic cases. Evidence supports the chest CT scans for confirmed asymptomatic cases to evaluate the extent of lung involvement.

[Visualization analysis on treatment of coronavirus based on knowledge graph]

OBJECTIVE: To discuss the research progress in the field of coronavirus (CoVs) treatment based on the visualization analysis of knowledge graph. METHODS: The related literatures in the field of CoVs treatment were retrieved from the establishment of Web of Science core collection database to February 15th, 2020, and the literature analysis tool of Web of Science database was used to count the annual trend of published literatures. The VOSviewer software was used to analyze the relationship among countries, institutions, authors, clustering and density of subject words. The HistCite software was used to screen important documents and to draw the evolution process of hot spots. The CiteSpace software was used to analyze the breakout points of subject words, so as to find the front and hot spots in this field. RESULTS: A total of 1 747 data were retrieved, with the exception of 17 duplicate data, and 1 730 data were retained for visualization analysis. In terms of literature volume, the literatures on CoVs therapy rose after 2003 and 2012, and the number of published literatures had remained high since 2014. In terms of countries, the main countries that carried out the research on the treatment of CoVs were the United States (n = 613), China (n = 582), Germany (n = 122), Canada (n = 99), etc., and the cooperation among countries was close. In terms of institutions, the number of papers issued by Chinese Academy of Sciences in the field of CoVs treatment ranked first (n = 82), followed by University of Hong Kong of China (n = 74) and Chinese University of Hong Kong of China (n = 58), followed by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (n = 37), and the cooperation among various institutions was close. In terms of literature authors, there were two high-yielding authors in the United States [Ralph S. Baric (n = 21) and Kuochen Chou (n = 17)], two Chinese authors [Yuen Kwok-yung (n = 17) and Jiang Shibo (n = 16)] and one Dutch author [Eric J. Snijder (n = 17)]. In terms of the cluster analysis of authors, the authors were closely related in reverse genetics, respiratory infection, receptor binding domain, etc., and the 15 top-cited papers came mainly from China, the United States, Netherlands and other countries, and the literature content represented the frontiers and hot spots in different periods. The treatment hot spots focused on preventing virus adsorption, inhibiting the virus gene nucleic acid replication, transcription and translation. The main subject words were divided into three main categories, namely, CoVs epidemiology, basic research and drug development, in which basic research and drug development were strongly correlated. In the subject words breakthrough analysis, there were time-related breakthrough points in 1991, 1996 and 2002, and the "diagnosis" and "sequence" were continuous hot spots. CONCLUSIONS: Through the visualization analysis of knowledge graph, the development trend and hot spots of CoVs therapy research could be well observed. In this study, the degree of attention in the field of CoVs treatment showed periodic changes, related to the outbreak of new CoVs, and the country, institutions and the author were closely related. The treatment hot spots focused on preventing virus adsorption, inhibiting the virus gene nucleic acid replication, transcription and translation in order to develop new targets of drug.

A Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-based Platform to Study SARS-CoV-2 Tropism and Model Virus Infection in Human Cells and Organoids

SARS-CoV-2 has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need for physiological models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection using human disease-relevant cells. COVID-19 pathophysiology includes respiratory failure but involves other organ systems including gut, liver, heart, and pancreas. We present an experimental platform comprised of cell and organoid derivatives from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). A Spike-enabled pseudo-entry virus infects pancreatic endocrine cells, liver organoids, cardiomyocytes, and dopaminergic neurons. Recent clinical studies show a strong association with COVID-19 and diabetes. We find that human pancreatic beta cells and liver organoids are highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, further validated using adult primary human islets and adult hepatocyte and cholangiocyte organoids. SARS-CoV-2 infection caused striking expression of chemokines, as also seen in primary human COVID-19 pulmonary autopsy samples. hPSC-derived cells/organoids provide valuable models for understanding the cellular responses of human tissues to SARS-CoV-2 infection and for disease modeling of COVID-19.

[Anosmia and COVID-19]

Anosmia associated or not with dysgeusia seems to be a frequent symptom in cases of infection with SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19 It can be the initial symptom of the disease or remain isolated in pauci-symptomatic patients Waiting for scientific confirmation and in the context of the current pandemic, it seems essential to consider any patient with a new anosmia as being infected with SARS-CoV-2 until proven otherwise These patients should therefore isolate themselves and remain alert to the occurrence of other symptoms suggestive of the infection and/or be tested Topical and systemic corticosteroids and nose washes are contraindicated The natural course of anosmia seems to be favorable in most cases

In situ detection of SARS-CoV-2 in lungs and airways of patients with COVID-19

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global public health crisis. In elderly individuals and those with comorbidities, COVID-19 is associated with high mortality, frequently caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome. We examine in situ expression of SARS-CoV-2 in airways and lung obtained at autopsy of individuals with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Seven autopsy cases (male, N = 5; female, N = 2) with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and a median age of 66 years (range, 50-77 years) were evaluated using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against SARS Nucleocapsid protein in correlation with clinical parameters. The median time from symptom onset to death was 9 days (range, 6-31 days), from hospitalization 7 days (range, 1-21 days), from positive RT-PCR 7 days (range, 0-18 days), and from intensive care unit admission defining onset of respiratory failure 3 days (range, 1-18 days). Chest imaging identified diffuse airspace disease in all patients corresponding to acute and (N = 5) or organizing (N = 2) diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) on histologic examination. Among five patients with acute-phase DAD (&#8804;7 days from onset of respiratory failure), SARS-CoV-2 was detected in pulmonary pneumocytes and ciliated airway cells (N = 5), and in upper airway epithelium (N = 2). In two patients with organizing DAD (>14 days from onset of respiratory failure), no virus was detected in lungs or airways. No endothelial cell infection was observed. The findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells in lungs and airways of patients with COVID-19 who developed respiratory failure can be detected during the acute phase of lung injury and is absent in the organizing phase.

Does High Cardiorespiratory Fitness Confer Some Protection Against Proinflammatory Responses After Infection by SARS-CoV-2?

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated in China in late 2019 and has since spread rapidly to every continent in the world. This pandemic continues to cause widespread personal suffering, along with severe pressure on medical and health care providers. The symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent prognosis are worsened in individuals who have preexisting comorbidities prior to infection by the virus. Individuals with obesity or overweight, insulin resistance, and diabetes typically have chronic low-grade inflammation characterized by increased levels of several proinflammatory cytokines and the inflammasome; this state predisposes to greater risk for infection along with more adverse outcomes. Here, we consider whether a high level of cardiorespiratory fitness induced by prior exercise training may confer some innate immune protection against COVID-19 by attenuating the "cytokine storm syndrome" often experienced by "at risk" individuals.

Tracking COVID-19 using online search

Research outcomes over the years have showcased the capacity of online search behaviour to model various properties of infectious diseases. In this work we use online search query frequency time series to gain insights about the prevalence of COVID-19 in multiple countries. We first develop unsupervised modelling techniques based on identified symptom categories by United Kingdom's National Health Service. We then propose ways for minimising an expected bias in these signals partially generated by the early and continuous exposure to news media. We also look into transfer learning techniques for mapping supervised models from countries where the disease spread has progressed to countries that are in earlier phases of the epidemic curve. Furthermore, we analyse the time series of online search queries in relation to confirmed COVID-19 cases data jointly across multiple countries, uncovering interesting patterns. Finally, we show results from short-term forecasting models based on Gaussian Processes that combine confirmed cases and online search data time series.

Retrospective Description of Pregnant Women Infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, France

Little data are available on the management of pregnant women infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We conducted a retrospective study of 100 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in 4 obstetric units in the Paris metropolitan area of France during March 12-April 13, 2020. Among patients, 52 (52%) were hospitalized, 10 (10%) in intensive care units (ICUs). Women with higher body mass indexes (BMIs; median 30.7 kg/m2) were more likely to be hospitalized in ICUs than other women (median BMI 26.2 kg/m2). Women hospitalized in ICUs had lower lymphocyte count at diagnosis (median 0.77 × 109 cells/L) than women not hospitalized in ICUs (median lymphocyte count 1.15 × 109 cells/L). All women requiring oxygen >5 L/min were intubated. Clinical and laboratory evaluation of SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women at the time of diagnosis can identify patients at risk for ICU hospitalization.

Strategies to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic

The World Health Organization declared a COVID-19 pandemic on March 11, 2020, when there were 4,293 confirmed cumulative deaths. By May 17, 2020 this number increased to 315,005. The risk of death is higher above the age of 60, but there are many deaths below 60 (for example, in Sao Paulo, 25%). Due to the lack of a vaccine or specific treatment, there are at least three types of interventions used in the first wave of this pandemic: increased alertness and hygiene (e.g. Sweden); identification and isolation of infected people and their contacts (e.g. South Korea); lockdown (e.g. Italy). These interventions are complementary. Choices of the right mix of interventions will vary from society to society and in the same society at different times. The search for a miracle drug is dangerous because it is based on the mistaken belief that any treatment option is better than "nothing". Brazilian society will not be able to maintain lockdown for a long period. Naturally, in the near future, regardless of the advice from scientists, doctors and authorities, commerce, services and schools will reopen. In order to implement any strategy aimed to control the pandemic and preserve the economy, the country needs leadership that centralizes and coordinates actions. Unfortunately, the Brazilian government is not fulfilling this role; on the contrary, it is a hindrance. This negative leadership and lack of coordination are causing many deaths and are severely damaging the lives of survivors by delaying the resuming of economic and social activities.

Projecting the Course of COVID-19 in Turkey: A Probabilistic Modeling Approach

BACKGROUND/AIM: The COVID-19 Pandemic originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and became one of the worst global health crises ever. While struggling with the unknown nature of this novel coronavirus, many researchers and groups attempted to project the progress of the pandemic using empirical or mechanistic models, each one having its drawbacks. The first confirmed cases were announced early in March, and since then, serious containment measures have taken place in Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we present a different approach, a Bayesian negative binomial multilevel model with mixed effects, for the projection of the COVID-19 pandemic and apply this model to the Turkish case. The model source code is available at https://github.com/kansil/covid-19. We predicted confirmed daily cases and cumulative numbers for June 6th to June 26th with 80%, 95% and 99% prediction intervals (PI). RESULTS: Our projections showed that if we continued to comply with measures and no drastic changes are seen in diagnosis or management protocols, the epidemic curve would tend to decrease in this time interval. Also, the predictive validity analysis suggests that proposed model projections should be in the 95% PI band for the first 12 days of the projections. CONCLUSION: We expect that drastic changes in the course of the COVID-19 in Turkey will cause the model to suffer in predictive validity, and this can be used to monitor the epidemic. We hope that the discussion on these projections and the limitations of the epidemiological forecasting will be beneficial to the medical community, and policy-makers.

Economic stress, emotional contagion and safety outcomes: A cross-country study

BACKGROUND: Economic instability produced by financial crises can increase employment-related (i.e., job insecurity) and income-related (i.e., financial stress) economic stress. While the detrimental impact of job insecurity on safety outcomes has been extensively investigated, no study has examined the concurrent role of financial stress let alone their emotion-related predictors. OBJECTIVE: The present cross-country research sought to identify the simultaneous effects of affective job insecurity and financial stress in predicting employee safety injuries and accidents under-reporting, and to examine the extent to which emotional contagion of positive/negative emotions at work contribute to the level of experienced economic stress. METHODS: We performed multi-group measurement and structural invariance analyses. RESULTS: Data from employees in the U.S. (Nâ=â498) and Italy (Nâ=â366) suggest that financial stress is the primary mediator between emotional contagion and poor safety outcomes. Moreover, greater anger-contagion predicted higher levels of financial strain and job insecurity whereas greater joy-contagion predicted reduced economic stress. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the relevance of considering the concurrent role of income-and employment-related stressors as predictors of safety-related outcomes. Theoretical and practical implications for safety are discussed in light of the globally increasing emotional pressure and concerns of income- and employment-related economic stress in today's workplace, particularly given the recent pandemic spread of Corona virus disease (COVID-19).

Commentary: Challenges for PhD students during COVID-19 pandemic: Turning crisis into an opportunity

COVID-19 results in the suspension of life all over the world. Universities suspended their academic activities except for online courses for undergrad and grad students. However, PhD students in both biochemistry and molecular biology fields must hold their experiments at the laboratories. Even under these extreme circumstances, the academic journey of a master's or PhD student should not be stopped; on contrary, they need to use these times to improve their knowledge related to their fields. Therefore, they can turn this COVID-19 crisis into an opportunity for themselves.

A reproduction rate which perfectly fits Covid-19

We present a simple technique to compare the development of the Covid-19 epidemic in different regions, based only on the time series of confirmed cases. Weekly new infections, taken for every day, are interpreted as infection potential of Covid-19. We derive a robust time-varying reproduction rate for the infection potential, including asymptomatic cases, which does not depend on death rate or testing intensity. It requires few assumptions and shows a more plausible time course than official reproduction rates in several countries.

Doing Our Part to Conserve Resources: Determining Whether All Personal Protective Equipment Is Mandatory for Closed Reduction and Percutaneous Pinning of Supracondylar Humeral Fractures

BACKGROUND: Closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (CRPP) of supracondylar humeral fractures is one of the most common procedures performed in pediatric orthopaedics. The use of full, standard preparation and draping with standard personal protective equipment (PPE) may not be necessary during this procedure. This is of particular interest in the current climate as we face unprecedented PPE shortages due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of 1,270 patients treated with CRPP of a supracondylar humeral fracture at 2 metropolitan pediatric centers by 10 fellowship-trained pediatric orthopaedic surgeons. One surgeon in the group did not wear a mask when performing CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures, and multiple surgeons in the group utilized a semisterile preparation technique (no sterile gown or drapes). Infectious outcomes were compared between 2 groups: full sterile preparation and semisterile preparation. We additionally analyzed a subgroup of patients who had semisterile preparation without surgeon mask use. Hospital cost data were used to estimate annual cost savings with the adoption of the semisterile technique. RESULTS: In this study, 1,270 patients who underwent CRPP of a supracondylar humeral fracture and met inclusion criteria were identified. There were 3 deep infections (0.24%). These infections all occurred in the group using full sterile preparation and surgical masks. No clinically relevant pin-track infections were noted. There were no known surgeon occupational exposures to bodily fluid. It is estimated that national adoption of this technique in the United States could save between 18,612 and 22,162 gowns and masks with costs savings of $3.7 million to $4.4 million annually. CONCLUSIONS: We currently face critical shortages of PPE due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from this large series suggest that a semisterile technique during CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures is a safe practice. We anticipate that this could preserve approximately 20,000 gowns and masks in the United States over the next year. Physicians are encouraged to reevaluate their daily practice to identify safe opportunities for resource preservation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

Linking aerosol characteristics of size distributions, core potential pathogens and toxic metal(loid)s to wastewater treatment process

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) play important roles in water purification but are also important source of aerosols. However, the relationship between aerosol characteristics and wastewater treatment process remains poorly understood. In this study, aerosols were collected over a 24-month period from a WWTP using a modified anaerobic-anoxic-oxic process. The aerated tank (AerT) was characterized by the highest respiratory fraction (RF) concentrations (861-1525 CFU/m3) and proportions (50.76%-65.96%) of aerosol particles. Fourteen core potential pathogens and 15 toxic metal(loid)s were identified in aerosols. Mycobacterium was the genus that aerosolized most easily in fine grid, pre-anoxic tank, and AerT. High wastewater treatment efficiency may increase the emission of RF and core potential pathogens. The median size of activated sludge, richness of core potential pathogens in wastewater, and total suspended particulates were the most influential factors directly related to the RF proportions, core community of potential pathogens, and composition of toxic metal(loid)s in WWTP aerosols, respectively. Relative humidity, temperature, input and removal of biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, and mixed liquor suspended solids could also directly or indirectly affect the aerosol characteristics. This study enhances the mechanistic understanding of linking aerosol characteristics to treatment processes and has important implications for targeted manipulation.

SARS-CoV-2 infection risk assessment in the endometrium: viral infection-related gene expression across the menstrual cycle

OBJECTIVE: To determine the susceptibility of the endometrium to infection by-and thereby potential damage from-SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN: Analysis of SARS-Cov-2 infection-related gene expression from endometrial transcriptomic data sets. SETTING: Infertility research department affiliated with a public hospital. PATIENT(S): Gene expression data from five studies in 112 patients with normal endometrium collected throughout the menstrual cycle. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Gene expression and correlation between viral infectivity genes and age throughout the menstrual cycle. RESULT(S): Gene expression was high for TMPRSS4, CTSL, CTSB, FURIN, MX1, and BSG; medium for TMPRSS2; and low for ACE2. ACE2, TMPRSS4, CTSB, CTSL, and MX1 expression increased toward the window of implantation. TMPRSS4 expression was positively correlated with ACE2, CTSB, CTSL, MX1, and FURIN during several cycle phases; TMPRSS2 was not statistically significantly altered across the cycle. ACE2, TMPRSS4, CTSB, CTSL, BSG, and MX1 expression increased with age, especially in early phases of the cycle. CONCLUSION(S): Endometrial tissue is likely safe from SARS-CoV-2 cell entry based on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression, but susceptibility increases with age. Further, TMPRSS4, along with BSG-mediated viral entry into cells, could imply a susceptible environment for SARS-CoV-2 entry via different mechanisms. Additional studies are warranted to determine the true risk of endometrial infection by SARS-CoV-2 and implications for fertility treatments.

Reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with severe COVID-19 disease by advancing ongoing trials of Mesenchymal Stromal (stem) Cell (MSC) therapy - Achieving global consensus and visibility for cellular host-directed therapies

As of May 17th 2020, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused 307,395 deaths worldwide, out of 3,917,366 cases reported to the World Health Organization. No specific treatments for reducing mortality or morbidity are yet available. Deaths from COVID-19 will continue to rise globally until effective and appropriate treatments and/or vaccines are found. In search of effective treatments, the global medical, scientific, pharma and funding communities have rapidly initiated over 500 COVID-19 clinical trials on a range of antiviral drug regimens and repurposed drugs in various combinations. A paradigm shift is underway from the current focus of drug development targeting the pathogen, to advancing cellular Host-Directed Therapies (HDTs) for tackling the aberrant host immune and inflammatory responses which underlie the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and high COVID-19 mortality rates. We focus this editorial specifically on the background to, and the rationale for, the use and evaluation of mesenchymal stromal (Stem) cells (MSCs) in treatment trials of patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Currently, the ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) report a combined 28 trials exploring the potential of MSCs or their products for treatment of COVID-19. MSCs should also be trialed for treatment of other circulating WHO priority Blueprint pathogens such as MERS-CoV which causes upto 34% mortality rates. It's about time funding agencies invested more into development MSCs per se, and also for a range of other HDTs, in combination with other therapeutic interventions. MSC therapy could turn out to be an important contribution to bringing an end to the high COVID-19 death rates and preventing long-term functional disability in those who survive disease.

In the midst of the perfect storm: swift public health actions needed in order to increase societal safety during the COVID-19 pandemic

The phenomenal speed of COVID-19 has subjected the public health professionals worldwide to struggle to subdue the spread of the disease and its impact of the affected societies. The limited biomedical and epidemiological understanding of COVID-19 along with the lack of vaccines and therapeutics have led to the reception of draconian measures from the societal safety domain, limiting human interaction through social distancing. Grounded on the adopted approaches, interventions in sero-prevalence studies, mobilisation of the primary health care (PHC) sector, as well as target socially vulnerable groups should be taken into consideration by heath authorities.

Alert for non-respiratory symptoms of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in epidemic period: A case report of familial cluster with three asymptomatic COVID-19 patients

At present, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rampaging around the world. However, asymptomatic carriers intensified the difficulty of prevention and management. Here we reported the screening, clinical feathers, and treatment process of a family cluster involving three COVID-19 patients. The discovery of the first asymptomatic carrier in this family cluster depends on the repeated and comprehensive epidemiological investigation by disease control experts. In addition, the combination of multiple detection methods can help clinicians find asymptomatic carriers as early as possible. In conclusion, the prevention and control experience of this family cluster showed that comprehensive rigorous epidemiological investigation and combination of multiple detection methods were of great value for the detection of hidden asymptomatic carriers.

Selection of viral variants during persistent infection of insectivorous bat cells with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus

Coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are speculated to have originated in bats. The mechanisms by which these viruses are maintained in individuals or populations of reservoir bats remain an enigma. Mathematical models have predicted long-term persistent infection with low levels of periodic shedding as a likely route for virus maintenance and spillover from bats. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bat cells and MERS coronavirus (CoV) can co-exist in vitro. To test our hypothesis, we established a long-term coronavirus infection model of bat cells that are persistently infected with MERS-CoV. We infected cells from Eptesicus fuscus with MERS-CoV and maintained them in culture for at least 126 days. We characterized the persistently infected cells by detecting virus particles, protein and transcripts. Basal levels of type I interferon in the long-term infected bat cells were higher, relative to uninfected cells, and disrupting the interferon response in persistently infected bat cells increased virus replication. By sequencing the whole genome of MERS-CoV from persistently infected bat cells, we identified that bat cells repeatedly selected for viral variants that contained mutations in the viral open reading frame 5 (ORF5) protein. Furthermore, bat cells that were persistently infected with &#916;ORF5 MERS-CoV were resistant to superinfection by wildtype virus, likely due to reduced levels of the virus receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and higher basal levels of interferon in these cells. In summary, our study provides evidence for a model of coronavirus persistence in bats, along with the establishment of a unique persistently infected cell culture model to study MERS-CoV-bat interactions.

Alcohol Consumption Reported during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Initial Stage

Physical health is not the only area affected by the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic. There are also other consequences that have globally affected many millions at other levels, namely: Societal, political, economic, and cultural. This study aims to survey alcohol drinking throughout the pandemic so as to investigate those factors considered most relevant; i.e., sociodemographic and clinical. A longitudinal study was designed. The first (or initial) stage was completed between April 10-20 2020 on 443 subjects during the enforcement of the "Lockdown" in Poland. The second stage will be due in June 2020. As well as an in-house questionnaire, the study used: The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and the Brief COPE Inventory (Mini COPE). Alcohol was the most commonly used psychoactive substance (73%) identified. More than 30% changed their drinking habits because of the pandemic, with 16% actually drinking less, whilst 14% did so more. The former group was significantly younger than the latter. Amongst the stress-related coping strategies, it was found that current alcohol drinkers were significantly less able to find anything positive about the pandemic situation (positive reframing) and were mentally less able to cope. Those drinking more now were found to have been drinking more intensively before the pandemic started.

COVID-19 pandemic: A review based on current evidence

In December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, a novel coronavirus, initiated an outbreak of pneumonia from Wuhan in China, which rapidly spread worldwide. The clinical characteristics of the disease range from asymptomatic cases or mild symptoms, which include nonspecific symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, headache, and nasal congestion to severe cases such as pneumonia, respiratory failure demanding mechanical ventilation to multi-organ failure, sepsis, and death. As the transmission rate is quite alarming, we require an effective therapeutic strategy to treat symptomatic patients and adopt the preventive measures in order to contain the infection and prevent community transmission. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a public health emergency of international concern, hence repurposing of the drugs is an attractive and a feasible option because PK/PD profile, toxicity profile, and drug interactions are already known. This review emphasizes on the different aspects of COVID-19 such as the epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, and preventive measures to be adopted in order to fight this pandemic. It also highlights upon the ethics preparedness and challenges faced by a developing country like India during such an outbreak. The review focuses on the various approaches adopted till date for developing effective therapeutic strategies including combination of drugs, vaccine therapy, and convalescent plasma therapy to combat this viral outbreak.

Characteristics of personal protective equipment training programs in Australia and New Zealand hospitals: A survey

BACKGROUND: Using personal protective equipment (PPE) is one of several fundamental measures to prevent the transmission of infection and infectious diseases and is particularly pertinent in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate use of PPE by healthcare workers is, however, often suboptimal. Training and monitoring of PPE competency are essential components of an infection prevention and control program but there is a paucity of research and data on the content of such training programs across Australasia. This paper reports the results of a survey that characterised the nature of PPE training in Australian and New Zealand hospitals. METHODS: A population-based online survey was distributed to members of three major Australasian colleges representing infection prevention and control. RESULTS: Results indicate that, although training is frequently provided at orientation, many healthcare workers do not receive regular updates. Training programmes combine online and classroom sessions, but over a third do not include a practical component. The frequency of monitoring PPE competency is variable with one third of respondents indicating that no auditing occurs. PPE items used for high-level training are variable, with use of powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) uncommon. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that HCWs' confidence, competence and familiarity with PPE are a concern, which in the context of the current global COVID-19 pandemic is problematic. More research is needed into how PPE training programs could be better designed, to prepare HCWs for practice using PPE safely and confidently.

Optimizing Peripandemic Care for Veteran Major Non-Traumatic Lower Extremity Amputees: A Proposal Informed by a National Retrospective Descriptive Analysis of COVID-19 Risk Factor Prevalence

INTRODUCTION: In response to the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, vascular surgeons in the Veteran Affairs Health Care System have been undertaking only essential cases, such as advanced critical limb ischemia. Surgical risk assessment in these patients is often complex, considers all factors known to impact short- and long-term outcomes, and the additional risk that COVID-19 infection could convey in this patient population is unknown. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) published risk factors (ECDC-RF) implicated in increased COVID-19 hospitalization and case-fatality which have been further evidenced by initial reports from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC reports additionally indicate that African American (AA) patients have incurred disparate infection outcomes in the United States. We set forth to survey the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) database over a nearly 20 year span to inform ongoing risk assessment with an estimation of the prevalence of ECDC-RF in our veteran critical limb ischemia population and investigate whether an increased COVID-19 comorbidity burden exists for AA veterans presenting for major non-traumatic amputation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The VASQIP database was queried for all above knee amputation (AKA) and below knee amputation (BKA) completed 1999-2018 after IRB approval (MIRB:#02507). Patient race and ECDC-RF including male gender, age > 60 years, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disease were recorded from preoperative patient history. AKA and BKA cohorts were compared via &#967;2-test with Yates correction or unpaired t-test and a subgroup analysis was conducted between AA and all other race patients for COVID-19 comorbidities in each cohort. RESULTS: VASQIP query returned 50,083 total entries. Average age was 65.1 ± 10.4 years and 68.2 ± 10.5 years for BKA and AKA cohorts, respectively, (P < .0001) and nearly all patients were male (99%). At least one ECDC-RF comorbidity was present in 25,526 (88.7%) of BKA and 17,558 (82.4%) of AKA patients (P < .0001). AA BKA patients were significantly more likely than non-AA BKA patients to present with at least one ECDC-RF comorbidity (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: According to a large national Veterans Affairs database, there are high rates of ECDC-RF in veteran amputees. During the present crisis, management of these patients should incorporate telehealth, expedient discharge, and ongoing COVID-19 transmission precautions.

(Vi)-rushed Into Online Group Schema Therapy Based Day-Treatment for Older Adults by the COVID-19 Outbreak in the Netherlands

BACKGROUND: Societal measures in context of the COVID-19 outbreak forced us to transform our schema therapy based day-treatment for older adults with chronic affective disorders and personality problems into an online program. The objective of this paper is to present first impressions of this transformation. METHODS: Using over-the-phone instructions initially, all patients were able to participate with the online therapy program. To reduce screen-time for patients, the nonverbal therapies were shortened. Four patients, aged 64-70 years, started our online program. RESULTS: Therapists were positive about the online capabilities and resilience of patients to adapt to the new situation. Prejudices on limited effectiveness of online psychotherapy were counteracted. Sending homework by email and mail seems to facilitate therapy adherence. Nonverbal therapy could be important to stimulate the online group process. CONCLUSION: We were positively surprised by the online capabilities of our geriatric mental healthcare patients and encourage further formal effectiveness studies.

Predicting inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase using machine learning and virtual screening

Global coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) caused by newly identified SARS- CoV-2 coronavirus continues to claim the lives of thousands of people worldwide. The unavailability of specific medications to treat COVID-19 has led to drug repositioning efforts using various approaches, including computational analyses. Such analyses mostly rely on molecular docking and require the 3D structure of the target protein to be available. In this study, we utilized a set of machine learning algorithms and trained them on a dataset of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors to run inference analyses on antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs solely based on the ligand information. We also performed virtual screening analysis of the drug candidates predicted by machine learning models and docked them against the active site of SARS- CoV-2 RdRp, a key component of the virus replication machinery. Based on the ligand information of RdRp inhibitors, the machine learning models were able to identify candidates such as remdesivir and baloxavir marboxil, molecules with documented activity against RdRp of the novel coronavirus. Among the other identified drug candidates were beclabuvir, a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RdRp enzyme, and HCV protease inhibitors paritaprevir and faldaprevir. Further analysis of these candidates using molecular docking against the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp revealed low binding energies against the enzyme active site. Our approach also identified anti-inflammatory drugs lupeol, lifitegrast, antrafenine, betulinic acid, and ursolic acid to have potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. We propose that the results of this study are considered for further validation as potential therapeutic options against COVID-19.

Inpatient teledermatology during the COVID-19 pandemic

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a global health crisis in which personal protective equipment has become increasingly limited. Dermatologists are poised to use technology, such as teledermatology, to innovate existing workflows and optimize dermatologic care. The state of Ohio has emerged as a leader in the United States with its response to the COVID-19 crisis. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, we developed a simple algorithm and strict guidelines to prioritize telemedicine specifically for inpatient dermatology consults. This algorithm was quickly accepted by our hospital leadership and adopted by other inpatient consultative services. In this Viewpoint, we share our experience with early adoption of teledermatology in the inpatient consultative setting in light of the COVID-19 crisis. We also highlight the limitations, ethical considerations, and areas for future research with respect to the implementation of teledermatology.

Delivering healthcare remotely to cardiovascular patients during COVID-19: A rapid review of the evidence

BACKGROUND: Although attention is focused on addressing the acute situation created by the COVID-19 illness, it is imperative to continue our efforts to prevent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly during a period of prolonged social isolation which may limit physical activity, adversely affect mental health and reduce access to usual care. One option may be to deliver healthcare interventions remotely through digital healthcare solutions. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to bring together the evidence for remote healthcare during a quarantine situation period to support people living with cardiovascular disease during COVID-19 isolation. METHODS: The PubMed, CINAHL and Google Scholar were searched using telehealth OR digital health OR mHealth OR eHealth OR mobile apps AND COVID-19 OR quarantine search terms. We also searched for literature relating to cardiovascular disease AND quarantine. RESULTS: The literature search identified 45 potentially relevant publications, out of which nine articles were included. Three overarching themes emerged from this review: (1) preparing the workforce and ensuring reimbursement for remote healthcare, (2) supporting mental and physical health and (3) supporting usual care. CONCLUSION: To support people living with cardiovascular disease during COVID-19 isolation and to mitigate the effects of quarantine and adverse effect on mental and physical well-being, we should offer remote healthcare and provide access to their usual care.

''Determining Host Factors Contributing to Disease Severity in a Family Cluster of 29 Hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 Patients: Could Genetic Factors Be Relevant in the Clinical Course of COVID-19?''

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we report a large family cluster consisting of 29 genetically related patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We sought to determine the clinical characteristics relevant to the clinical course of COVID-19 by comparing the family cluster to unrelated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection so that the presence of potential determinants of disease severity, other than traditional risk factors previously reported, could be investigated. METHODS: 29 patient files were investigated in Group 1 and Group 2 was created with 52 consecutive COVID-19 patients with age and gender compatibility. The virus was detected for diagnosis. The clinical, laboratory and imaging features of all patients were retrospectively screened. Disease course was assessed using records regarding outcome from patient files retrospectively. Groups were compared with respect to baseline characteristics, disease severity on presentation, disease course. RESULTS: There was no difference between the two groups in terms of comorbidity and smoking history. In terms of in-hospital treatment, use differed not significantly between two groups. We found that all 29 patients in Group 1 had severe pneumonia, 18 patients had severe pneumonia. Hospitalization rates, length of hospital stay and transferred to ICU were found to be statistically significantly higher in Group 1. CONCLUSION: In the present study, COVID-19 cases in the large family cluster were shown to have more severe disease and worse clinical course compared to consecutive COVID-19 patients presenting to the same time. We believe further studies into potential genetic mechanisms of host susceptibility to COVID-19 should include such family clusters. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Aufgaben der Weaning-Zentren im Pandemiefall COVID-19./ [Responsibilities of Weaning Centers during the COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak - Recommendations for the Assignment of ICU Capacities in COVID-19 Patients as shown by the Berlin-Brandenburg POST-SAVE-Model]

The enormous increase in patients with severe respiratory distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak requires a systematic approach to optimize ventilated patient at risk flow. A standardised algorithm called "SAVE" was developed to distribute patients with COVID-19 respiratory distress syndrome requiring invasive ventilation. This program is established by now in Berlin. An instrumental bottleneck of this approach is the vacant slot assignment in the intensive care unit to guarantee constant patient flow. The transfer of the patients after acute care treatment is needed urgently to facilitate the weaning process. In a next step we developed a triage algorithm to identify patients at SAVE intensive care units with potential to wean and transfer to weaning institutionsâ-âwe called POST SAVE. This manuscript highlights the algorithms including the use of a standardised digital evaluation tool, the use of trained navigators to facilitate the communication between SAVE intensive care units and weaning institutions and the establishment of a prospective data registry for patient assignment and reevaluation of the weaning potential in the future.

Low dose radiation therapy as a potential life saving treatment for COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

The new coronavirus COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was declared a global public health emergency by WHO on Jan 30, 2020. Despite massive efforts from various governmental, health and medical organizations, the disease continues to spread globally with increasing fatality rates. Several experimental drugs have been approved by FDA with unknown efficacy and potential adverse effects. The exponentially spreading pandemic of COVID-19 deserves prime public health attention to evaluate yet unexplored arenas of management. We opine that one of these treatment options is low dose radiation therapy for severe and most critical cases. There is evidence in literature that low dose radiation induces an anti-inflammatory phenotype that can potentially afford therapeutic benefit against COVID-19-related complications that are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Herein, we review the effects and putative mechanisms of low dose radiation that may be viable, useful and of value in counter-acting the acute inflammatory state induced by critical stage COVID-19.

Demographics and clinical presentation of patients with ocular disorders during the COVID-19 lockdown in India: A report

Purpose: The aim of this study is to describe the demographics and clinical profile of patients with ocular disorders presenting during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown in India. Methods: This cross-sectional hospital-based study included patients presenting between March 23, 2020 and April 19, 2020. All patients who presented to the emergency department were included as cases. The data were collected using an electronic medical record system. Results: Overall, 1,192 patients (mean 42.57 per day) presented to the ocular emergency department and were included for analysis. The median age of the patients was 35 (Interquartile range, IQR: 20-52) years and they were mostly adults (77.85%). The majority of patients were male (62.16%) and presented from the local metropolitan region (56.21%). On triaging based on the ocular disorders at presentation, the majority of the patients were emergency related (65.02%), followed by urgent (8.14%) and routine (26.85%) in nature. The most common emergencies were microbial keratitis (23.74%), followed by corneal trauma (16.39%). There was an increasing trend seen in emergency patients (46.11%; week 1 to 71.78%; week 4) and a decreasing trend seen in routine patients (45%; week1 to 21.20%; week 4). A subset of patients (23.49%) underwent surgery where indicated and the most commonly performed procedures were vitreo-retinal procedures (32.86%) followed by trauma related (31.43%). Conclusion: The enforcement of the nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19 resulted in a fewer patients presenting to the hospital. The majority of them presented from the local metropolitan region and the common emergencies were microbial keratitis and corneal trauma. About one fourth required a surgical intervention which was most commonly a vitreo-retinal procedure.

Safe management of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19: a rapid systematic review

INTRODUCTION: Proper strategies to minimise the risk of infection in individuals handling the bodies of deceased persons infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) are urgently needed. The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature to scope and assess the effects of specific strategies for the management of the bodies. METHODS: We searched five general, three Chinese and four coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-specific electronic databases. We searched registries of clinical trials, websites of governmental and other relevant organisations, reference lists of the included papers and relevant systematic reviews, and Epistemonikos for relevant systematic reviews. We included guidance documents providing practical advice on the handling of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Then, we sought primary evidence of any study design reporting on the efficacy and safety of the identified strategies in coronaviruses. We included evidence relevant to contextual factors (ie, acceptability). A single reviewer extracted data using a pilot-tested form and graded the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. A second reviewer verified the data and assessments. RESULTS: We identified one study proposing an uncommon strategy for autopsies for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. The study provided very low-certainty evidence that it reduced the risk of transmission. We identified 23 guidance documents providing practical advice on the steps of handling the bodies: preparation, packing, and others and advice related to both the handling of the dead bodies and the use of personal protective equipment by individuals handling them. We did not identify COVID-19 evidence relevant to any of these steps. CONCLUSION: While a substantive number of guidance documents propose specific strategies, we identified no study providing direct evidence for the effects of any of those strategies. While this review highlights major research gaps, it allows interested entities to build their own guidance.

COVID-19 and Nigeria: putting the realities in context

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was previously known as 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The disease evolved into a serious global emergency, leading to its declaration as a pandemic. DISCUSSION: On the African continent, Nigeria is just experiencing the direct effects of this pandemic, having recorded her index case in February 2020, with an increasing number of cases every day and a current case fatality ratio of 0.03 as at 13 April 2020. Although the recorded cases may seem low, it has been forecast that Africa will have some of the worst effects of this disease by the end of the pandemic. Generally, African countries have fragile health systems and this remains a source of concern, especially in the event of increased outbreaks. Nigeria's current national health systems cannot effectively respond to the growing needs of already infected patients requiring admission into intensive care units for acute respiratory diseases and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS COV-2) pneumonia. This has grim implications for Nigeria, especially as increased cases loom that may require critical care. Provision of quarantine or isolation facilities and availability of rapid diagnostic kits for fast and reliable testing and diagnosis of the disease can also be a challenge in Africa. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need to put into perspective these realities peculiar to Africa including Nigeria and explore available collective measures and interventions to address the COVID-19 pandemic.

Follow-up of skin lesions during the evolution of COVID-19: a case report

The disease caused by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) has many systemic manifestations affecting the upper airways, lungs, gastrointestinal tract and inducing hematological repercussions. With the evolution of the pandemic, skin lesions were observed. However, there is little information about the evolution of the lesions at this moment. The authors report a case of a patient who had more than one exposure to the coronavirus during the evolution of the disease and manifested different types of edematous lesions. The lesions started in the prodromal period and changed their presentation and localization during the evolution of COVID-19. The lesions regressed quickly with the use of corticoid cream and antihistamine. Viral skin lesions are frequent causes of exanthema. However, viral etiology is not always investigated in acute urticarial and atypical erythematous-edematous conditions. The immunological basis of acute urticaria has points in common with COVID-19, justifying the appearance of lesions. Investigation of viral etiology should always be remembered in acute urticarial and edematous conditions.

Less expression of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells might reflect the severity of infection and predict worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19: Evidence from a pooled analysis

This study mainly focused on the very serious COVID-19 epidemic situation at present and provided a new insight for the treatment and monitor of patients with COVID-19. Through this meta-analysis, we could draw a conclusion that less expression of blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cells count might reflect the severity of infection and often accompanied by a poor prognosis. Hence, we inferred blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cells count could be a promising biomarker for disease assessment and monitor of patients with COVID-19.

Dying during Covid-19

I had been on the phone with Madeleine's mother for fifteen minutes, and she had sobbed throughout. She pleaded with me, "You won't even let our family visit her together. If you really want to help my daughter, you will let us stay with her." Madeleine, who was twenty-four years old, was dying of end-stage acute myeloid leukemia and was intubated in one of our intensive care units. Her intensivist had requested a clinical ethics consultation for potentially inappropriate medical treatment-in my world of clinical ethics consultation, routine stuff. Except that, in March 2020, nothing was routine anymore. The Covid-19 pandemic calls for creative thinking about ad hoc and post hoc bereavement efforts, and it may result in efforts to revise existing accounts of what constitutes a good death in order to accommodate patients' and families' experiences at the end of life during a pandemic.

Gestión farmacéutica de la pandemia COVID-19 en un hospital mediano./ Pharmaceutical management of the COVID-19 pandemic in a mid-size hospital

The purpose of this article is to report the experience of the Department of Hospital Pharmacy of a mid-size hospital during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The human and material resources available in a mid-size hospital were more limited than in larger hospitals of the region. In this article, we describe how this Department of Hospital Pharmacy was reorganized to meet the increase in activity, the strategies developed and the lessons learned for future pandemics. The COVID-19 pandemic had a higher impact in Leganes, a city in the south of Madrid, with a population of 190,000. In the face of the dramatic increase in the proportion of patients attending our hospital between March and April 2020, the Severo Ochoa University Hospital increased the number of beds by 24.5% and fitted out new premises inside and outside the hospital (sports centers). The mean number of patients seen in our Emergency Department every day passed from 70-80 to a peak of 286 patients, with 652 hospitalized patients. The situation of emergency created by this infectious disease, with management protocols changing constantly, had a dramatic impact on the activity of hospital pharmacies. Thus, the pandemic has affected areas of economic management, magistral preparation, dispensing of medication to inpatients, ambulatory patients, patients monitored at home, institutionalized patients, and patients from private hospitals and field hospitals. Other areas affected include training, clinical trials, pharmacovigilance, and counseling boards. Two strategies were adopted to overcome these problems: a strategy centered on human resources (staff reinforcement, reallocation of responsibilities), and a strategy centered on processes (some processes were reinforced to meet the increase in activity, whereas other were temporarily suspended or reduced to the minimum).Conclusions: The Department of Hospital Pharmacy plays a key role in hospitals and has been significantly reinforced to meet the dramatic impact of the pandemic on this service. This Department has been able to reorganize its processes and take over new responsibilities such as telepharmacy and home dispensing. Hospital pharmacies play a crucial role in pharmacotherapeutic decisions in hospitals. As in other Departments, training is the area more significantly affected by the pandemic.

Pneumomediastinum following intubation in COVID-19 patients: a case series

The number of patients requiring tracheal intubation rose dramatically in March and April 2020 with the COVID-19 outbreak. Our thoracic surgery department has seen an increased incidence of severe pneumomediastinum referred for surgical opinion in intubated patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis. Here we present a series of five patients with severe pneumomediastinum requiring decompression therapy over a 7-day period in the current COVID-19 outbreak. We hypothesise that the mechanism for this is the aggressive disease pathophysiology with an increased risk of alveolar damage and tracheobronchial injury, along with the use of larger-bore tracheal tubes and higher ventilation pressures. We present this case series in order to highlight the increased risk of this potentially life-threatening complication among the COVID-19 patient cohort and offer guidance for its management to critical care physicians.

Recent outbreak of chilblain-like lesions is not directly related with SARS-CoV-2 infection

Throughout March and April 2020, dermatologists have observed an outbreak of chilblains despite climatic conditions not conducive to their apparition. These lesions have occurred simultaneously to the COVID-19 epidemic, suggesting a relationship between their onset and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we describe a series of 10 patients presenting chilblain-like lesions in whom we have searched for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In vitro testing of combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin on SARS-CoV-2 shows synergistic effect

Human coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2 appeared at the end of 2019 and led to a pandemic with high morbidity and mortality. As there are currently no effective drugs targeting this virus, drug repurposing represents a short-term strategy to treat millions of infected patients at low costs. Hydroxychloroquine showed an antiviral effect in vitro. In vivo it showed efficacy, especially when combined with azithromycin in a preliminary clinical trial. Here we demonstrate that the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has a synergistic effect in vitro on SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations compatible with that obtained in human lung.

In vitro characterization and immunogenicity of chitosan nanoparticles loaded with native and inactivated extracellular proteins from a field strain of Clostridium perfringens associated with necrotic enteritis

There are currently no licensed vaccines against Clostridium perfringens which causes necrotic enteritis in poultry. Chitosan nanoparticles were formulated with native (CN) or toxoids (CT) of extracellular proteins (ECP) of C. perfringens, both surface-tagged with Salmonella flagellar proteins. In a pH stability assay, CN and CT nanoparticles released 6% and 0% of their protein at 8.0 pH. In a protein release assay, CN and CT nanoparticles released 16% and 10% of their protein respectively at 7.4 pH after 24 h. CN and CT nanoparticles incubated at 100 µg/mL PBS with Chicken RBCs released 1% and 0% hemoglobin respectively. Ninety broilers were randomly assigned to treatments; sham-vaccinated (Control), CN-vaccinated (CN), and CT-vaccinated (CT). Each bird was orally gavaged with 50 µg vaccine in 0.5 mL PBS or 0.5 mL PBS only on d 0, 3, 7 and 14 of age. At 21 d of age, the CN group had higher anti-ECP IgA than control (P < 0.05). At 21 d of age, the CN and CT group had higher anti-ECP IgA than control (P < 0.05). At 17 d of age, the CN group had higher anti-flagellar IgG than control (P < 0.05). At 10 d of age, the CN group had higher anti-flagellar IgA than control (P < 0.05). Splenic T cells from chickens in the CN and CT group ex-vivo stimulated with 0.05 mg/mL ECP, had higher proliferation control (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 respectively). Splenic T cells from chickens in the CN and CT groups ex-vivo stimulated with 0.1 mg/mL ECP had proliferation than control (P < 0.05). Pooled serum from 17 d of age CN and CT-vaccinated birds partially neutralized toxins in 50 µg of ECP (P < 0.05). Pooled serum from 28 d of age CN-vaccinated birds also partially neutralized toxins in 50 µg of ECP. The result from this study indicates the potential for chitosan loaded with Clostridium perfringens extracellular proteins to be applied to necrotic enteritis challenge studies.

Molecular Investigation of SARS-CoV-2 Proteins and Their Interactions with Antiviral Drugs

A new Coronavirus strain, named SARS-CoV-2, suddenly emerged in early December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 resulted in being dramatically infectious, with thousands of people infected. In this scenario, and without effective vaccines available, the importance of an immediate tool to support patients and against viral diffusion becomes evident. In this study, we exploit the molecular docking approach to analyze the affinity between different viral proteins and several inhibitors, originally developed for other viral infections. Our data show that, in some cases, a relevant binding can be detected. These findings support the hypothesis to develop new antiviral agents against COVID-19, on the basis of already established therapies.

Interdisciplinary care for spinal cord injured refugees

INTRODUCTION: For war-injured refugees, spinal cord injury (SCI) is a leading cause of catastrophic neurologic injury and literature focused on the care of this vulnerable population is sparse. This case series describes the unique challenges presented to an outpatient interdisciplinary rehabilitation team in providing SCI care in the USA for refugees who suffered their SCI in their home countries. CASE PRESENTATION: Our interdisciplinary rehabilitation team faced challenges related to language, cultural and educational barriers which impacted the typical standard rehabilitation care offered to these individuals. Many of the individuals were focused on curative treatments. As such, managing expectations and educating individuals to rehabilitation practices for chronic SCI and lack of curative treatments for associated medical complications affected the provision of care across all disciplines of the rehabilitation team. DISCUSSION: This case series showcases the challenges of caring for international refugees with SCI. The care offered to these individuals highlights the benefits that an interdisciplinary SCI rehabilitation approach can provide to comprehensively care for this vulnerable population.

A systematic review on COVID-19: urological manifestations, viral RNA detection and special considerations in urological conditions

PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review on COVID-19 and its potential urological manifestations. METHODS: A literature search was performed using combination of keywords (MeSH terms and free text words) relating to COVID-19, urology, faeces and stool on multiple databases. Primary outcomes were the urological manifestations of COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection in urine and stool samples. Meta-analyses were performed when there were two or more studies reporting on the same outcome. Special considerations in urological conditions that were relevant in the pandemic of COVID-19 were reported in a narrative manner. RESULTS: There were a total of 21 studies with 3714 COVID-19 patients, and urinary symptoms were absent in all of them. In patients with COVID-19, 7.58% (95% CI 3.30-13.54%) developed acute kidney injury with a mortality rate of 93.27% (95% CI 81.46-100%) amongst them. 5.74% (95% CI 2.88-9.44%) of COVID-19 patients had positive viral RNA in urine samples, but the duration of viral shedding in urine was unknown. 65.82% (95% CI 45.71-83.51%) of COVID-19 patients had positive viral RNA in stool samples, which were detected from 2 to 47 days from symptom onset. 31.6% of renal transplant recipients with COVID-19 required non-invasive ventilation, and the overall mortality rate was 15.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Acute kidney injury leading to mortality is common amongst COVID-19 patients, likely as a result of direct viral toxicity. Viral RNA positivity was detected in both urine and stool samples, so precautions are needed when we perform transurethral or transrectal procedures.

Case Report: Right Bundle Brunch Block and QTc Prolongation in a Patient with COVID-19 Treated with Hydroxychloroquine

Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus-2 that has resulted in the current global pandemic. Currently, there is no available treatment proven to be effective against COVID-19, but multiple medications, including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), are used off label. We report the case of a 60-year-old woman without any cardiac history who developed right bundle brunch block and critically prolonged corrected electrocardiographic QT interval (QTc 631 ms) after treatment for 3 days with HCQ, which resolved on discontinuation of the medication. This case highlights a significant and potentially life-threatening complication of HCQ use.

SenWave: Monitoring the Global Sentiments under the COVID-19 Pandemic

Since the first alert launched by the World Health Organization (5 January, 2020), COVID-19 has been spreading out to over 180 countries and territories. As of June 18, 2020, in total, there are now over 8,400,000 cases and over 450,000 related deaths. This causes massive losses in the economy and jobs globally and confining about 58% of the global population. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel sentimental analysis work using 105+ million collected tweets and Weibo messages to evaluate the global rise and falls of sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. To make a fine-grained analysis on the feeling when we face this global health crisis, we annotate 10K tweets in English and 10K tweets in Arabic in 10 categories, including optimistic, thankful, empathetic, pessimistic, anxious, sad, annoyed, denial, official report, and joking. We then utilize an integrated transformer framework, called simpletransformer, to conduct multi-label sentimental classification by fine-tuning the pre-trained language model on the labeled data. Meanwhile, in order for a more complete analysis, we also translate the annotated English tweets into different languages (Spanish, Italian, and French) to generated training data for building sentiment analysis models for these languages. SenWave thus reveals the sentiment of global conversation in six different languages on COVID-19 (covering English, Spanish, French, Italian, Arabic and Chinese), followed the spread of the epidemic. The conversation showed a remarkably similar pattern of rapid rise and slow decline over time across all nations, as well as on special topics like the herd immunity strategies, to which the global conversation reacts strongly negatively. Overall, SenWave shows that optimistic and positive sentiments increased over time, foretelling a desire to seek, together, a reset for an improved COVID-19 world.

Population-Level Interest and Telehealth Capacity of US Hospitals in Response to COVID-19: Cross-Sectional Analysis of Google Search and National Hospital Survey Data

BACKGROUND: As the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is widely spreading across the United States, there is a concern about the overloading of the nation's health care capacity. The expansion of telehealth services is expected to deliver timely care for the initial screening of symptomatic patients while minimizing exposure in health care facilities, to protect health care providers and other patients. However, it is currently unknown whether US hospitals have the telehealth capacity to meet the increasing demand and needs of patients during this pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the population-level internet search volume for telehealth (as a proxy of population interest and demand) with the number of new COVID-19 cases and the proportion of hospitals that adopted a telehealth system in all US states. METHODS: We used internet search volume data from Google Trends to measure population-level interest in telehealth and telemedicine between January 21, 2020 (when the first COVID-19 case was reported), and March 18, 2020. Data on COVID-19 cases in the United States were obtained from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resources Center. We also used data from the 2018 American Hospital Association Annual Survey to estimate the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth (including telemedicine and electronic visits) and those with the capability of telemedicine intensive care unit (tele-ICU). Pearson correlation was used to examine the relations of population search volume for telehealth and telemedicine (composite score) with the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases in the United States during the study period and the proportion of hospitals with telehealth and tele-ICU capabilities. RESULTS: We found that US population-level interest in telehealth increased as the number of COVID-19 cases increased, with a strong correlation (r=0.948, P<.001). We observed a higher population-level interest in telehealth in the Northeast and West census region, whereas the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth was higher in the Midwest region. There was no significant association between population interest and the proportion of hospitals that adopted telehealth (r=0.055, P=.70) nor hospitals having tele-ICU capability (r=-0.073, P=.61). CONCLUSIONS: As the number of COVID-19 cases increases, so does the US population's interest in telehealth. However, the level of population interest did not correlate with the proportion of hospitals providing telehealth services in the United States, suggesting that increased population demand may not be met with the current telehealth capacity. Telecommunication infrastructures in US hospitals may lack the capability to address the ongoing health care needs of patients with other health conditions. More practical investment is needed to deploy the telehealth system rapidly against the impending patient surge.

Appropriate care for neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 disease

The global COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with high rates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, morbidity and mortality in the general population. Evidence-based guidance on caring for babies born to mothers with COVID-19 is needed. There is currently insufficient evidence to suggest vertical transmission between mothers and their newborn infants. However, transmission can happen after birth from mothers or other carers. Based on the currently available data, prolonged skin-to-skin contact and early and exclusive breastfeeding remain the best strategies to reduce the risks of morbidity and mortality for both the mother with COVID-19 and her baby.

Th22 cells are efficiently recruited in the gut by CCL28 as an alternative to CCL20 but do not compensate for the loss of Th17 cells in treated HIV-1-infected individuals

Gut CD4+ T cells are incompletely restored in most HIV-1-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy, notably Th17 cells, a key subset in mucosal homeostasis. By contrast, gut Th22 cells are usually restored at normal frequencies. Th22 cells display a CCR6+CCR10+ phenotype and could thus respond to CCL20- and CCL28-mediated chemotaxis, while Th17 cells, which express CCR6 but not CCR10, depend on CCL20. Herein, we found that CCL28 is normally expressed by duodenal enterocytes of treated HIV-1-infected individuals, while CCL20 expression is blunted. Ex vivo, we showed that Th22 cells contribute to the reduction of CCL20 production by enterocytes through an IL-22- and IL-18-dependent mechanism. Th22 cells preferentially migrate via CCL20- rather than CCL28-mediated chemotaxis when both chemokines are available in the microenvironment. However, when the CCL20/CCL28 ratio drops, as in treated HIV-1-infected individuals, Th22 cells can migrate via the CCR10-CCL28 axis, as an alternative to CCR6-CCL20. This could explain the better reconstitution of gut Th22 compared with Th17 cells on antiretroviral therapy. Lastly, we assessed the relationships between the frequencies of gut Th17 and Th22 cells and inflammatory markers related to microbial translocation, and showed that Th22 cells do not compensate for the loss of Th17 cells in treated HIV-1-infected individuals.

Two distinct cases with COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients

The fatality of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is precipitously increased in patients with underlying comorbidities or elderly people. Kidney transplant (KT) recipients are one of the vulnerable populations for infection. COVID-19 infection in KT recipients might be a complicated and awkward situation, but there has been a lack of reports concerning this group. Herein, we demonstrated two distinct cases with different clinical progress. The first case was a 36-year-old man who underwent KT 3 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 expressing relevant symptoms. Following administration of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine with reduced immunosuppressant, he recovered from COVID-19. However, the unexpected fluctuations in tacrolimus trough levels needed to be managed because of drug-to-drug interaction. The second case was developed in a 56-year-old man without any symptoms. He received a second KT from an ABO-incompatible donor 8 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 by screening due to exposure history. During the hospitalization period, the chest infiltrative lesion showed a wax and wane, but he successfully recovered by administration of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. These apparently different cases suggest that assertive screening and management could improve the clinical course. In addition, antiviral agents should be used cautiously, especially in patients on calcineurin inhibitors.

Sunlight exposure increased Covid-19 recovery rates: A study in the central pandemic area of Indonesia

This study aims to present the correlation between sunlight exposure and Covid-19 statuses in Jakarta, Indonesia. The secondary data analysis was derived from surveillance data for Covid-19 from government authorities, including the Ministry of Health, the Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency, and the local government of Jakarta. Three statuses related to Covid-19 were examined in the study: incidence, death, and recovered. Meanwhile, sunlight exposure was presented as daily duration of it. Only the number of recovered patients correlated significantly with sunlight exposure (p-value = .025; r = 0.350). This study's findings showed that sunlight exposure was associated with recovery from Covid-19.

First comprehensive computational analysis of functional consequences of TMPRSS2 SNPs in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 among different populations

Current SARS-CoV-2 pandemy mortality created the hypothesis that some populations may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS2 encodes a transmembrane serine protease which plays a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TMPRSS2 might influence SARS-CoV2 entry into the cell. This study aimed to investigate the impact of SNPs on TMPRSS2 function and structure. In silico tools such as Ensembl, Gtex, ExPASY 2, GEPIA, CCLE, KEGG and GO were engaged to characterize TMPRSS2 and its expression profile. The functional effects of SNPs were analyzed by PolyPhen-2, PROVEN, SNAP2, SIFT and HSF. Also, Phyre2, GOR IV and PSIPRED were used to predict the secondary structure of TMPRSS2. Moreover, post-translational modification (PTM) and secretory properties were analyzed through Modpredand Phobius, respectively. Finally, miRNA profiles were investigated by PolymiRTS and miRSNPs. Out of 11,184 retrieved SNPs from dbSNP, 92 showed a different frequency between Asians and other populations. Only 21 SNPs affected the function and structure of TMPRSS2 by influencing the protein folding, PTM, splicing and miRNA function. Particularly, rs12329760 may create a de novo pocket protein. rs875393 can create a donor site, silencer and broken enhancer motifs. rs12627374 affects a wide spectrum of miRNAs profile. This study highlighted the role of TMPRSS2 SNPs and epigenetic mechanisms especially non-coding RNAs in appearance of different susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 among different populations. Also, this study could pave the way to potential therapeutic implication of TMPRSS2 in designing antiviral drugs.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

Implementation of rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigenic testing in a laboratory without access to molecular methods: Experiences of a general hospital

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 Ag (Antigen) Respi-Strip assay is a new immunochromatographic diagnostic tool recently available for antigenic diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed sensitivity is not higher than 60 %, but its high specificity allows both quick decisions for the management of patients and confirmation by molecular diagnosis for only negative tests. However, from the first tests performed, we suspected that the sensitivity observed with routine use was much lower than that announced by the manufacturer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over a period of one month, we compared the negative results obtained with the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip kit with those obtained from qRT-PCR performed in a laboratory qualified for the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. All samples tested were naso-pharyngeal smears from UTM-RT medium. RESULTS: Of 774 patients tested, 714 negative samples were sent for confirmation, and 159 were found to be positive by qRT-PCR. The median positive percentage agreement was 23.9 % (95 % CI: 14.2 %-38.2 %). The Cohen's kappa score was 0.35. CONCLUSION: Using this immunochromatographic assay as a triage test did not significantly reduce the number of samples outsourced for COVID-19 confirmation by qRT-PCR. In addition, even if the turn-around time is short, the assay is completely manual, which is not suitable for large volumes of routine samples. The sensitivity of this rapid test is poor, and improvements are needed to enhance its performance.

Herbal medicine for treatment of children diagnosed with COVID-19: A review of guidelines

This review aimed to summarize and analyze the pattern identification (PI), herbal formulae, and composition of herbs provided by recent guidelines for the treatment of pediatric COVID-19. Seven data sources were reviewed until March 25, 2020. We analyzed the herbal formulae included in the guidelines and performed a network analysis to identify the frequency of herbs recommended in the herbal formulae. All 3 guidelines were provincial guidelines from China. Our results showed that there were 4 stages, 12 PIs, and 13 herbal formulae recommended by the provincial guidelines. These herbal formulae included a total of 56 herbs. Based on our network analysis, Scutellariae Radix was paired with Artemisiae Annuae Herba in one cluster. In another cluster, Armeniacae Semen was paired with Coicis Semen and Ephedrae Herba was paired with Gypsum Fibrosum. This review serves as a reference for the use of traditional medicine in the treatment of pediatric COVID-19.

Duration of viral shedding in asymptomatic or mild cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from a cruise ship: A single-hospital experience in Tokyo, Japan

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the cause of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first reported in Wuhan, China, and now has spread across the world as a global pandemic. The propagation from asymptomatic polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive individuals represents a complicating factor in the efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the course of PCR assays and the duration of viral shedding in 23 asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients from the cruise ship who were admitted to our hospital. Among these 23 cases, the median duration of viral shedding was 19 days (range, 6-37 days) from initial viral detection. Eight cases (35%) had another positive PCR result after testing negative once. Although the duration of viral shedding was approximately three weeks, the infectivity and transmissibility period from asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 cases is unclear. Further studies are needed to determine how long such asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 cases have infectivity.

Health system's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in conflict settings: Policy reflections from Palestine

As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads, concerns are particularly serious in conflict and humanitarian settings. Tackling the pandemic in those countries is challenging due to the fragility of socioeconomic and health systems. Palestine is one of those countries that is facing compounding challenges, instability, fragility, living conditions, poverty, and mobility, all of which are caused by multifactorial etiology. The Pandemic shows triple tragedies; virus (COVID-19 Pandemic), ongoing Israeli occupation (Politics), and Intra-Palestinian divide (Policies). Yet, Palestine's response to the pandemic is outperforming many countries in the region. The early preventative lockdown measures in the West Bank found effective and not overwhelming the already over-stretched health system. While in the Gaza Strip, the response was slow. Prisoners, labours, besieged people, socioeconomic-disadvantaged classes, and refugees were put at additional high risk. Nonetheless, measures taken were unconsolidated in both regions largely due to the political factors. A little collaboration and inter-agency task forces in preparedness and response was observed, and the mechanisms and governance remain ambiguous. A consolidated and evidence-based nation-wide plan is required, whereby state and non-state actors have a clear and transparent exit strategy. A new thinking approach to promote the public health system and evidence-informed policies in Palestine is an urgent national priority.

Dynamic linkage of COVID-19 test results between Public Health England's Second Generation Surveillance System and UK Biobank

UK Biobank (UKB) is an international health resource enabling research into the genetic and lifestyle determinants of common diseases of middle and older age. It comprises 500â000 participants. Public Health England's Second Generation Surveillance System is a centralized microbiology database covering English clinical diagnostics laboratories that provides national surveillance of legally notifiable infections, bacterial isolations and antimicrobial resistance. We previously developed secure, pseudonymized, individual-level linkage of these systems. In this study, we implemented rapid dynamic linkage, which allows us to provide a regular feed of new COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) test results to UKB to facilitate rapid and urgent research into the epidemiological and human genetic risk factors for severe infection in the cohort. Here, we have characterized the first 1352 cases of COVID-19 in UKB participants, of whom 895 met our working definition of severe COVID-19 as inpatients hospitalized on or after 16 March 2020. We found that the incidence of severe COVID-19 among UKB cases was 27.4â% lower than the general population in England, although this difference varied significantly by age and sex. The total number of UKB cases could be estimated as 0.6â% of the publicly announced number of cases in England. We considered how increasing case numbers will affect the power of genome-wide association studies. This new dynamic linkage system has further potential to facilitate the investigation of other infections and the prospective collection of microbiological cultures to create a microbiological biobank (bugbank) for studying the interaction of environment, human and microbial genetics on infection in the UKB cohort.

Potential drug-drug interactions associated with drugs currently proposed for COVID-19 treatment in patients receiving other treatments

Patients with COVID-19 are sometimes already being treated for one or more other chronic conditions, especially if they are elderly. Introducing a treatment against COVID-19, either on an outpatient basis or during hospitalization for more severe cases, raises the question of potential drug-drug interactions. Here, we analyzed the potential or proven risk of the co-administration of drugs used for the most common chronic diseases and those currently offered as treatment or undergoing therapeutic trials for COVID-19. Practical recommendations are offered, where possible.

Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Iranian patients with epilepsy

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on patients' perceptions of hardship in obtaining their drugs and if this pandemic and the social restrictions in response to that has resulted in any changes in their seizure control status. We also investigated factors potentially associated with the perceptions of difficulty in obtaining their drugs (e.g., polytherapy vs. monotherapy, taking imported drugs, and seizure status worsening). METHODS: We surveyed a random sample of patients with epilepsy, who were registered in our database at Shiraz Epilepsy Center, Iran, on their perceptions on two issues: What has been your experience on obtaining your antiseizure medications in the past four weeks (compared to before)? Have you experienced any changes in your seizure control status in the past four weeks? RESULTS: We included 100 patients (53 male and 47 female patients). In response to the question "Have you had any difficulties in the past 4 weeks to obtain your drugs?", 31 people (31%) expressed hardship obtaining their drugs. In response to the question "How has been your seizure control status compared with before?", six people (6%) expressed worsening of their seizure control status in the past 4 weeks. None of the patients reported symptoms of coronavirus infection. CONCLUSION: About one-third of patients with epilepsy expressed significant hardship obtaining their drugs after the intensification of the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. The current COVID-19 pandemic could be considered as a major shock to a nation that has already been under significant pressure (i.e., Iran).

Covid-19 -- A simple statistical model for predicting ICU load in exponential phases of the disease

One major bottleneck in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is the limited number of critical care beds. Due to the dynamic development of infections and the time lag between when patients are infected and when a proportion of them enters an intensive care unit (ICU), the need for future intensive care can easily be underestimated. To derive future ICU load from reported infections, we suggest a simple statistical model that (1) accounts for time lags and (2) allows for making predictions depending on different future growth rates. We evaluate our model for public data from Berlin, Germany, by first estimating the model parameters (i.e., time lag and average stay in ICU) for March 2020 and then using an exponential model to predict the future ICU load for April and May 2020. Assuming an ICU rate of 5%, a time lag of 5 days and an average stay of 14 days in ICU provide the best fit of the data and is in accord with independent estimates. Our model is then used to predict future ICU load assuming a continued exponential phase with varying growth rates (0-15%). For example, based on our parameters the model predicts that the number of ICU patients at the end of May would be 246 if the exponential growth were to continue at a rate of 3%, 1,056 if the growth rate were 5% and 3,758 if the growth rate were 7%. The model can be adjusted as estimates of parameters develop and can thus also help to predict a potential exceedance of ICU capacity. Although our predictions are based on a small data set, disregard non-stationary dynamics, and have a number of assumptions, especially an exponential development of cases, our model is simple, robust, adaptable and can be up-dated when further data become available.

Detection of Listeria spp. in cattle and environment of pasture-based dairy farms/ Detecção de Listeria spp. em gados leiteiros no meio ambiente com base na pastagem

The aim of the study was to detect Listeria spp., particularly Listeria monocytogenes, in cattle and environment of pasture based dairy farms in Paysandú, Uruguay. A two-stage sampling was conducted, 10 farms were selected by probability proportional to size. A single visit was made to each farm. Samples from bovine faeces, feedstuffs, bulk tank milk, drinking water and soil from the entry and exit pens of the milking parlour were collected for bacteriological studies. PCR assays were used to confirm species and determine the serotype profile of L. monocytogenes isolates. AscI-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was done to genetically compare them. Listeria spp. were isolated from eight of ten dairy farms, whereas L. monocytogenes in three of them. Serotype distribution in L. monocytogenes was as follows: 1/2a, three isolates; 4b, one isolate. L. monocytogenes or L. innocua excreted from clinically healthy milking cows was detected via faeces. In feedstuffs, only one L. monocytogenes 1/2a isolate from a pasture was obtained. The strain was identical by PFGE to an isolate 1/2a obtained from a pool of milking cow feces that grazed on this farm. No isolation of Listeria spp. was retrieved from the bulk tank milk or drinking water from any of the farms. Listeria innocua was detected in 13 feedstuffs and seven samples of soil from the entry and exit pens of the milking parlour. This is a first local study that confirms the presence of Listeria spp. including L. monocytogenes in healthy cattle and environment of pasture-based dairy farms. These results suggest the potential role that healthy cattle and their sub-products would play as a source of these agents for humans and/or others animals. More detailed studies that include genetic comparison of human and animal isolates are required in order to clearly establish the epidemiological relationship.(AU)

Innovative Use of High-Fidelity Lung Simulators to Test a Ventilator Splitter Device

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly exposed health care system inadequacies. Hospital ventilator shortages in Italy compelled US physicians to consider creative solutions, such as using Y-pieces or T-pieces, to preclude the need to make decisions of life or death based on medical equipment availability. We add to current knowledge and testing capacity for ventilator splitters by reporting the ability to examine the functionality of ventilator splitters by using 2 high-fidelity lung simulators. Data obtained by the high-fidelity lung simulators included: tidal volume, respiratory rate, minute ventilation, peak inspiratory pressure, peak plateau pressure, and positive end-expiratory pressure.

COVID-19: Stroke Admissions, Emergency Department Visits, and Prevention Clinic Referrals

We assessed the impact of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic on code stroke activations in the emergency department, stroke unit admissions, and referrals to the stroke prevention clinic at London's regional stroke center, serving a population of 1.8 million in Ontario, Canada. We found a 20% drop in the number of code strokes in 2020 compared to 2019, immediately after the first cases of COVID-19 were officially confirmed. There were no changes in the number of stroke admissions and there was a 22% decrease in the number of clinic referrals, only after the provincial lockdown. Our findings suggest that the decrease in code strokes was mainly driven by patient-related factors such as fear to be exposed to the SARS-CoV-2, while the reduction in clinic referrals was largely explained by hospital policies and the Government lockdown.

COVID-19: Moving beyond the pandemic

Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of COVID-19. As of April 11th, 2020, there were almost 2 million cases of COVID-19 internationally and over 100,000 deaths (John Hopkins University, 2020). There has been significant effort to increase hospital and healthcare capacity to reduce the number of fatalities associated with this global pandemic (Choi & Logsdon 2020).

Dementia care and COVID-19 pandemic: a necessary digital revolution

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most memory clinics have had to suspend their activities. On the other hand, international dementia experts have recommended to provide urgently worldwide support for people living with dementia. This situation urges to play out new strategies to guarantee adequate care. Telemedicine and digital technology (DT) devices, such as smartphones, can be very helpful in remote monitoring and care. Technological devices such as videoconference or smartphone apps might be used for follow-up visits and support to patients and caregivers and to acquire digital markers of clinical progression. Hopefully, this dramatic situation would facilitate the process of progressive familiarization of neurologists with telemedicine and DT approach.

Statistical Physics of Epidemic on Network Predictions for SARS-CoV-2 Parameters

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has necessitated mitigation efforts around the world. We use only reported deaths in the two weeks after the first death to determine infection parameters, in order to make predictions of hidden variables such as the time dependence of the number of infections. Early deaths are sporadic and discrete so the use of network models of epidemic spread is imperative, with the network itself a crucial random variable. Location-specific population age distributions and population densities must be taken into account when attempting to fit these events with parametrized models. These characteristics render naive Bayesian model comparison impractical as the networks have to be large enough to avoid finite-size effects. We reformulated this problem as the statistical physics of independent location-specific `balls' attached to every model in a six-dimensional lattice of 56448 parametrized models by elastic springs, with model-specific `spring constants' determined by the stochasticity of network epidemic simulations for that model. The distribution of balls then determines all Bayes posterior expectations. Important characteristics of the contagion are determinable: the fraction of infected patients that die ($0.017\pm 0.009$), the expected period an infected person is contagious ($22 \pm 6$ days) and the expected time between the first infection and the first death ($25 \pm 8$ days) in the US. The rate of exponential increase in the number of infected individuals is $0.18\pm 0.03$ per day, corresponding to 65 million infected individuals in one hundred days from a single initial infection, which fell to 166000 with even imperfect social distancing effectuated two weeks after the first recorded death. The fraction of compliant socially-distancing individuals matters less than their fraction of social contact reduction for altering the cumulative number of infections.

Intravenous high-dose vitamin C for the treatment of severe COVID-19: study protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial

INTRODUCTION: The rapid worldwide spread of COVID-19 has caused a global health crisis. To date, symptomatic supportive care has been the most common treatment. It has been reported that the mechanism of COVID-19 is related to cytokine storms and subsequent immunogenic damage, especially damage to the endothelium and alveolar membrane. Vitamin C (VC), also known as L-ascorbic acid, has been shown to have antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties. A high dose of intravenous VC (HIVC) was proven to block several key components of cytokine storms, and HIVC showed safety and varying degrees of efficacy in clinical trials conducted on patients with bacterial-induced sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, we hypothesise that HIVC could be added to the treatment of ARDS and multiorgan dysfunction related to COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The investigators designed a multicentre prospective randomised placebo-controlled trial that is planned to recruit 308 adults diagnosed with COVID-19 and transferred into the intensive care unit. Participants will randomly receive HIVC diluted in sterile water or placebo for 7 days once enrolled. Patients with a history of VC allergy, end-stage pulmonary disease, advanced malignancy or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency will be excluded. The primary outcome is ventilation-free days within 28 observational days. This is one of the first clinical trials applying HIVC to treat COVID-19, and it will provide credible efficacy and safety data. We predict that HIVC could suppress cytokine storms caused by COVID-19, help improve pulmonary function and reduce the risk of ARDS of COVID-19. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (identifiers: Clinical Ethical Approval No. 2020001). Findings of the trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and scientific conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04264533.

Immunoinformatic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein as a strategy to assess cross-protection against COVID-19

Envelope protein of coronaviruses is a structural protein existing in both monomeric and homo-pentameric form. It has been related to a multitude of roles including virus infection, replication, dissemination and immune response stimulation. In the present study, we employed an immunoinformatic approach to investigate the major immunogenic domains of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein and map them among the homologue proteins of coronaviruses with tropism for animal species that are closely inter-related with the human beings population all over the world. Also, when not available, we predicted the envelope protein structural folding and mapped SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Envelope sequences alignment provides evidence of high sequence homology for some of the investigated virus specimens; while the structural mapping of epitopes resulted in the interesting maintenance of the structural folding and epitope sequence localization also in the envelope proteins scoring a lower alignment score. In line with the One-Health approach, our evidences provide a molecular structural rationale for a potential role of taxonomically related coronaviruses in conferring protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifying potential candidates for the development of diagnostic tools and prophylactic-oriented strategies.

The Area of a Rough Black Hole

We investigate the consequences for the black hole area of introducing fractal structure for the horizon geometry. We create a three-dimensional spherical analogue of a 'Koch Snowflake' using a infinite diminishing hierarchy of touching spheres around the Schwarzschild event horizon. We can create a fractal structure for the horizon with finite volume and infinite (or finite) area. This is a toy model for the possible effects of quantum gravitational spacetime foam, with significant implications for assessments of the entropy of black holes and the universe, which is generally larger than in standard picture of black hole structure and thermodynamics, potentially by very considerable factors. The entropy of the observable universe today becomes log(S) is approximately 120(1+D/2) with D = 0 for a smooth spacetime structure and D = 1 for the most intricate. The Hawking lifetime of black holes is also reduced.

Practice and thinking of the informationized cabin hospitals during the novel coronavirus pneumonia period/ 中华医院管理杂志

Novel coronavirus pneumonia, which has emerged in Wuhan since the end of 2019, has posed a huge challenge for medical institutions in the city. Rapid completion of a number of cabin hospitals plays a vital role in preventing further spreading of the epidemic, by means of collecting and treating mild patients of the disease. This paper presents the key process of Tongji Hospital in its rapid informatization since it took over a cabin hospital. Based on the network architecture of the Tongji cloud platform, the shared service center is used to share data and integrate services between the cabin hospital and Tongji hospital. This practice can prevent cross-infection and improve service efficiency as well, hence offering a reference for future information infrastructure development of cabin hospitals.

Exposure to coronavirus news on mainstream media: The role of risk perceptions and depression

OBJECTIVE: The mainstream media tend to rely on news content that will increase risk perceptions of pandemic outbreaks to stimulate public response and persuade people to comply with preventive behaviours. The objective of this study was to examine associations between exposure to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) news, risk perceptions, and depressive symptoms. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected from 501 participants who were &#8805;18 years. Exposure to COVID-19 news was assessed as our exposure variable. We screened for depression (outcome variable) with the Patient Health Questionnaire and examined the roles of risk perceptions. Multiple linear regressions and mediation analysis with 1000 bootstrap resamples were conducted. RESULTS: Participants were 55.29% female, 67.86% White with mean age 32.44 ± 11.94 years. After controlling for sociodemographic and socio-economic factors, news exposure was positively associated with depressive symptoms ß = .11; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 0.02-0.20. Mediation analysis showed that perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 mediated 34.4% of this relationship (ß = .04; 95%CI = 0.01-0.06). CONCLUSION: Perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 can serve as a pathway through which exposure to COVID-19 news on mainstream media may be associated with depressive symptoms. Based on our findings, we offered recommendations for media-health partnership, practice, and research.

Spiralian Genomes Reveal Gene Family Expansions Associated with Adaptation to Freshwater

The colonization of freshwater habitats by marine-adapted organisms represents a major transition that has only occurred a few times in the evolution of animals. Only around half of the extant animal phyla have representatives in both marine and freshwater environments and even within those phyla some major clades are restricted to marine environments. Moving from marine to freshwater environments can create severe osmotic and ionic stresses and the mechanisms that animals have used to adapt to those stresses are still not well understood. In this study, we downloaded amino acid sequence data from 11 spiralian animal genomes (four freshwater taxa representing four different phyla as well as 7 marine taxa) and identified a number of gene family expansions that have occurred exclusively in the freshwater lineages. Further investigation of these gene families and the timing and nature of their expansions will illuminate one of the major evolutionary transitions in the history of life on Earth.

A Report of the Telepsychiatric Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 Patients

Objective: During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, telemedicine has been brought to the forefront of attention. This report aimed to assess psychiatric comorbidities in COVID-19 patients by utilizing telepsychiatry. Methods: COVID-19 patients admitted in Fasa University Hospital and nonhospitalized outpatients of Fasa city were interviewed by a psychiatrist through video chat for a 1-month period (March-April, 2020). Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7), and Perceived Stress Scale-14 (PSS 14) questionnaires were administered for all patients. Each patient's mental status was recorded, and if any psychiatric problem was diagnosed, supportive psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and follow-up visits based on the patient's condition were started. Result: From a total of 82 COVID-19 patients who entered the study, 32 (39.03%) and 50 (60.97%) subjects were inpatients and outpatients, respectively. Moreover, 32 (39.03%) subjects were male and 50 (60.97%) were female. Insomnia seen in 24 (29.3%) patients and adjustment disorder in 13 (15.9%) patients were the most common psychiatric disorders among a total of 33 (40.2%) patients suffering from mental illness. Female and hospitalized patients presented significantly more frequent comorbidities than males and outpatients. Conclusions: Psychiatric disorders were significantly more common in patients with hospital admission than those without and more frequent in female versus male subjects. There were no significant differences between male and female subjects with and without admission according to the PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PSS-14 scores. It was concluded that telepsychiatry in the early stages of mental problems during a catastrophic event like the coronavirus pandemic, can be an efficient instrument for the screening of psychosomatic comorbidities, so that pharmacological treatment (considering possible drug interactions with COVID-19 medications) and psychotherapeutic intervention can be optimized by psychiatrists.

[Significance and operation mode of moxibustion intervention for the group under quarantine after close contact with COVID-19]

On the base of the idea of traditional Chinese medicine as "disease prevention", the mode and the protocol of the moxibustion intervention for the group under quarantine after close contact with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were explored. The group under quarantine after close contact with COVID-19 was taken as the subjects. By the non-contact physician-patient communication network platform co-developed by China Association of Acupuncture-Moxibustion, Hunan Provincial Association of Acupuncture-Moxibustion, Data Center of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences and Yuge Medicine Company, an exploratory randomized controlled trial was designed. A total of 100 cases were included and randomized into a moxibustion group and a conventional intervention group, 50 cases in each one. In the moxibustion group, moxibustion intervention was used. In the conventional intervention group, the conventional observation was adopted without moxibusiton intervention applied. The outcomes included the symptoms changes, e.g. anxiety, emotional disturbance, fatigue, headache and diarrhea, as well as whether quarantine release and the case confirmed or not, etc. The results were evaluated before intervention, in 14 days of intervention and 2 weeks after intervention separately. In this research, on the base of internet plus technology and with the internet communication platform adopted, through mobile phone WeChat App, it was to implement the subject screen, the random allocation and the instruction of moxibustion intervention as well as the quality control of patient's diary and data collection. It is anticipated that the significance and the implementation mode of moxibustion intervention can be assessed preliminarily for the group under quarantine after close contact with COVID-19.

Mental status of patients with chronic insomnia in China during COVID-19 epidemic

AIM: To study the sleep and mental health of chronic insomnia patients in China during coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. METHODS: A total of 764 patients with chronic insomnia were included in this study. From 17 January 2020 to 24 January 2020, insomnia, anxiety and physical symptoms were evaluated online, and they were followed up for 4 and 8 weeks. Main outcomes and indicators were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and each factor score, the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), respectively. In addition, insomnia, anxiety and physical symptoms were assessed at baseline and at the end of fourth and eighth weeks. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare the changes in patients' scale scores at different time points. RESULTS: Among the 764 participants, there were 755 and 738 evaluators who completed the fourth and eighth weeks, respectively, and the questionnaire completion rates were 98.82% and 96.60%, respectively. Among them, there are 459 (60.0%) aged 41-60 years old, 546 (71.5%) women, 218 (28.5%) men and 313 (41%) college degrees. After 8 weeks of follow-up, the differences in sleep status, anxiety symptoms and physical symptoms were statistically significant. Among the factors of PSQI, there were differences in subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep disturbance (disorder), sleep efficiency and daytime function. At 4 weeks of follow-up, there was a statistically significant difference in the use of hypnotic drugs; at 8 weeks of follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference in the use of hypnotic drugs. CONCLUSION: Under the influence of the COVID-19, the sleep status and anxiety of patients with chronic insomnia are affected by the epidemic.

Clinical Prognosis of Right-Sided Infective Endocarditis not Associated with Cardiac Devices or Intravenous Drug use: a Cohort Study and Meta-Analysis

Right-sided infective endocarditis (RSIE), classically associated with intravenous drug use or intracardiac devices, is considered a good-prognosis infective endocarditis (IE) form. However, predisposing factors and prognosis for "NODID" RSIE (NOt associated with cardiac Devices or Intravenous Drug use) remain unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate predisposing factors and prognosis of NODID RSIE compared to other RSIE forms. A retrospective cohort study (January 2008-January 2019) was conducted in a reference center on 300 patients diagnosed with IE. Endocarditis-related events were defined as related to IE in mortality or open-heart surgery during follow-up. A review and meta-analysis of associated literature (January 2008-January 2019) were also performed. Fifty-seven patients presented RSIE (19%), 22 of which were NODID RSIE (39%). Use of intravascular catheters (23% vs 3%; p = 0.027) and congenital heart diseases (18% vs 0%; p = 0.019) were associated with NODID RSIE. This group had a higher in-hospital mortality (23% vs 3%; p = 0.027) and endocarditis-related event rates (41% vs 6%; p = 0.001) than non-NODID RSIE. Furthermore, NODID RSIE was independently associated with in-hospital endocarditis-related events (OR = 19.29; 95%CI:2.23-167.16; p = 0.007). Our meta-analysis evaluated four studies and identified 96 cases (30%) of NODID RSIE from 320 total RSIE cases. NODID RSIE patients demonstrated higher in-hospital mortality (RR = 2.81; 95%CI:1.61-4.90; p < 0.001; I2 = 0.0%) and necessity of open-heart surgery (RR = 13.89; 95%CI:4.14-46.60; p < 0.001; I2 = 0.0%) than non-NODID RSIE cases. Our study suggests that NODID RSIE has the highest endocarditis-related event rate and in-hospital mortality among RSIE cases and therefore should not be considered a good-prognosis IE.

Redesign of a GI endoscopy unit during the COVID-19 emergency: A practical model

The pandemic diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout the world required measures to prevent and strategies to control the infection, as well as the reallocation of the hospital structures in order to take care of an increased number of infected patients. Endoscopy Units should be able to perform endoscopic procedures on COVID-19 infected as well as on noninfected patients. The aim of this manuscript is to propose a model for a fast reorganization of the endoscopy department environment in order to safely perform endoscopic procedures in this Pandemic COVID-19 scenario, according to the current advices given by the Scientific Societies.

Infection control practices for SARS in Lao People's Democratic Republic, Taiwan, and Thailand: Experience from mobile SARS containment teams, 2003

BACKGROUND: Despite available recommendations on infection control for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), information is limited on actual practices in Asian hospitals during the epidemic. We describe practices observed by mobile SARS containment teams (mobile teams) during outbreak investigations. METHODS: We retrospectively summarized infection control practices observed in hospitals visited by mobile teams in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), Taiwan, and Thailand, during March and April 2003. RESULTS: Mobile teams investigated 22 reports of SARS in 20 hospitals (1, 5, and 14 hospitals in Lao PDR, Taiwan, and Thailand, respectively). Facilities ranged from urban hospitals with negative-pressure isolation rooms and high-efficiency particulate air filtration to rural hospitals with patient rooms open to outside air circulation and intermittent running water. At the time of mobile team visits, 5 (25%) hospitals implemented infection control practices consistent with World Health Organization recommendations on visitor policies, private negative-pressure rooms, and personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Early in the SARS epidemic, mobile teams found wide variations in infection control practices and resources among Asian hospitals evaluating patients for SARS, indicating the importance of ongoing assessment during SARS preparedness. Mobile teams are one mechanism to assess practices and promote implementation of recommended infection control measures.

Restructuring an Academic Dermatology Practice During the COVID‐19 Pandemic

SARS‐COV‐2 is a highly virulent positive‐sense single stranded RNA virus that spreads rapidly via respiratory droplets, causing severe acute respiratory syndromes with significant mortality and morbidity. Currently 210 countries and territories are affected around the world with a reported 2.6 million confirmed cases.(1) The COVID 19 pandemic has changed the way patients attend their specialist appointments and receive medical care. Whilst some specialist clinics have closed we have implemented strategies and restructured our academic practice in Australia to minimize the spread of disease whilst treating patients who need urgent care. We hope to share these strategies in the hope they may be useful to the dermatology community. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

A three-dimensional A549 cell culture model to study respiratory syncytial virus infections

Abstract Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, affecting infants, young children, and immune-compromised patients; however, currently no vaccine is available for prevention of RSV infections. The overwhelming majority of our knowledge of how RSV causes infection is based upon studies that have been carried out using traditional 2D methods, with cells cultured on flat plastic dishes. Although these simplified culture systems are essential to gain an insight into the fundamentals of host-pathogen interactions, cells in 2D are not exposed to the same conditions as cells in 3D tissues in the body and are therefore a poor representation of thein vivo microenvironment. In this study, we aim to develop the first 3D culture model for RSV infection using A549 cells to test its utility for RSV pathogenesis. Methods To generate spheroids, A549 cells were cultured using ultra-low attachment plates to generate 25 × 103 cell spheroids. The viability of the spheroids was assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay and flow cytometry showing prominent live cells throughout the spheroids confirming high viability over seven days of incubation. Results Immunostaining of A549 spheroids inoculated with RSV, showed time-dependent dissemination of the viral antigen RSV-F within the spheroid, resulting in syncytia formation and a 3-fold increase in mucin secretion compared to the uninfected cells. Additionally, RSV successfully replicated in the spheroids producing infectious virus as early as day one post-inoculation and was sustained for up to 7 days post-inoculation. Conclusions Results show that A549 spheroids are susceptible and permissive for RSV since they exhibit the characteristics of RSV infection including syncytia formation and mucin overexpression, suggesting that A549 spheroids can be used a promising model for studying RSV in vitro.

Metallothionein (I+II) confers, via c-myc, immune plasticity in oldest mice: model of partial hepatectomy/liver regeneration

Abstract Because of its similarity to ageing in impaired immune efficiency 48 h after surgical procedures on young partially hepatectomised mice, partial hepatectomy/liver regeneration (pHx) provides a good model for the study of inflammation in ageing. In old age, high metallothionein (I+II) (MT) sequesters a substantial number of intracellular zinc ions consequently leading to low zinc ion bioavailability for an adequate immune response. Corticosterone and IL-6 affect MTmRNA induction in inflammation and after pHx against oxidative damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the role played by MT in conferring immune plasticity in ageing and in very old age using the pHx model. 48 h after their partial hepatectomy, the crude zinc balance was negative in young, old and very old mice coupled with increased MT, corticosterone, sIL-6R and IL-6. Concomitantly, Natural Killer (NK) cell activity and IL-2 production decreased. Complete restoration of the nutritional–endocrine–immune parameters occurred 15 days from the surgical procedures in young and very old mice, but not in old or transgenic mice overexpressing MT. A significant positive or inverse correlation among nutritional–endocrine–immune parameters exists in young and very old mice, but not in old mice during liver regeneration. Since MT also affects c-myc, the gene expression of c-myc declines from 48 h to days 7 and 15 after pHx in young and very old mice, but remains constantly high in old pHx mice for the same days. This circumstance leads to the appearance of tumours in the long run in old pHx mice and survival times that are shorter than old sham controls. Because complete remodelling also occurs in IL-6 and in sIL-6R in very old mice during liver regeneration, the pre-existing inflammation is not detrimental in very old age. As such, very old mice are still responsive to large inflammation, such as pHx, thanks to correct MT homeostasis. Correct MT homeostasis, via c-myc, is therefore pivotal in both suitable liver regeneration and in conferring immune plasticity with subsequent successful ageing. High MT plays an extremely harmful role in ageing: on one hand it lowers zinc ion bioavailability levels required for immune efficiency and on the other hand it increases c-myc expression. The combination of immune depression and enhanced c-myc, via high MT, may trigger the appearance of age-related degenerative diseases.

Epidemiology of respiratory viral infections in children enrolled in a study of influenza vaccine effectiveness

BACKGROUND: Influenza-like illness (ILI) confers a high annual morbidity in young children. We report the epidemiology of ILIs in children who participated in an influenza vaccine effectiveness study during the 2010 Southern Hemisphere influenza season in Sydney, Australia. METHODS: Children aged 0·5–3 years were prospectively recruited from child care centres (CCCs). We classified them as fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated and unvaccinated according to their receipt of unadjuvanted vaccines containing influenza A (H1N1)pdm09. For 13 weeks commencing 30 July 2010, parents reported when their children developed an ILI (fever ≥37·8°C/feverishness plus ≥1 respiratory symptom) and collected nose and/or throat swabs for multiplex respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Health impacts were assessed by telephone interview at enrolment and two weeks after each ILI. RESULTS: There were 124 ILIs reported in 105 of 381 enrolled children. Swabs were taken in 117 ILIs: 175 viruses were identified from 103 swabs. Adeno- and rhinoviruses were most frequently identified; 44% of swabs yielded multiple viruses. No virus was associated with more severe symptoms, although rhinovirus-related ILIs lasted longer. Nose swabs had a higher virus detection rate than throat swabs. Influenza-vaccinated children were 1·6 times (P = 0·001) more likely than unvaccinated children to have a non-influenza ILI. CONCLUSION: Adeno- and rhinoviruses were the most common viruses causing ILI. Swabs taken by parents are an effective method for sample collection. Influenza-like illness was more common in children vaccinated against influenza in this observational study, but prior health-seeking behaviour may have contributed to this difference.

Effect of a quadrivalent vaccine against respiratory virus on the incidence of respiratory disease in weaned beef calves

Abstract We investigated the effect of vaccination of male beef calves (mean age±S.D.: 158±31days) against bovine herpes virus (BHV-1 or IBR virus), bovine respiratory syncitial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) virus and para-influenza (PI3) virus on the incidence of respiratory disease during the first forty days after weaning and entering a feed-lot in Portugal. In May 2003, Mertolenga, Preta and mixed-breed calves from 10 different beef herds, were systematically assigned (by order of entrance in a chute) to two treatment groups, before moving to a common feed-lot. One hundred and twenty five male calves were vaccinated with a quadrivalent vaccine (Rispoval 4®) and revaccinated after 21–27 days while 148 herdmates were injected with saline (0.9% NaCl) on the same occasions. The incidence and severity of clinical cases of “bovine respiratory disease” (BRD) were evaluated every day during the first 40 days after entering the feed-lot. Morbidity (3% vs. 14%) and mortality (0% vs. 4%) due to BRD were significantly lower in the vaccinated group. Ten days after revaccination, the calves were treated with an antimicrobial – ending the study – after an outbreak of BRD caused a high incidence of disease in the non-vaccinated group. In conclusion, our results showed that Rispoval 4®, a quadrivalent vaccine against respiratory viruses, under field conditions, reduces morbidity and mortality due to BRD in beef calves after weaning.

Characterization of HCoV-229E fusion core: Implications for structure basis of coronavirus membrane fusion

Abstract Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), a member of group I coronaviruses, has been identified as one of the major viral agents causing respiratory tract diseases in humans for nearly 40 years. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of the membrane fusion mediated by the spike (S) protein of HCoV-229E remains elusive. Here, we report, for the first time, a rationally designed fusion core of HCoV-229E (HR1-SGGRGG-HR2), which was in vitro produced in GST prokaryotic expression system. Multiple lines of experimental data including gel-filtration, chemical cross-linking, and circular diagram (CD) demonstrated that the HCoV-229E fusion core possesses the typical properties of the trimer of coiled-coil heterodimer (six α-helix bundle). 3D structure modeling presents its most-likely structure, similar to those of coronaviruses that have been well-documented. Collectively, HCoV-229E S protein belongs to the type I fusion protein, which is characterized by the existence of two heptad-repeat regions (HR1 and HR2), furthermore, the available knowledge concerning HCoV-229E fusion core may make it possible to design small molecule or polypeptide drugs targeting the membrane fusion, a crucial step of HCoV-229E infection.

COVID-19 and Italy: what next?

The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30 000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3–4 days, departing from the exponential trend. However, this cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.

Global toxocariasis research trends from 1932 to 2015: a bibliometric analysis

BACKGROUND: Toxocariasis is a highly prevalent parasitic disease in the tropical regions of the world, with its impact on public health being typically underestimated. To better recognise the trends and characteristics of toxocariasis research, this study is a bibliometric analysis of the global toxocariasis research. METHODS: Searches were completed on April 5, 2016, using the Scopus database. A search without any language restriction was performed to extract publications dealing with toxocariasis. Terms related to toxocariasis were used to perform a title keyword search. RESULTS: A total of 2765 publications comprising 11 document types and published between 1932 and 2015 were included in the analysis. Articles were the most popular document form, accounting for 83.62% of all publications, followed by letters (3.80%) and reviews (3.4%). The annual number of research publications increased from 30 in 1980 to 111 in 2015, indicating that the number of publications on toxocariasis has increased slowly over the past 35 years. The United States of America and Japan are the predominant countries of origin, with 303 articles and 207 articles, respectively, followed by Brazil and the United Kingdom, with 180 (6.5%) each. The h-index for all the publications was 60. The highest h-index were for publications from the United Kingdom (h-index value = 43) and the United States (h-index value = 39); these two countries were also involved with the highest number of international collaborations, with 27 and 28 countries, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Developed countries, including the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy, are the world’s leaders in toxocariasis research, contributing to more than 34% of the total published literature. In addition, developing countries, such as Brazil, Poland, Argentina and India, showed a noticeable increase in published papers on toxocariasis research in recent years. A push for more collaboration is needed to achieve a superior research strategy related to toxocariasis at the global level from the viewpoint of epidemiological data, clinical aspects, medical ecology, molecular aspects and treatment practices associated with toxocariasis.

A Call to Arms: Emergency Hand and Upper Extremity Operations During the COVID-19 Pandemic

ABSTRACT Purpose Limited data exist regarding volumetric trends and management of upper extremity emergencies during periods of social restriction and duress, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to study the effect of shelter-in-place orders on emergent operative upper extremity surgery. Methods All patients undergoing emergent and time-sensitive operations to the finger(s), hand, wrist and forearm were tracked over an equal number of days before and after shelter-in-place orders at two geographically distinct Level 1 trauma centers. Surgical volume and resources, patient demographics, and injury patterns were compared before and after official shelter-in-place orders. Results Fifty-eight patients underwent time-sensitive or emergent operations. The mean patient age was 42 years with mean injury severity score (ISS) of 9 and median ASA score of 2. There was a 40% increase in volume after shelter-in-place orders, averaging 1.4 cases per day. Indications for surgery included high-energy closed fracture (60%), traumatic nerve injury (19%), severe soft tissue infection (15%), and revascularization of the arm, hand or digit(s) (15%). High-risk behavior, defined as lawlessness, assault, and high-speed auto accidents, was associated with a significantly greater proportion of operations after shelter-in-place orders (40% vs 12.5%, p<0.05). Each institution dedicated an average of three inpatient beds and one ICU capable bed to upper extremity care daily. Resources utilized included an average of 115 minutes of daily operating room time and 8 operating room staff/personnel per case. Conclusions Hand and upper extremity operative volume increased after shelter-in-place orders at two major Level 1 trauma centers across the country, demanding considerable hospital resources. The rise in volume was associated with an increase in high-risk behavior. Type of Study/Level of Evidence Therapeutic, Level IV

CXC chemokines and antimicrobial peptides in rhinovirus‐induced experimental asthma exacerbations

RATIONALE: Rhinoviruses (RVs) are the major triggers of asthma exacerbations. We have shown previously that lower respiratory tract symptoms, airflow obstruction, and neutrophilic airway inflammation were increased in experimental RV‐induced asthma exacerbations. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that neutrophil‐related CXC chemokines and antimicrobial peptides are increased and related to clinical, virologic, and pathologic outcomes in RV‐induced exacerbations of asthma. METHODS: Protein levels of antimicrobial peptides (SLPI, HNP 1–3, elafin, and LL‐37) and neutrophil chemokines (CXCL1/GRO‐α, CXCL2/GRO‐β, CXCL5/ENA‐78, CXCL6/GCP‐2, CXCL7/NAP‐2, and CXCL8/IL‐8) were determined in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of 10 asthmatics and 15 normal controls taken before, at day four during and 6 weeks post‐experimental infection. RESULTS: BAL HNP 1–3 and Elafin were higher, CXCL7/NAP‐2 was lower in asthmatics compared with controls at day 4 (P = 0.035, P = 0.048, and P = 0.025, respectively). BAL HNP 1–3 and CXCL8/IL‐8 were increased during infection (P = 0.003 and P = 0.011, respectively). There was a trend to increased BAL neutrophils at day 4 compared with baseline (P = 0.076). BAL HNP 1–3 was positively correlated with BAL neutrophil numbers at day 4. There were no correlations between clinical parameters and HNP1–3 or IL‐8 levels. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that RV infection in asthma leads to increased release of CXCL8/IL‐8, attracting neutrophils into the airways where they release HNP 1–3, which further enhances airway neutrophilia. Strategies to inhibit CXCL8/IL‐8 may be useful in treatment of virus‐induced asthma exacerbations.

Comparing Human Metapneumovirus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus: Viral Co-Detections, Genotypes and Risk Factors for Severe Disease

BACKGROUND: It is unclarified as to whether viral co-detection and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) genotypes relate to clinical manifestations in children with HMPV and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), and if the clinical course and risk factors for severe LRTI differ between HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). METHODS: We prospectively enrolled hospitalized children aged <16 years with LRTI from 2006 to 2015. Children were clinically examined, and nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed using semi-quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction tests for HMPV, RSV and 17 other pathogens. HMPV-positive samples were genotyped. RESULTS: A total of 171 children had HMPV infection. HMPV-infected children with single virus (n = 106) and co-detections (n = 65) had similar clinical manifestations. No clinical differences were found between HMPV genotypes A (n = 67) and B (n = 80). The HMPV-infected children were older (median 17.2 months) than RSV-infected children (median 7.3 months, n = 859). Among single virus-infected children, no differences in age-adjusted LRTI diagnoses were found between HMPV and RSV. Age was an important factor for disease severity among single virus-infected children, where children <6 months old with HMPV had a milder disease than those with RSV, while in children 12–23 months old, the pattern was the opposite. In multivariable logistic regression analysis for each virus type, age ≥12 months (HMPV), and age <6 months (RSV), prematurity, ≥1 chronic disease and high viral loads of RSV, but not high HMPV viral loads, were risk factors for severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized children with LRTI, HMPV manifests independently of viral co-detections and HMPV genotypes. Disease severity in HMPV- and RSV-infected children varies in relation to age. A history of prematurity and chronic disease increases the risk of severe LRTI among HMPV- and RSV-infected children.

C-type lectin LSECtin interacts with DC-SIGNR and is involved in hepatitis C virus binding

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver disease. However, the detailed mechanism underlying hepatocyte infection with HCV is not yet completely understood. We previously identified a novel C-type lectin—LSECtin predominantly expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Here we demonstrate that LSECtin can interact with two HCV receptors, DC-SIGNR and CD81, through its central ectodomain. Furthermore, cells expressing LSECtin specifically can be attached by the naturally occurring HCV in the sera of infected individuals. This binding was found to be mediated by the HCV E2 glycoprotein and could be efficiently inhibited by EGTA but not by mannan treatment. The present study suggests that LSECtin interaction with DC-SIGNR might contribute to HCV binding to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11010-009-0056-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Negatively charged residues in the endodomain are critical for specific assembly of spike protein into murine coronavirus

Abstract Coronavirus spike (S) protein assembles into virions via its carboxy-terminus, which is composed of a transmembrane domain and an endodomain. Here, the carboxy-terminal charge-rich motif in the endodomain was verified to be critical for the specificity of S assembly into mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Recombinant MHVs exhibited a range of abilities to accommodate the homologous S endodomains from the betacoronaviruses bovine coronavirus and human SARS-associated coronavirus, the alphacoronavirus porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and the gammacoronavirus avian infectious bronchitis virus respectively. Interestingly, in TGEV endodomain chimeras the reverting mutations resulted in stronger S incorporation into virions, and a net gain of negatively charged residues in the charge-rich motif accounted for the improvement. Additionally, MHV S assembly could also be rescued by the acidic carboxy-terminal domain of the nucleocapsid protein. These results indicate an important role for negatively charged endodomain residues in the incorporation of MHV S protein into assembled virions.

Nuclear proteins hijacked by mammalian cytoplasmic plus strand RNA viruses

Abstract Plus strand RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm face challenges in supporting the numerous biosynthetic functions required for replication and propagation. Most of these viruses are genetically simple and rely heavily on co-opting cellular proteins, particularly cellular RNA-binding proteins, into new roles for support of virus infection at the level of virus-specific translation, and building RNA replication complexes. In the course of infectious cycles many nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling proteins of mostly nuclear distribution are detained in the cytoplasm by viruses and re-purposed for their own gain. Many mammalian viruses hijack a common group of the same factors. This review summarizes recent gains in our knowledge of how cytoplasmic RNA viruses use these co-opted host nuclear factors in new functional roles supporting virus translation and virus RNA replication and common themes employed between different virus groups.

Maternal, neonatal, and child health in southeast Asia: towards greater regional collaboration

Although maternal and child mortality are on the decline in southeast Asia, there are still major disparities, and greater equity is key to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. We used comparable cross-national data sources to document mortality trends from 1990 to 2008 and to assess major causes of maternal and child deaths. We present inequalities in intervention coverage by two common measures of wealth quintiles and rural or urban status. Case studies of reduction in mortality in Thailand and Indonesia indicate the varying extents of success and point to some factors that accelerate progress. We developed a Lives Saved Tool analysis for the region and for country subgroups to estimate deaths averted by cause and intervention. We identified three major patterns of maternal and child mortality reduction: early, rapid downward trends (Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand); initially high declines (sustained by Vietnam but faltering in the Philippines and Indonesia); and high initial rates with a downward trend (Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar). Economic development seems to provide an important context that should be coupled with broader health-system interventions. Increasing coverage and consideration of the health-system context is needed, and regional support from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations can provide increased policy support to achieve maternal, neonatal, and child health goals.

Long‐term surveillance of bat coronaviruses in Korea: Diversity and distribution pattern

Bats harbour diverse coronaviruses (CoVs), some of which are associated with zoonotic infections, as well as inter‐species transmission. In this study, a total of 512 bat faecal samples from the bat habitats at different geographical locations in South Korea were investigated between 2016 and 2019. Seventy‐eight samples were positive for coronaviruses (15.2%), comprising 68 alphacoronaviruses (13.3%) and 10 betacoronaviruses (2.0%). The positive rates tended to increase during the awakening (April) period. Notably, betacoronaviruses were only found in the site where Rhinolophus ferrumequinum was the major species of bats, and were related to SARS‐ and MERS‐related CoVs identified in China and South Korea, respectively. No betacoronaviruses were closely related to SARS‐CoV‐2 in this study. Alphacoronaviruses were detected in the sites where Hypsugo alaschanicus, Miniopterus fuliginosus, Miniopterus schreibersii, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Myotis bombinus, Myotis macrodactylus and Myotis petax were found to be the major bat species. Furthermore, alphacoronaviruses had higher genetic diversity than betacoronaviruses and had a wider distribution in Korea. Considering that different bat species are co‐roosting in crowded conditions in the same habitat, the diverse coronaviruses in Korean bats are likely to undergo cross‐species transmission events due to the richness in host species. Therefore, continuous monitoring should be performed, especially at the awakening time of the hibernating bats in the habitats where diverse bat species co‐roost, to better understand the evolution of coronaviruses in bats.

Effect of Colchicine vs Standard Care on Cardiac and Inflammatory Biomarkers and Clinical Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized With Coronavirus Disease 2019: The GRECCO-19 Randomized Clinical Trial

IMPORTANCE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has evolved into a global pandemic. Low-dose colchicine combines anti-inflammatory action with a favorable safety profile. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of treatment with colchicine on cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial (the Greek Study in the Effects of Colchicine in COVID-19 Complications Prevention), 105 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were randomized in a 1:1 allocation from April 3 to April 27, 2020, to either standard medical treatment or colchicine with standard medical treatment. The study took place in 16 tertiary hospitals in Greece. INTERVENTION: Colchicine administration (1.5-mg loading dose followed by 0.5 mg after 60 min and maintenance doses of 0.5 mg twice daily) with standard medical treatment for as long as 3 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end points were (1) maximum high-sensitivity cardiac troponin level; (2) time for C-reactive protein to reach more than 3 times the upper reference limit; and (3) time to deterioration by 2 points on a 7-grade clinical status scale, ranging from able to resume normal activities to death. Secondary end points were (1) the percentage of participants requiring mechanical ventilation, (2) all-cause mortality, and (3) number, type, severity, and seriousness of adverse events. The primary efficacy analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: A total of 105 patients were evaluated (61 [58.1%] men; median [interquartile range] age, 64 [54-76] years) with 50 (47.6%) randomized to the control group and 55 (52.4%) to the colchicine group. Median (interquartile range) peak high-sensitivity cardiac troponin values were 0.0112 (0.0043-0.0093) ng/mL in the control group and 0.008 (0.004-0.0135) ng/mL in the colchicine group (P = .34). Median (interquartile range) maximum C-reactive protein levels were 4.5 (1.4-8.9) mg/dL vs 3.1 (0.8-9.8) mg/dL (P = .73), respectively. The clinical primary end point rate was 14.0% in the control group (7 of 50 patients) and 1.8% in the colchicine group (1 of 55 patients) (odds ratio, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.01-0.96; P = .02). Mean (SD) event-free survival time was 18.6 (0.83) days the in the control group vs 20.7 (0.31) in the colchicine group (log rank P = .03). Adverse events were similar in the 2 groups, except for diarrhea, which was more frequent with colchicine group than the control group (25 patients [45.5%] vs 9 patients [18.0%]; P = .003). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, participants who received colchicine had statistically significantly improved time to clinical deterioration. There were no significant differences in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin or C-reactive protein levels. These findings should be interpreted with caution.

Chloroquine Inhibits Dengue Virus Type 2 Replication in Vero Cells but Not in C6/36 Cells

Dengue viruses are the most important arthropod-borne viruses in terms of morbidity and mortality in the world. Since there is no dengue vaccine available for human use, we have set out to investigate the use of chloroquine as an antiviral drug against dengue. Chloroquine, an amine acidotropic drug known to affect intracellular exocytic pathways by increasing endosomal pH, was used in the in vitro treatment of Vero and C6/36 cells infected with dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2). Real-time RT-PCR and plaque assays were used to quantify the DENV-2 load in infected Vero and C6/36 cells after chloroquine treatment. Our results showed that a dose of 50 μg/ml of chloroquine was not toxic to the cells and induced a statistically significant inhibition of virus production in infected Vero cells when compared to untreated cells. In C6/36 cells, chloroquine does not induce a statistically significant difference in viral replication when compared to untreated cells, showing that this virus uses an unlikely pathway of penetration in these cells, and results were also confirmed by the plaque assay (PFU). These data suggest that the inhibition of virus infection induced by chloroquine is due to interference with acidic vesicles in mammalian cells.

Targeted Deletion of FGL2 Leads to Increased Early Viral Replication and Enhanced Adaptive Immunity in a Murine Model of Acute Viral Hepatitis Caused by LCMV WE

Mounting effective innate and adaptive immune responses are critical for viral clearance and the generation of long lasting immunity. It is known that production of inhibitory factors may result in the inability of the host to clear viruses, resulting in chronic viral persistence. Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) has been identified as a novel effector molecule of CD4(+)CD25(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells that inhibits immune activity by binding to FCγRIIB expressed primarily on antigen presenting cells (APC). In this study, we show that infection of mice with Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus WE (LCMV WE) leads to increased plasma levels of FGL2, which were detected as early as 2 days post-infection (pi) and persisted until day 50 pi. Mice deficient in FGL2 (fgl2(−/−)) had increased viral titers of LCMV WE in the liver early p.i but cleared the virus by day 12 similar to wild type mice. Dendritic cells (DC) isolated from the spleens of LCMV WE infected fgl2(−/−) had increased expression of the DC maturation markers CD80 and MHC Class II compared to wild type (fgl2(+/+)). Frequencies of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells producing IFNγ in response to ex vivo peptide re-stimulation isolated from the spleen and lymph nodes were also increased in LCMV WE infected fgl2 (−/−) mice. Increased frequencies of CD8(+) T cells specific for LCMV tetramers GP(33) and NP(396) were detected within the liver of fgl2(−/−) mice. Plasma from fgl2(−/−) mice contained higher titers of total and neutralizing anti-LCMV antibody. Enhanced anti-viral immunity in fgl2(−/−) mice was associated with increased levels of serum alanine transaminase (ALT), hepatic necrosis and inflammation following LCMV WE infection. These data demonstrate that targeting FGL2 leads to early increased viral replication but enhanced anti-viral adaptive T & B cell responses. Targeting FGL2 may enhance the efficacy of current anti-viral therapies for hepatotropic viruses.

Free ureteral replacement in rats: regeneration of ureteral wall components in the acellular matrix graft

Abstract Objectives To evaluate ureteral replacement by a free homologous graft of acellular matrix in a rat model. Methods In 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats, a 0.3 to 0.8-cm midsegment of the left ureter was resected and replaced with an acellular matrix graft of equal length placed on a polyethylene stent. The animals were killed at varying intervals, and the grafted specimens were prepared for light and electron microscopy. Results In all animals, the acellular matrix graft remained in its original position without evidence of incrustation or infection, and histologic examination showed complete epithelialization and progressive infiltration by vessels. At 10 weeks, smooth muscle fibers were observed; at 12 weeks, nerve fibers were first detected; at 4 months, smooth muscle cells had assumed regular configuration. Conclusions The ureteral acellular matrix graft appears to promote the regeneration of all ureteral wall components.

Infective disorders of the gastrointestinal tract

Gastrointestinal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Infectious organisms are often recovered by microbiological methods, but surgical pathologists may play a very valuable role in diagnosis. This review will focus on infective disorders of the gastrointestinal tract with an emphasis on enterocolitides caused by food‐ and water‐borne pathogens. Diagnostic histological features of selected enteric infections will be emphasized, including those that mimic other inflammatory conditions of the gut (such as ischaemia or idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease), along with available diagnostic methods that can aid in diagnosis.

Longitudinal study of bovine rotavirus group A in newborn calves from vaccinated and unvaccinated dairy herds

Reports of rotavirus excretion in calves usually result from cross-sectional studies, and in face of the conflicting results regarding protection of calves born to vaccinated dams against diarrhea, the aim of the present study was to evaluate rotavirus excretion in dairy calves born to vaccinated or unvaccinated dams, to identify the genotypes of bovine rotavirus group A (RVA) strains isolated from these animals as well as to investigate characteristics of the disease in naturally occurring circumstances throughout the first month of life. Five hundred fifty-two fecal samples were taken from 56 calves, 28 from each farm and, in the vaccinated herd, 11/281 samples (3.91%) taken from six different calves tested positive for RVA while in the unvaccinated herd, 3/271 samples (1.11%) taken from 3 different calves tested positive. The genotyping of the VP7 genes showed 91.2% nucleotide sequence identity to G6 genotype (NCDV strain), and for the VP4 gene, strains from the vaccinated herd were 96.6% related to B223 strain, while strains from the unvaccinated herd were 88% related to P[5] genotype (UK strain). Genotypes found in this study were G6P[11] in the vaccinated herd and G6P[5] in the unvaccinated herd. All calves infected with rotavirus presented an episode of diarrhea in the first month of life, and the discrepancy between the genotypes found in the commercial vaccine (G6P[1] and G10P[11]) and the rotavirus strains circulating in both vaccinated and unvaccinated herds show the importance of keeping constant surveillance in order to avoid potential causes of vaccination failure.

Coronavirus mapping in scientific publications: When science advances rapidly and collectively, is access to this knowledge open to society?

The COVID-19 pandemic is creating a global health emergency. Mapping this health emergency in scientific publications demands multiple approaches to obtain a picture as complete as possible. To progress in the knowledge of this pandemic and to control its effects, international collaborations between researchers are essentials, as well as having open and immediate access to scientific publications, what we called “coopetition”. Our main objectives are to identify the most productive countries in coronavirus publications, to analyse the international scientific collaboration on this topic, and to study the proportion and typology of open accessibility to these publications. We have analyzed 18,875 articles indexed in Web of Science. We performed the descriptive statistical analysis in order to explore the performance of the more prolific countries and organizations, as well as paying attention to the last 2 years. Registers have been analyzed separately via the VOSviewer software, drawing a network of links among countries and organizations to identify the starred countries and organizations, and the strongest links of the net. We have explored the capacity of researchers to generate scientific knowledge about a health crisis emergency, and their global capacity to collaborate among them in a global emergency. We consider that science is moving rapidly to find solutions to international health problems but access to this knowledge by society is not so quick due to several limitations (open access policies, corporate interests, etc.). We have observed that papers from China in the last 3 months (from January 2020 to March 2020) have a strong impact compared with papers published in years before. The United States and China are the major producers of documents of our sample, followed by all European countries, especially the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, and France. At the same time, the leading role of Saudi Arabia, Canada or South Korea should be noted, with a significant number of documents submitted but very different dynamics of international collaboration. The proportion of international collaboration is growing in all countries in 2019–2020, which contrasts with the situation of the last two decades. The organizations providing the most documents to the sample are mostly Chinese. The percentage of open access articles on coronavirus for the period 2001–2020 is 59.2% but if we focus in 2020 the figures increase up to 91.4%, due to the commitment of commercial publishers with the emergency.

Global aspects of viral glycosylation

Enveloped viruses encompass some of the most common human pathogens causing infections of different severity, ranging from no or very few symptoms to lethal disease as seen with the viral hemorrhagic fevers. All enveloped viruses possess an envelope membrane derived from the host cell, modified with often heavily glycosylated virally encoded glycoproteins important for infectivity, viral particle formation and immune evasion. While N-linked glycosylation of viral envelope proteins is well characterized with respect to location, structure and site occupancy, information on mucin-type O-glycosylation of these proteins is less comprehensive. Studies on viral glycosylation are often limited to analysis of recombinant proteins that in most cases are produced in cell lines with a glycosylation capacity different from the capacity of the host cells. The glycosylation pattern of the produced recombinant glycoproteins might therefore be different from the pattern on native viral proteins. In this review, we provide a historical perspective on analysis of viral glycosylation, and summarize known roles of glycans in the biology of enveloped human viruses. In addition, we describe how to overcome the analytical limitations by using a global approach based on mass spectrometry to identify viral O-glycosylation in virus-infected cell lysates using the complex enveloped virus herpes simplex virus type 1 as a model. We underscore that glycans often pay important contributions to overall protein structure, function and immune recognition, and that glycans represent a crucial determinant for vaccine design. High throughput analysis of glycosylation on relevant glycoprotein formulations, as well as data compilation and sharing is therefore important to identify consensus glycosylation patterns for translational applications.

Guillain Barre syndrome associated with COVID-19 infection: A case report

Abstract Novel outbreak with coronavirus 2019 began since 31 December 2019. Coronaviruses can cause multiple systemic infections that respiratory complications are the most obvious symptoms. In this report, we describe the symptoms of Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) in one infected patient with COVID-19, for the first time. We reported a 65-years- old male patient with complaints of acute progressive symmetric ascending quadriparesis. Two weeks prior to hospitalization, the patient suffered from cough, fever, and RT-PCR was reported positive for COVID-19 infection. The electrodiagnostic test showed that the patient is an AMSAN variant of GBS. COVID-19 stimulates inflammatory cells and produces various inflammatory cytokines and as a result, it creates immune-mediated processes. GBS is an immune-mediated disorder and molecular mimicry as a mechanism of autoimmune disorder plays an important role in creating it. It is unclear whether COVID-19 induces the production of antibodies against specific gangliosides. Further investigations should be conducted about the mechanism of GBS in patients with COVID-19, in the future.

Detection of transmissible gastroenteritis virus by RT-PCR and differentiation from porcine respiratory coronavirus

Abstract An RT-PCR method was developed that amplified genetic material from the 5′ end of the S protein gene of both transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), but discriminated between the two by the size of the product generated. A number of restriction endonuclease enzymes were assessed for recognition of the amplicons so produced. The assay was shown to detect viral RNA from all of the 26 different TGEV and PRCV isolates examined, covering a period from 1946 to 1996. Detection of TGEV in clinical specimens was possible using a spin column method to extract RNA and sensitivity was compared to virus isolation and antigen detection ELISA. The method could provide a means of confirming positive results from immunological screening tests such as FAT and ELISA, reducing the need for virus isolation and convalescent serology.

Japanese encephalitis virus counteracts BST2 restriction via its envelope protein E

Abstract It has been well documented that BST2 restricts the release of enveloped viruses by cross-linking newly produced virions to the cell membrane. However, it is less clear whether and how BST2 inhibits the release of enveloped viruses which bud via the secretory pathway. Here, we demonstrated that BST2 restricts the release of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) whose budding occurs at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, and in turn, JEV infection downregulates BST2 expression. We further found that the JEV envelope protein E, but not other viral components, significantly downregulates BST2 with the viral protein M playing an auxiliary role in the process. Envelope protein E-mediated BST2 downregulation appears to undergo lysosomal degradation pathway. Additional study revealed that the transmembrane domain and the coiled-coil domain (CC) of BST2 are the target domains of viral protein E and that the N- and C-terminal membrane anchors and the CC domain of BST2 are essential for blocking JEV release. Our results together indicate that the release of enveloped viruses whose budding take place in an intracellular compartment can be restricted by BST2.

A Patient Self-collection Method for Longitudinal Monitoring of Respiratory Virus Infection in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients

BACKGROUND: Methods for the longitudinal study of respiratory virus infections are cumbersome and limit our understanding of the natural history of these infections in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility and patient acceptability of self-collected foam nasal swabs for detection of respiratory viruses in SOT recipients and to define the virologic and clinical course. STUDY DESIGN: We prospectively monitored the course of symptomatic respiratory virus infection in 18 SOT patients (14 lung, 3 liver, and 1 kidney) using patient self-collected swabs. RESULTS: The initial study sample was positive in 15 patients with the following respiratory viruses: rhinovirus (6), metapneumovirus (1), coronavirus (2), respiratory syncytial virus (2), parainfluenza virus (2), and influenza A virus (2). One hundred four weekly self-collected nasal swabs were obtained, with a median of 4 samples per patient (range 1–17). Median duration of viral detection was 21 days (range 4–77 days). Additional new respiratory viruses detected during follow-up of these 15 patients included rhinovirus (3), metapneumovirus (2), coronavirus (1), respiratory syncytial virus (1), parainfluenza virus (1), and adenovirus (1). Specimen collection compliance was good; 16/18 (89%) patients collected all required specimens and 79/86 (92%) follow-up specimens were obtained within the 7±3 day protocol-defined window. All participants agreed or strongly agreed that the procedure was comfortable, simple, and 13/14 (93%) were willing to participate in future studies using this procedure. CONCLUSION: Self-collected nasal swabs provide a convenient, feasible, and patient-acceptable methodology for longitudinal monitoring of upper respiratory virus infection in SOT recipients.

The interaction of nonstructural protein 9 with retinoblastoma protein benefits the replication of genotype 2 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in vitro

Abstract The nonstructural protein 9 (Nsp9) of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that plays a vital role in viral replication. This study first demonstrated that the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV interacted with cellular retinoblastoma protein (pRb), and Nsp9 co-localized with pRb in the cytoplasm of PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells and pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Next, the overexpression of truncated pRb was shown to inhibit the PRRSV replication and silencing the pRb gene could facilitate the PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells. Finally, the pRb level was confirmed to be down-regulated in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells, and Nsp9 was shown to promote the pRb degradation by proteasome pathway. These findings indicate that the interaction of Nsp 9 with pRb benefits the replication of genotype 2 PRRSV in vitro, helping to understand the roles of Nsp9 in the replication and pathogenesis of PRRSV.

Reorganization of the endoscopic activity of Cancer Institutes during phase II of the Covid-19 emergency

After the lockdown during the emergency phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have to deal with phase 2, a period of uncertain duration, with a controlled and progressive return to normalization, in which we need to reconcile our work and our movements with the presence of the virus on our territory. Digestive endoscopic activity is a high-risk transmission procedure for Covid-19. The measures put in place to protect healthcare personnel and patients are stressful and “time-consuming" and lead to a reduction in the number of endoscopic procedures that can be performed. In this scenario, the Oncological Institutes are forced to make a rigorous selection of patients to undergo endoscopic examinations and treatments, according to lists of exceptional priorities, in order to guarantee cancer patients and subjects at high risk of developing digestive tumors, a preferential diagnostic and therapeutic process, protected from contagion risks. For this purpose, cuts and postponing times of endoscopic performances are here proposed, which go beyond the guidelines of scientific societies and have little evidences in the literature. These changes should be applied limited to this exceptional period and in proportion to the capacity of each operating unit in order to meet the demands of the patients.

Effects of curcumin in treatment of experimental pulmonary fibrosis: A comparison with hydrocortisone

Abstract To compare curcumin with hydrocortisone for treating bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (BLMPF), four groups of rats were injected with 1.5mg/kg bleomycin intratracheally. Then the Group HC rats were treated with three injections of 2mg/kg hydrocortisone i.p.; Group CH and CL rats, respectively, were orally given 500 or 250mg/kg curcumin daily; and Group PC rats were given deionized water alone. After 28 days of treatment, lung samples were examined by H-E staining, Masson's staining and immunohistochemical analyses and pulmonary type I collagen (Col-I), inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) were determined by Western blotting and real-time RT PCR analyses. The results showed that (1) Group PC rats had histopathological characteristics of BLMPF with significant increase in their protein/mRNA expressions of Col-I (+114%/+173%), iNOS (+146%/+523%) and TGF-β1 (+476%/+527%) (P <0.01); (2) in Group HC, CH and CL rats, protein/mRNA expressions of Col-I (−39%/−52%, −31%/−57%, −33%/−58%), iNOS (−31%/−51%, −31%/−79%, −31%/−47%) and TGF-β1 (−64%/−78%, −75%/−74%, −81%/−79%) were significantly lower than Group PC (P <0.05); (3) except for levels of TGF-β1 protein, there was no significant difference among Group CH, CL and HC rats (P >0.05). It suggests that curcumin may play a similar role as hydrocortisone in preventing BLMPF.

An overview of coronaviruses including the SARS-2 coronavirus – Molecular biology, epidemiology and clinical implications

Abstract Coronavirus infections have emerged as epidemic and pandemic threats in last two decades. After the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, recently diagnosed novel betacoronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 has spread across 203 countries and territories in all 5 major continents. World Health Organization (WHO) declared this as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. Subsequently on February 11, 2020 a new name was given to this disease i.e. COVID-19 by an expert group from WHO. As of April 12, 2020, 10:00 CET, GMT+2:00, 1,696,588 confirmed cases and 105,952 confirmed deaths have been reported to the WHO. (Coronavirus disease 2019, situation report 83). It possibly originated from a small animal market in Wuhan, China. A cluster of patients were admitted with unusual pneumonia not responding to treatment in various hospitals. Epidemiological, genomic analysis and correlation with other coronaviruses led to the isolation of new coronavirus, closely resembling the bat coronaviruses, from such patients in Wuhan. They were identified as the SARS-CoV-2. This virus infection presents as influenza like illness in the affected people. Fever, cough, respiratory distress with fatigue, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are common symptoms seen in adults. This may progress on to respiratory distress, hypoxia, need for oxygen supplementation and ventilator support as seen in patients in the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic (2003) in Guangdong, China. The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-1 was less as compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and it was well controlled with good public health efforts. The present COVID-19 epidemic is still in the acceleration phase of 3 and 4 in various countries. Without any effective antiviral agents available at present, the need of the hour is early case detection, isolation of cases, use of good preventive care measures by the household contacts and in the hospital set up. The results of ongoing clinical trials on hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin alone or in combination and a new antiviral agent remdesivir may help to treat some of the infections. A need for effective vaccine is being seen an as good preventive strategy in this pandemic. However the results of clinical trials and incorporation of vaccines in public health programs is a long way to go.

Implications of COVID-19 in pediatric rheumatology

COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a global public health issue threatening millions of lives worldwide. Although the infection is mild in most of the affected individuals, it may cause severe clinical manifestations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or cytokine storm leading to death. Children are affected less, and most experience a milder disease. As rheumatologists, we deal with the uncontrolled response of the immune system, and most of the drugs we use are either immune modulators or immunosuppressants. Thus, the rheumatologists participate in the multidisciplinary management of COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, our patients with rheumatic diseases constitute a vulnerable group in this pandemic. In this review, a systematic literature search was conducted utilizing MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus databases, and 231 COVID-19 patients with rheumatic diseases have been identified. Only one of these patients was a child. Among these, 9 (3.9%) died due to COVID-19. In light of the current data, the aspects of COVID-19 resembling rheumatic diseases, the possible reasons for why children are affected less severely, the hypothetic role of available vaccines in preventing COVID-19, the unique position of patients with rheumatic diseases in this pandemic, and the use of anti-rheumatic drugs in COVID-19 treatment are discussed. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1007/s00296-020-04612-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Marine lectins and their medicinal applications

Marine organisms have been extensively explored for the last several decades as potential sources of novel biologically active compounds, and extensive research has been conducted on lectins. Lectins derived from marine organisms are structurally diverse and also differ from those identified from terrestrial organisms. Marine lectins appear to be particularly useful in some biological applications. They seem to induce negligible immunogenicity because they have a relatively small size, are more stable due to extensive disulfide bridge formation, and have high specificity for complex glyco-conjugates and carbohydrates instead of simple sugars. It is clear that many of them have not yet been extensively studied when compared with their terrestrial counterparts. Marine lectins can be used to design and develop new potentially useful therapeutic agents. This review encompasses recent research on the isolation and identification of marine lectins with potential value in medicinal applications.

Functional analysis of the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) on virus-specific CD8+ T cells following coronavirus infection of the central nervous system

Abstract Intracranial infection of C57BL/6 mice with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) results in an acute encephalomyelitis followed by a demyelinating disease similar in pathology to the human disease multiple sclerosis (MS). T cells participate in both defense and disease progression following MHV infection. Expression of chemokine receptors on activated T cells is important in allowing these cells to traffic into and accumulate within the central nervous system (CNS) of MHV-infected mice. The present study evaluated the contributions of CCR5 to the activation and trafficking of virus-specific CD8+ T cells into the MHV-infected CNS mice. Comparable numbers of virus-specific CD8+ T cells derived from immunized CCR5+/+ or CCR5−/− mice were present within the CNS of MHV-infected RAG1−/− mice following adoptive transfer, indicating that CCR5 is not required for trafficking of these cells into the CNS. RAG1−/− recipients of CCR5−/−-derived CD8+ T cells exhibited a modest, yet significant (P ≤ 0.05), reduction in viral burden within the brain which correlated with increased CTL activity and IFN-γ expression. Histological analysis of RAG1−/− recipients of either CCR5+/+or CCR5−/−-derived CD8+ T cells revealed only focal areas of demyelination with no significant differences in white matter destruction. These data indicate that CCR5 signaling on CD8+ T cells modulates antiviral activities but is not essential for entry into the CNS.

Inhibition of replication and transcription activator and latency-associated nuclear antigen of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus by morpholino oligomers

Abstract Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). The KSHV replication and transcription activator (RTA) and latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) play key roles in activating KSHV lytic replication and maintaining KSHV latency, respectively. Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) are similar to short single-stranded DNA oligomers, but possess a modified backbone that confers highly specific binding and resistance to nucleases. In this study, RTA and LANA mRNA in PEL cells were targeted by antisense peptide-conjugated PMO (P-PMO) in an effort to suppress KSHV replication. Highly efficient P-PMO uptake by PEL cells was observed. Treatment of PEL cells with a RTA P-PMO (RP1) reduced RTA expression in a dose-dependent and sequence-specific manner, and also caused a significant decrease in several KSHV early and late gene products, including vIL-6, vIRF-1, and ORF-K8.1A. KSHV viral DNA levels were reduced both in cells and culture supernatants of RP1 P-PMO-treated cells, indicating that KSHV lytic replication was suppressed. Treatment of BCBL-1 cells with P-PMO against LANA resulted in a reduction of LANA expression. Cell viability assays detected no cytotoxicity from P-PMO alone, within the concentration range used for the experiments in this study. These results suggest that RP1 P-PMO can specifically block KSHV replication, and further study is warranted.

8 INFECTIOUS DISEASES

Publisher Summary The emergence of new pathogens, or the concern about bioterrorism, has brought an added urgency to the development of more efficient and rapid methods to detect pathogens and predict their potential virulence. Till date, DNA testing in microbiology has been directed predominantly to the detection of organisms that are difficult to culture in vitro, or for various reasons the growth is unlikely. DNA analysis can be used successfully in infections in which there is a mix of pathogens. Apart from the straightforward diagnostic applications, DNA microbiological testing has been used to detect antimicrobial resistance or toxigenic forms of E. coli. More recently, the availability of DNA technology to quantitate HCV and HIV has been useful in planning and monitoring treatment. The pathogenesis of many infections, particularly viral ones, can also be realized from experimental strategies based on light and electron microscopy, cell culture and immunoassay. The advantages that are provided by DNA techniques include the ability to detect latent (non-replicating) viruses and to localize their genomes to nuclear or cytoplasmic regions within cells. Nucleic acid probe techniques (NAT) can also be manipulated to enable a broad spectrum of serotypes to be detectable. This is particularly valuable in those emerging infections where the underlying serotypes are unknown.

A tertiary center experience of multiple myeloma patients with COVID-19: lessons learned and the path forward

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in over 100,000 deaths in the United States. Our institution has treated over 2,000 COVID-19 patients during the pandemic in New York City. The pandemic directly impacts cancer patients and the organization of cancer care. Mount Sinai Hospital has a large and diverse multiple myeloma population. Here, we report the characteristics of COVID-19 infection and serological response in multiple myeloma (MM) patients in a large tertiary care institution in New York. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of a cohort of 58 patients with a plasma cell disorder (54 MM, 4 smoldering MM) who developed COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020. We report epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics including persistence of viral detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, treatments initiated, and outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 58 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 36 were hospitalized and 22 were managed at home. The median age was 67 years; 52% of patients were male and 63% were non-white. Hypertension (64%), hyperlipidemia (62%), obesity (37%), diabetes mellitus (28%), chronic kidney disease (CKD, 24%) and lung disease (21%) were the most common comorbidities. In the total cohort, 14 patients (24%) died. Older age (>70 years), male sex and cardiovascular risk were significantly (p<0.05) associated with hospitalization. Among hospitalized patients, laboratory findings demonstrated elevation of traditional inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, D-dimer) and a significant (p<0.05) association between elevated inflammatory markers, severe hypogammaglobulinemia, non-white race, and mortality. Ninety-six percent (22/23) of patients developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at a median of 32 days after initial diagnosis. Median time to PCR negativity was 43 (range 19-68) days from initial positive PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Drug exposure and MM disease status at the time of contracting COVID-19 had no bearing on patient outcome. Mounting a severe inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2, and severe hypogammaglobulinemia were associated with higher mortality. These findings pave a path to identification of vulnerable patients who need early intervention to improve outcome of myeloma patients in future outbreaks of COVID-19. The majority of myeloma patients mounted a specific antibody response to SARS-CoV-2.

Rapid Implementation of an Adult COVID-19 Unit in a Children’s Hospital

Objective To describe the rapid implementation of an adult coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) unit using pediatric physician and nurse providers in a children’s hospital and to examine the characteristics and outcomes of the first 100 adult patients admitted. Study design We describe our approach to surge-in-place at a children’s hospital to meet the local demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of re-deploying pediatric providers to work with internist-led teams throughout a medical center, pediatric physicians and nurses organized and staffed a 40-bed adult COVID-19 treatment unit within a children’s hospital. We adapted internal medicine protocols, developed screening criteria to select appropriate patients for admission, and reorganized staffing and equipment to accommodate adult COVID-19 patients. We used patient counts and descriptive statistics to report sociodemographic, system, and clinical outcomes. Results The median patient age was 46 years; 69% were male. On admission, 78 (78%) required oxygen supplementation. During hospitalization, 13 (13%) eventually were intubated. Of the first 100 patients, 14 are still admitted to a medical unit, 6 are in the intensive care unit, 74 have been discharged, 4 died after transfer to the ICU, and 2 died on the unit. The median length of stay for discharged or deceased patients was 4 days (IQR 2,7). Conclusions Our pediatric team screened, admitted, and cared for hospitalized adults by leveraging the familiarity of our system, adaptability of our staff, and high-quality infrastructure. This experience may be informative for other healthcare systems that will be re-deploying pediatric providers and nurses to address a regional COVID-19 surge elsewhere.

Chapter 21 Marc Lalonde, the Health Field Concept and Health Promotion

Abstract During the 20th century, public health evolved with increasing capacity for disease prevention as scientific breakthroughs occurred in microbiology, immunology, nutrition, and other sciences. Disease-control advanced and new epidemiologic evidence identified risk factors for the growing burden of noncommunicable diseases such as the cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and others. Medical care also improved and became more accessible through health insurance systems both in the private and governmental sector. Health systems became more combined public–private endeavors, with health insurance for medical- and hospital-care taking center stage. Epidemiology blossomed as a science following World War II, producing vital insights and evidence of contributory factors to noncommunicable diseases. In the 1960s the cumulative evidence of smoking as a direct cause of lung cancer and heart disease was identified as a major public health challenge. These relationships became clear and increasingly accepted after the US Surgeon General’s Report in 1964. In 1974, Hon. Marc Lalonde, Canada’s Minister of National Health and Welfare issued the book A New Perspective on the Health of Canadians, which identified genetic, environmental, personal lifestyle, and medical care as equally important issues in personal and population health. New Perspectives led to the “Ottawa Charter” in 1986 which defined health promotion and has become a vital issue in public health. The health promotion movement immediately found a crucial role in smoking reduction and diet change to deal with the pandemics of lung cancer and heart disease. In the 1980s health promotion found itself at the frontline dealing with the HIV pandemic when there were no biomedical means to stem the pandemic of death from AIDS. Public health had to find new and effective instruments for disease control. A renewed emphasis on social inequalities in health in the 21st century exemplified in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) addressed vulnerable populations with linked targets of reducing poverty, promoting education and gender equality, safer environment, and biomedical disease-control measures as global health policy. This more holistic approach to population health has become a leading element in modern public health largely based on the intellectual contribution of Marc Lalonde.

The D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein reduces S1 shedding and increases infectivity

SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolates encoding a D614G mutation in the viral spike (S) protein predominate over time in locales where it is found, implying that this change enhances viral transmission. We therefore compared the functional properties of the S proteins with aspartic acid (S(D614)) and glycine (S(G614)) at residue 614. We observed that retroviruses pseudotyped with S(G614) infected ACE2-expressing cells markedly more efficiently than those with S(D614). This greater infectivity was correlated with less S1 shedding and greater incorporation of the S protein into the pseudovirion. Similar results were obtained using the virus-like particles produced with SARS-CoV-2 M, N, E, and S proteins. However, S(G614) did not bind ACE2 more efficiently than S(D614), and the pseudoviruses containing these S proteins were neutralized with comparable efficiencies by convalescent plasma. These results show S(G614) is more stable than S(D614), consistent with epidemiological data suggesting that viruses with S(G614) transmit more efficiently.

Reverse Transcription Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Assay for the Detection of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus

The emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the eastern Mediterranean and imported cases to Europe has alerted public health authorities. Currently, detection of MERS-CoV in patient samples is done by real-time RT-PCR. Samples collected from suspected cases are sent to highly-equipped centralized laboratories for screening. A rapid point-of-care test is needed to allow more widespread mobile detection of the virus directly from patient material. In this study, we describe the development of a reverse transcription isothermal Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RT-RPA) assay for the identification of MERS-CoV. A partial nucleocapsid gene RNA molecular standard of MERS-coronavirus was used to determine the assay sensitivity. The isothermal (42°C) MERS-CoV RT-RPA was as sensitive as real-time RT-PCR (10 RNA molecules), rapid (3-7 minutes) and mobile (using tubescanner weighing 1kg). The MERS-CoV RT-RPA showed cross-detection neither of any of the RNAs of several coronaviruses and respiratory viruses affecting humans nor of the human genome. The developed isothermal real-time RT-RPA is ideal for rapid mobile molecular MERS-CoV monitoring in acute patients and may also facilitate the search for the animal reservoir of MERS-CoV.

COVID‐19 PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL DISTANCING IN PRISONS

In the context of the Covid‐19 pandemic, how can the early release of prisoners, requested by the World Health Organization, members of civil society and non‐governmental organizations, be considered a ‘humane’ decision? In this article, the author examines the Portuguese context, discussing the ways that the urgency and fear of contagion highlighted, once more, the inability of prisons to cope with the needs of both those they confine and those they intend to protect.

Chapter 5 John Snow, Cholera, the Broad Street Pump; Waterborne Diseases Then and Now

Abstract Cholera was a major global scourge in the 19th century, with frequent large-scale epidemics in European cities primarily originating in the Indian subcontinent. John Snow conducted pioneering investigations on cholera epidemics in England and particularly in London in 1854 in which he demonstrated that contaminated water was the key source of the epidemics. His thorough investigation of an epidemic in the Soho district of London led to his conclusion that contaminated water from the Broad Street pump was the source of the disease and, consequently, the removal of the handle led to cessation of the epidemic. He further studied cholera in London homes that were receiving water from two water supply systems; one from the sewage contaminated portion of the Thames River and the other that drew its water upstream from an uncontaminated part of the river. Rates of infection among clients of the distribution system drawing contaminated water far exceeded the, rates among those served by the company whose water intake was from above the contaminated section of the river. This demonstration reinforced the goals of the sanitation movement, which developed sewage drainage systems and water purification systems in cities and towns in the following decades, therewith vastly reducing the threats of cholera, typhoid and many other waterborne diseases. Despite progress being made globally, the public health problems of waterborne disease, including cholera, are by no means gone today, even in high-income countries. The tragic introduction of cholera after the earthquake devastation in Haiti in 2010 resulted in many thousands of cases and deaths from cholera indicating the still-present dangers of diseases spread into disaster situations. Cholera and other waterborne diseases remain some of the heaviest burdens of disease and death in low-income countries, especially after natural disasters or warfare as in Yemen in 2017 and are continuing challenges for global health.

Transforming ophthalmic education into virtual learning during COVID-19 pandemic: a global perspective

OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has imposed measures of social distancing and barriers in delivery of “in person” education. Institutions, involved in training the next generation of ophthalmologists, are using alternative teaching methods to maintain the standard of education. METHODS: We conducted a worldwide survey among physicians, who are actively involved in Ophthalmology-related education, between 3 and 14 April 2020. The expert survey, developed on the basis of literature search and focus group discussions, comprised 23 questions addressing the use of e-learning in Ophthalmology during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 321 participants from both academic and non-academic institutions worldwide, with variable practice experience and expertise, completed the survey. Before the pandemic, the majority of participants used traditional training modalities, including lectures, grand rounds and journal clubs, and 48% did not use any e-learning. There was a statistically significant increase in the use of all e-learning alternatives during the pandemic (p < 0.001), associated mainly with the availability of e-learning facilities (p < 0.001) and the academic character of institutions (p < 0.001). Zoom® was recognized as the mostly used platform for virtual teaching. Although theoretical teaching may take place, the surgical training of residents/fellows was dramatically reduced. The latter was significantly associated with participants’ perspectives about teaching practices (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic imposed great challenges in the educational field of Ophthalmology. The experience related to virtual training in Ophthalmology, gained during the pandemic, may change the traditional teaching practices in the world and provide new educational opportunities.

MicroRNA Regulation of RNA Virus Replication and Pathogenesis

microRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that regulate many processes within a cell by manipulating protein levels through direct binding to mRNA and influencing translation efficiency, or mRNA abundance. Recent evidence demonstrates that miRNAs can also affect RNA virus replication and pathogenesis through direct binding to the RNA virus genome or through virus-mediated changes in the host transcriptome. Here, we review the current knowledge on the interaction between RNA viruses and cellular miRNAs. We also discuss how cell and tissue-specific expression of miRNAs can directly affect viral pathogenesis. Understanding the role of cellular miRNAs during viral infection may lead to the identification of novel mechanisms to block RNA virus replication or cell-specific regulation of viral vector targeting.

Accelerating supply chains with Ant Colony Optimization across a range of hardware solutions

Ant Colony algorithm has been applied to various optimisation problems, however, most of the previous work on scaling and parallelism focuses on Travelling Salesman Problems (TSPs). Although useful for benchmarks and new idea comparison, the algorithmic dynamics do not always transfer to complex real-life problems, where additional meta-data is required during solution construction. This paper explores how the benchmark performance differs from real-world problems in the context of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and demonstrate that in order to generalise the findings, the algorithms have to be tested on both standard benchmarks and real-world applications. ACO and its scaling dynamics with two parallel ACO architectures – Independent Ant Colonies (IAC) and Parallel Ants (PA). Results showed that PA was able to reach a higher solution quality in fewer iterations as the number of parallel instances increased. Furthermore, speed performance was measured across three different hardware solutions – 16 core CPU, 68 core Xeon Phi and up to 4 Geforce GPUs. State of the art, ACO vectorisation techniques such as SS-Roulette were implemented using C++ and CUDA. Although excellent for routing simple TSPs, it was concluded that for complex real-world supply chain routing GPUs are not suitable due to meta-data access footprint required. Thus, our work demonstrates that the standard benchmarks are not suitable for generalised conclusions.

The Contribution of Ageing to Hospitalisation Days in Hong Kong: A Decomposition Analysis

Background: Ageing has become a serious challenge in Hong Kong and globally. It has serious implications for health expenditure, which accounts for nearly 20% of overall government expenditure. Here we assess the contribution of ageing and related factors to hospitalisation days in Hong Kong. We used hospital discharge data from all publicly funded hospitals in Hong Kong between 2001 and 2012. Methods: A decomposition method was used to examine the factors that account for the change of total hospitalisation days during the two periods, 2001-2004 and 2004-2012. The five factors include two demographic factors – population size and age-gender composition – and three service components – hospital discharge rate, number of discharge episodes per patient, and average length of stay (LOS) – which are all measured at age-gender group level. In order to assess the health cost burden in the future, we also project the total hospitalisation days up to 2041, for a range of scenarios. Results: During the decreasing period of hospitalisation days (2001-2004), the reduction of LOS contributed to about 60% of the reduction. For the period of increase (2004-2012), ageing is associated with an increase in total hospitalisation days of 1.03 million, followed by an increase in hospital discharge rates (0.67 million), an increase in the number of discharge episodes per patient (0.62 million), and population growth (0.43 million). The reduction of LOS has greatly offset these increases (-2.19 million days), and has become one of the most significant factors in containing the increasing number of hospitalisation days. Projected increases in total hospitalisation days under different scenarios have highlighted that the contribution of ageing will become even more prominent after 2022. Conclusion: Hong Kong is facing increasing healthcare burden caused by the rapid increase in demand for inpatient services due to ageing. Better management of inpatient services with the aim of increasing efficiency and reducing LOS, avoidable hospitalisation and readmission, without compromising patient satisfaction and quality of service, are crucial for containing the rapid and enormous increases in total hospitalisation days for Hong Kong. The results would be relevant to many rapidly ageing societies in this region.

PEACOCK: A Map-Based Multitype Infectious Disease Outbreak Information System

A map-based infectious disease outbreak information system, called PEACOCK, that provides three types of necessary infectious disease outbreak information is presented. The system first collects the infectious disease outbreak statistics from the government agencies and displays the number of infected people and infection indices on the map. Then, it crawls online news articles for each infectious disease and displays the number of mentions of each disease on the map. Users can also search for news articles regarding the disease. Finally, it retrieves the portal search query data and plots the graphs of the trends. It divides the risk into three levels (i.e., normal, caution, and danger) and visualizes them using different colors on the map. Users can access infectious disease outbreak information accurately and quickly using the system. As the system visualizes the information using both a map and various types of graphs, users can check the information at a glance. This system is in live at http://www.epidemic.co.kr/map.

Roles of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in immune regulation and immune diseases

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) play a vital role in protein synthesis by linking amino acids to their cognate transfer RNAs (tRNAs). This typical function has been well recognized over the past few decades. However, accumulating evidence reveals that ARSs are involved in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes apart from translation. Strikingly, certain ARSs are closely related to different types of immune responses. In this review, we address the infection and immune responses induced by pathogen ARSs, as well as the potential anti-infective compounds that target pathogen ARSs. Meanwhile, we describe the functional mechanisms of ARSs in the development of immune cells. In addition, we focus on the roles of ARSs in certain immune diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and tumor immunity. Although our knowledge of ARSs in the immunological context is still in its infancy, research in this field may provide new ideas for the treatment of immune-related diseases.

Bioproduction of ribavirin by green microbial biotransformation

Abstract Ribavirin is an antiviral compound widely used in Hepatitis C Virus therapy. Biotransformation of this nucleoside analogue using Escherichia coli ATCC 12407 as biocatalyst is herein reported. Reaction parameters such as microorganism amounts, substrate ratio and temperature were optimized reaching conversion yields of 86%. Biocatalyst stability was enhanced by immobilization in agarose matrix. This immobilized biocatalyst was able to be reused for more than 270h and could be stored during more than 4 months without activity loss. Batch and packed-bed reactors based on a stabilized biocatalyst were assayed for bioprocess scale-up. A continuous sustainable bioprocess was evaluated using a prototype packed-bed reactor, which allowed to produce 95mg of ribavirin. Finally, in this work an efficient green bioprocess for ribavirin bioproduction using a stabilized biocatalyst was developed.

Viruses and Bioterrorism ☆

Abstract The target for a terrorist attack with a viral agent can range from humans to animals and plants. However, the use of a viral agent may pose a challenge due to problems associated with acquisition, cultivation, and dissemination. Agricultural targets are of concern as they would require relatively little specialized expertise and technology and can have large economic consequences. Viral agents are prone to genetic variation and mutation, and can be manipulated or created in the laboratory. Unlike bacterial diseases, many of which are treatable with antimicrobials, there are fewer medical countermeasures to employ when dealing with viral infections.

Pathogenic characteristics of a QX-like infectious bronchitis virus strain SD in chickens exposed at different ages and protective efficacy of combining live homologous and heterologous vaccination

Continued reports of infections with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) variants have occurred since its first isolation in the 1930s. Currently, QX-like IBVs are the predominant circulating genotype around the world. Here, the pathogenicity of QX-like IBV strain SD was characterized in chickens at different ages of exposure to the virus, and the protection efficacy of available vaccine combinations against IBV was evaluated. The results revealed that QX-like IBV strain SD was severely pathogenic in chickens, causing respiratory, urinary and reproductive infections, irrespective of age, based on clinical observations, viral distribution in tissues and a ciliostasis study. Severe respiratory signs, tracheal cilia injury, nephritis and abnormal development of the oviduct and ovarian follicles were evident throughout the experiment. A challenge experiment demonstrated that the homologous QX vaccine showed superior protection efficacy compared with other available vaccines, confirming the importance of IBV vaccine seed homology against the circulating IBV strains. Our findings aid an understanding of the pathogenicity of QX-like IBVs that may help to further control the infection.

SARS: Systematic Review of Treatment Effects

BACKGROUND: The SARS outbreak of 2002–2003 presented clinicians with a new, life-threatening disease for which they had no experience in treating and no research on the effectiveness of treatment options. The World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel on SARS treatment requested a systematic review and comprehensive summary of treatments used for SARS-infected patients in order to guide future treatment and identify priorities for research. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In response to the WHO request we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on ribavirin, corticosteroids, lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), type I interferon (IFN), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and SARS convalescent plasma from both in vitro studies and in SARS patients. We also searched for clinical trial evidence of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Sources of data were the literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to February 2005. Data from publications were extracted and evidence within studies was classified using predefined criteria. In total, 54 SARS treatment studies, 15 in vitro studies, and three acute respiratory distress syndrome studies met our inclusion criteria. Within in vitro studies, ribavirin, lopinavir, and type I IFN showed inhibition of SARS-CoV in tissue culture. In SARS-infected patient reports on ribavirin, 26 studies were classified as inconclusive, and four showed possible harm. Seven studies of convalescent plasma or IVIG, three of IFN type I, and two of LPV/r were inconclusive. In 29 studies of steroid use, 25 were inconclusive and four were classified as causing possible harm. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an extensive literature reporting on SARS treatments, it was not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the SARS outbreak. Some may have been harmful. Clinical trials should be designed to validate a standard protocol for dosage and timing, and to accrue data in real time during future outbreaks to monitor specific adverse effects and help inform treatment.

CHAPTER 7 CELL-SURFACE ANTIGENS

Publisher Summary The cell surface is covered with protein molecules that are held in the membrane by hydrophobic transmembrane segments or glycosyl–phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. Antigens found on cell surfaces comprise not only those encoded by the cell itself but also the products of intracellular parasites. Soluble ligands may be bound to receptor structures on the cell membrane or lectin-like molecules bound to cell-surface carbohydrate structures. The molecules that form an integral part of the cell surface may be proteins, glycoproteins, or glycolipids. They subserve one of three major functions: adhesion, antigen recognition, or receptors for soluble mediators. However, many cell-surface molecules possess more than one function—for example, molecules involved in cell–cell or cell–extracellular matrix adhesion can also themselves be involved in signal transduction. The cell-surface antigens of leukocytes have been intensively studied because of ease of access to this cellular compartment.

Susceptibility to SARS coronavirus S protein-driven infection correlates with expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and infection can be blocked by soluble receptor

Abstract The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Here we show that ACE2 expression on cell lines correlates with susceptibility to SARS-CoV S-driven infection, suggesting that ACE2 is a major receptor for SARS-CoV. The soluble ectodomain of ACE2 specifically abrogated S-mediated infection and might therefore be exploited for the generation of inhibitors. Deletion of a major portion of the cytoplasmic domain of ACE2 had no effect on S-driven infection, indicating that this domain is not important for receptor function. Our results point to a central role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV infection and suggest a minor contribution of the cytoplasmic domain to receptor function.

Thermogravimetric analysis and kinetic study on pyrolysis of representative medical waste composition

Abstract To obtain detailed information on the pyrolysis characteristics, a thermogravimetric study on the pyrolysis of 14 typical medical waste compositions was carried out in thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) equipment using dynamic techniques in a stream of N2. An index representing pyrolysis reactivity of waste was presented. Kinetic parameters were obtained by Coats–Redfern method and used to model the TG curve. The results showed that: (a) Plastic, protein, cellulosic material, synthetic fibre, and rubber entered pyrolysis process in succession. (b) There was one decomposition stage in the pyrolysis of one-off medical glove, operating glove, cellulosic waste, absorbable catgut suture and adhesive plaster, while other components had two obvious weight loss stages. (c) The obtained apparent activation energy for second stage pyrolysis was comparably higher than that for first stage. (d) Each stage was controlled by only one kinetic mechanism, in which kinetic parameters were constant. (e) The degradation kinetics of medical waste may be affected by special physical and chemical treatment in the product manufacturing process. (f) Among 13 waste samples, the pyrolysis index of cellulosic matter was the highest, which indicated cellulosic matter had strong pyrolysis reactivity. (g) With increasing heating rate, TG curve and DTG peak shifted to high temperatures and main reaction interval of the sample became longer.

Coupling to the surface of liposomes alters the immunogenicity of hepatitis C virus-derived peptides and confers sterile immunity

Abstract We have previously demonstrated that antigens chemically coupled to the surface of liposomes consisting of unsaturated fatty acids were cross-presented by antigen presenting cells to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Liposomal form of immunodominant CTL epitope peptides derived from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus exhibited highly efficient antiviral CTL responses in immunized mice. In this study, we coupled 15 highly conserved immunodominant CTL epitope peptides derived from hepatitis C virus (HCV) to the surface of liposomes. We also emulsified the peptides in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant, and compared the immune responses of the two methods of presenting the peptides by cytotoxicity induction and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production by CD8+ T cells of the immunized mice. We noticed significant variations of the immunogenicity of each peptide between the two antigen delivery systems. In addition, the immunogenicity profiles of the peptides were also different from those observed in the mice infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing HCV proteins as previously reported. Induction of anti-viral immunity by liposomal peptides was tested by the challenge experiments using recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing corresponding HCV epitopes. One Db-restricted and three HLA-A*0201-restricted HCV CTL epitope peptides on the surface of liposomes were found to confer complete protection to immunized mice with establishment of long-term memory. Interestingly, their protective efficacy seemed to correlate with the induction of IFN-γ producing cells rather than the cytotoxicity induction suggesting that the immunized mice were protected through non-cytolytic mechanisms. Thus, these liposomal peptides might be useful as HCV vaccines not only for prevention but also for therapeutic use.

Discovering small-molecule therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly become a global health pandemic. The lack of effective treatments, coupled with its etiology, has resulted in more than 400,000 deaths at the time of writing. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is highly homologous to that of SARS-CoV, the causative agent behind the 2003 SARS outbreak. Based on prior reports, clinicians have pursued the off-label use of several antiviral drugs, while the scientific community has responded by seeking agents against traditional targets, especially viral proteases. However, several avenues remain unexplored, including disrupting E and M protein oligomerization, outcompeting host glycan–virus interactions, interfering with the heparan sulfate proteoglycans–virus interaction, and others. In this review, we highlight some of these opportunities while summarizing the drugs current in use against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).

Antiviral effect of amiloride on replication of foot and mouth disease virus in cell culture

Abstract Recently, amiloride was shown to potently suppress Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) replication. In the current study, we investigated whether amiloride could also exhibit antiviral activity against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), which belongs to the same family (Picornaviridae) as CVB3. We found that amiloride exerted antiviral activity in a dose-dependent manner against two strains of FMDV in IBRS-2 cells, with slight cytotoxicity at 1000 μM. Besides, amiloride did not inhibit the attachment and entry of FMDV in IBRS-2 cells, but prevented early viral replication. These data implied that amiloride could be a promising candidate for further research as a potential antiviral drug against FMDV infection.

Coronavirus as silent killer: recent advancement to pathogenesis, therapeutic strategy and future perspectives

The present outbreak associated with corona virus [CoVs] in China which is believed to be one of the massive eruptions towards mankind in 2019–2020. In the present scenario CoVs has been transmitted to the European and American regions through the travellers from wide spread countries like China and Japan. The viral disease is spreading through the contact in any form by the infected persons or patients and creating huge risk of mortality. CoVs are a single positive-sense RNA virus; mutation rates are higher than DNA viruses and indicate a more effective survival adaption mechanism. Human CoVs can cause common cold and influenza-like illness and a variety of severe acute respiratory disease such as pneumonia. Early in infection, CoVs infects epithelial cells, macrophages, T-cells, dendritic cells and also can affect the development and implantation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. It mainly produces the melanoma differentiation associated with protein-5, retinoic acid inducible gene-1 and endosomal toll-like receptor 3. How CoVs affects the function of the immune system is still unclear due to lack of this knowledge. No Food and Drug Administration approved treatment is available till date. In this review, we are tried to explore the epidemiology, pathogenesis and current treatment of CoVs infection. The promising therapeutics molecules against CoVs and future prospective have been also discussed which will be helpful for researchers to find out the new molecules for the treatment of CoVs disease.

Development of an efficient viral aerosol collector for higher sampling flow rate

Viral aerosol infection through cough generates large amounts of viral aerosol and can result in many adverse health effects such as influenza flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To characterize the coughed viral aerosol, the sampler needs to sample at higher flow rate and possess high physical collection efficiency as well as high viral preservation. However, most current inertia-based high flow bioaerosol samplers are not suited for viral aerosol sampling since the viability will be lost doing the sampling process. Current condensation growth methods only have good physical collection efficiency and viral preservation at low flow rate (< 10 LPM). In this study, we developed a viral aerosol sampling system using a cooler and steam-jet aerosol collector (SJAC) for bioaerosol collection for the first time. The system is based on mixing condensation growth method and has high viral preservation at a higher flow rate (12.5 LPM). We control the inlet aerosol flow temperature and the SJAC mixing reservoir temperature to improve the physical collection efficiency and viability preservation of the viral aerosol. Results indicate that the physical collection efficiency is 70–99% for aerosol 30–100 nm when the aerosol flow and mixing reservoir temperature was 19 and 50 °C, respectively. In addition, the system was 7 and 22 times more efficient for viability preservation of MS2 bacteriophage than the commonly used All Glass Impinger 30 (AGI-30) and BioSampler®, respectively. Finally, the system can be applied to sample at a lower concentration (10(5) PFU/m(3)), and results shows the system was 4.7 times more efficient for viability preservation than using AGI-30 alone. The developed viral collection system will improve our understanding of the characteristics of coughed aerosol and can be used for future evaluation of respiratory protective equipment and environmental sampling.

The Multifaceted Roles of Autophagy in Flavivirus-Host Interactions

Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process in which intracellular components are eliminated via lysosomal degradation to supply nutrients for organelle biogenesis and metabolic homeostasis. Flavivirus infections underlie multiple human diseases and thus exert an immense burden on public health worldwide. Mounting evidence indicates that host autophagy is subverted to modulate the life cycles of flaviviruses, such as hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus and Zika virus. The diverse interplay between autophagy and flavivirus infection not only regulates viral growth in host cells but also counteracts host stress responses induced by viral infection. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of autophagy in the flavivirus life cycle. We also discuss the impacts of virus-induced autophagy on the pathogeneses of flavivirus-associated diseases and the potential use of autophagy as a therapeutic target for curing flavivirus infections and related human diseases.

Norovirus disease: changing epidemiology and host susceptibility factors

Abstract Noroviruses cause the majority of acute viral gastroenteritis cases that occur worldwide. The increased recognition of noroviruses as the cause of outbreaks and sporadic disease is due to the recent availability of improved norovirus-specific diagnostics. Transmission of these viruses is facilitated by their high prevalence in the community, shedding of infectious virus particles from asymptomatic individuals and the high stability of the virus in the environment. Currently, the spectrum of clinical disease and the understanding of host susceptibility factors are changing. Cases of chronic norovirus gastroenteritis have been observed in transplant recipients and unusual clinical presentations have been recognized in otherwise healthy adults that are under physical stress. Recently, noroviruses were found to bind to gut-expressed carbohydrates, leading to a correlation between a person's genetically determined carbohydrate expression and their susceptibility to Norwalk virus infection. Greater community surveillance and further investigation of carbohydrate receptor-binding properties could provide further insights into norovirus transmission, susceptibility and pathogenesis, and should aid in developing vaccines and antiviral therapies for this common viral disease.

Characterization of a 105-kDa Polypeptide Encoded in Gene 1 of the Human Coronavirus HCV 229E

Abstract Gene 1 of the human coronavirus HCV 229E encompasses approximately 20.7 kb and contains two overlapping open reading frames, ORF 1a and ORF 1b. The downstream ORF 1b is expressed by a mechanism involving (−1) ribosomal frameshifting. Translation of mRNA 1, which is thought to be equivalent to the viral genomic RNA, results in the synthesis of two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. These polyproteins contain motifs characteristic of papain-like and 3C-like proteinases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicases, and metal-binding proteins. In this study, we have produced pp1ab-specific monoclonal antibodies and have used them to detect an intracellular, 105-kDa viral polypeptide that contains the putative RNA polymerase domain. Furthermore, usingtranscleavage assays with bacterially expressed HCV 229E 3C-like proteinase, we have demonstrated that the 105-kDa polypeptide is released from pp1ab by cleavage at the dipeptide bonds Gln-4068/Ser-4069 and Gln-4995/Ala-4996. These data contribute to the characterization of coronavirus 3C-like proteinase-mediated processing of pp1ab and provide the first identification of an HCV 229E ORF 1ab-encoded polypeptide in virus-infected cells.

Dynamics and orientation of a cationic antimicrobial peptide in two membrane-mimetic systems

Abstract In order to investigate the functional and structural properties of cationic α-helical peptides in two different membranes, we studied the 20-residue peptide maximin H6 in two membrane-mimetic systems by NMR spectroscopy using partially 15N-labeled peptide and paramagnetic relaxation enhancements. Maximin H6, which is found in skin secretions of frogs of the Bombinae family, attacks gram-negative bacteria and acts haemolytically. While the peptide spontaneously folds into similar structures in both neutral dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) and negatively charged sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) micelles, its structure is more flexible in SDS as shown by 15N relaxation measurements. In addition, it is bound closer to the surface of the micelle and rotated by ∼70° around its helix axis in the negatively charged membrane surrogate compared to the structure in DPC. This might form the basis for peptide–peptide interactions through a GxxxG motif, which could finally lead to membrane disruption and, thus, preferential attack of negatively charged microbial cell walls.

Do superspreaders generate new superspreaders? a hypothesis to explain the propagation pattern of COVID-19

Abstract The current global propagation of COVID-19 is heterogeneous, with slow transmission continuing in many countries, and exponential propagation in others, in which the time that took to begin this explosive spread varies greatly. It is proposed that this could be explained by cascading superspreading events, in which new infections caused by a superspreader are more likely to be highly infectious. The mechanism suggested for this is related to viral loads. Exposure to high viral loads may result in infections of high intensity, which exposes new cases to high viral loads, and so on. This notion is supported by experimental veterinary research.

Detection of respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus in healthy infants

BACKGROUND: Despite the research importance of rhinovirus detection in asymptomatic healthy infants, the literature remains sparse. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (and its species). METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 110 healthy, non-hospitalized infants without acute illness at an academic medical center from November 2013 through May 2014. We tested nasal swab specimens by using polymerase chain reaction and genetic sequencing. RESULTS: Overall, the median age was 3.8 months (IQR 2.0–5.1 months), 56 % were male, and 90 % were born >37 weeks. RSV was detected in nasal swabs from infants (1.8 %). By contrast, rhinovirus was detected in nasal swabs from 16 infants (14.5 %). Molecular typing assay revealed rhinovirus species: six rhinovirus-A (5.5 %), one rhinovirus-B (0.9 %), eight rhinovirus-C (7.3 %), and one untypeable (0.9 %). CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study of healthy, community-based infants, RSV was rare (<2 %) in nasal swabs, while rhinovirus was detected in 14.5 % with a predominance of rhinovirus-A and -C. These finding are important for understanding the clinical significance of rhinovirus detection among infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis.

Increased Systemic Cytokine/Chemokine Expression in Asthmatic and Non‐asthmatic Patients with Bacterial, Viral or Mixed Lung Infection

This study was aimed to determine the profiles of serum cytokines (IL‐1β, TNF‐α, IL‐4, IL‐5) and chemokines (MCP‐1: monocyte chemoattract protein‐1 and RANTES: regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) in individuals with an asthmatic versus a non‐asthmatic background with bacterial, viral or mixed acute respiratory infection. Asthmatic (n = 14) and non‐asthmatic (n = 29) patients with acute viral, bacterial or mixed (bacterial and viruses) respiratory infection were studied. Patients were also analysed as individuals with pneumonia or bronchitis. Healthy individuals with similar age and sex (n = 10) were used as controls. Cytokine/chemokine content in serum was determined by ELISA. Increased cytokine/chemokine concentration in asthmatic and non‐asthmatic patients was observed. However, higher concentrations of chemokines (MCP‐1 and RANTES) in asthmatic patients infected by viruses, bacteria or bacteria and viruses (mixed) than in non‐asthmatic patients were observed. In general, viral and mixed infections were better cytokine/chemokine inducers than bacterial infection. Cytokine/chemokine expression was similarly increased in both asthmatic and non‐asthmatic patients with pneumonia or bronchitis, except that RANTES remained at normal levels in bronchitis. Circulating cytokine profiles induced by acute viral, bacterial or mixed lung infection were not related to asthmatic background, except for chemokines that were increased in asthmatic status.

Molecular Detection of Adenoviruses, Rhabdoviruses, and Paramyxoviruses in Bats from Kenya

We screened 217 bats of at least 20 species from 17 locations in Kenya during July and August of 2006 for the presence of adenovirus, rhabdovirus, and paramyxovirus nucleic acids using generic reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and PCR assays. Of 217 bat fecal swabs examined, 4 bats were adenovirus DNA-positive, 11 bats were paramyxovirus RNA-positive, and 2 bats were rhabdovirus RNA-positive. Three bats were coinfected by two different viruses. By sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis, the Kenya bat paramyxoviruses and rhabdoviruses from this study may represent novel viral lineages within their respective families; the Kenya bat adenoviruses could not be confirmed as novel, because the same region sequences from other known bat adenovirus genomes for comparison were lacking. Our study adds to previous evidence that bats carry diverse, potentially zoonotic viruses and may be coinfected with more than one virus.

Saikosaponin b2 enhances the hepatotargeting effect of anticancer drugs through inhibition of multidrug resistance-associated drug transporters

Abstract Aims: Vinegar-baked Radix Bupleuri (VBRB) potentiates the activity of anticancer drugs in the liver by increasing their hepatic distribution. However, this phenomenon may be associated with drug transporters. We investigated the effect of saikosaponin b2 (SSb2; the main component of VBRB) on the activity and expression of different drug transporters in both normal cells and those that overexpress the transporter. Main methods: The activities of transporters were analyzed by concentration of their cellular substrates. Concentrations of colchicine (substrate of Pgp and MRP1) and cisplatin (substrate of OCT2 and MRP2) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The concentration of rhodamine B was determined by flow cytometry. The expression of transporter gene and protein were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. Key findings: SSb2 increased colchicine efflux in HEK293 cells by primarily increasing Mrp1 activity, independent of gene and protein expression. SSb2 enhanced Mrp2 function and increased cisplatin efflux in BRL3A cells by upregulating Mrp2 gene expression, with a marginal effect on Pgp in normal cells. SSb2 increased OCT2 activity in OCT2-HEK293 cells by increasing the expression of OCT2 protein and mRNA; however, SSb2 inhibited MRP2 activity in MRP2-HEK293 cells by decreasing MRP2 protein expression, and decreased Pgp and MRP1 activity in Pgp- and MRP1-HEK293 cells. Significance: SSb2 might potentially be the key active component of VBRB that enhances the hepatotargeting of anticancer drugs through the inhibition of multidrug resistance-associated drug transporters (Pgp, MRP1, and MRP2) in an environment-dependent manner.

Haematological and Immunological Data of Chinese Children Infected with Coronavirus Disease 2019

Haematological and immunological data of children with COVID-19 infection is lacking. Between 21(st) January and 20(th) March 2020, 244 children who were confirmed to have COVID-19 infection and admitted to the Wuhan Children's Hospital, China were retrospectively reviewed. 193 children were considered as symptomatic, which was defined as having either the presence of clinical symptoms or the presence of CT thorax abnormalities. Their haematological and immunological profiles, including complete blood counts, lymphocyte subsets (T, B and NK cell counts), immunoglobulin (Ig) profiles (IgG, IgA and IgM) and cytokine profiles were analysed and compared between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. The median values and the interquartile ranges were calculated. Comparison was made using the Mann–Whitney U test. Children with symptomatic COVID-19 infection had significantly lower haemoglobin levels, but higher absolute lymphocyte and monocyte counts, IgG and IgA levels, as well as interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, tumour necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma levels. The obtained data will be utilized for further studies in comparing children and adults with COVID-19 infections in other parts of the world and with different severity.

An investigation of dairy calf management practices, colostrum quality, failure of transfer of passive immunity, and occurrence of enteropathogens among Australian dairy farms

ABSTRACT Calf preweaning morbidity and mortality risks have been reported as high in several countries, with average values approximating 35 and 7%, respectively. However, limited data are available for calf morbidity and mortality risks on Australian dairy farms. The aims of this study were (1) to investigate current calf management practices on dairy farms in Australia and their association with herd-level morbidity and mortality using a questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study; and (2) to estimate the prevalence of common enteropathogens causing diarrhea, the failure of passive transfer of immunity, and poor colostrum quality in a sample of Australian dairy farms. We analyzed 106 completed questionnaires and samples from 23 farms (202 fecal, 253 calf serum, and 221 colostrum samples). Morbidity and mortality risks reported by farmers in preweaned heifers were 23.8 and 5.6%, respectively. These risks were above the Australian dairy industry targets in 75.5 and 66.7% of respondents. The zoonotic pathogens Cryptosporidium spp. and Salmonella spp. were the most prevalent enteropathogens, with a true prevalence of 40.9 and 25.2%, respectively. Salmonella O-group D was present in 67.9% of Salmonella-positive samples, followed by O-groups B (17.9%) and C (10.7%). Failure of transfer of passive immunity (IgG <10 g/L) was observed in 41.9% of calves (mean herd-level prevalence of 36.2%), and only 19.5% of colostrum samples met the standards for immunoglobulin content and microbiological quality. Collectively, these data indicate that there is still considerable room for improvement in calf-rearing practices on Australian dairy farms, particularly with regard to colostrum management and feeding hygiene.

Bumped kinase inhibitor 1369 is effective against Cystoisospora suis in vivo and in vitro

Cystoisosporosis is a leading diarrheal disease in suckling piglets. With the confirmation of resistance against the only available drug toltrazuril, there is a substantial need for novel therapeutics to combat the infection and its negative effects on animal health. In closely related apicomplexan species, bumped kinase inhibitors (BKIs) targeting calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) were shown to be effective in inhibiting host-cell invasion and parasite growth. Therefore, the gene coding for Cystoisospora suis CDPK1 (CsCDPK1) was identified and cloned to investigate activity and thermal stabilization of the recombinant CsCDPK1 enzyme by BKI 1369. In this comprehensive study, the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of BKI 1369 in piglets experimentally infected with Cystoisospora suis (toltrazuril-sensitive, Wien-I and toltrazuril-resistant, Holland-I strains) were determined in vivo and in vitro using an established animal infection model and cell culture, respectively. BKI 1369 inhibited merozoite proliferation in intestinal porcine epithelial cells-1 (IPEC-1) by at least 50% at a concentration of 40 nM, and proliferation was almost completely inhibited (>95%) at 200 nM. Nonetheless, exposure of infected cultures to 200 nM BKI 1369 for five days did not induce structural alterations in surviving merozoites as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Five-day treatment with BKI 1369 (10 mg/kg BW twice a day) effectively suppressed oocyst excretion and diarrhea and improved body weight gains in treated piglets without obvious side effects for both toltrazuril-sensitive, Wien-I and resistant, Holland-I C. suis strains. The plasma concentration of BKI 1369 in piglets increased to 11.7 μM during treatment, suggesting constant drug accumulation and exposure of parasites to the drug. Therefore, oral applications of BKI 1369 could potentially be a therapeutic alternative against porcine cystoisosporosis. For use in pigs, future studies on BKI 1369 should be directed towards ease of drug handling and minimizing treatment frequencies.

Technology innovations for food security in Singapore: A case study of future food systems for an increasingly natural resource-scarce world

BACKGROUND: Food security is becoming an increasingly important global issue. Anthropogenic factors such as rapid urbanization and industrialization have strained finite resources like land and water. Therefore, against the impending threat of food security, the world can no longer rely on traditional methods to meet its needs. Instead, more creative and technologically advanced methods must be adopted to maximise diminishing natural resources. Singapore is a good case study of a small city-state that is trying to increase its own self-production of food using technology. SCOPE AND APPROACH: This review highlights the technologies that Singapore have adopted in enhancing food security given its limitation in natural resources. These methodologies serve as a case study that can be used as a reference point in light of the increasingly finite natural resources. The review also presents the advantages of these techniques as well as challenges that need to be overcome for them to be more widely adopted. KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION: To increase self-production of food and enhance its food security, Singapore has employed the use of technologies such as vertical farming and aquaponics in urban farming, nutrient recovery from food waste, biodegradable food packaging from durian rinds, natural preservatives, insect farming, microalgae and cultivated meat as alternative protein sources. These technologies workaround Singapore's land and natural resource constraints, which many countries around the world can adapt. However, many of them are still relatively nascent with numerous challenges, which have to be addressed before they can be widely accepted and implemented.

Aerosols and splatter in dentistry A brief review of the literature and infection control implications

ABSTRACT Background Aerosols and droplets are produced during many dental procedures. With the advent of the droplet-spread disease severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, a review of the infection control procedures for aerosols is warranted. Types of Studies Reviewed The authors reviewed representative medical and dental literature for studies and reports that documented the spread of disease through an airborne route. They also reviewed the dental literature for representative studies of contamination from various dental procedures and methods of reducing airborne contamination from those procedures. Results The airborne spread of measles, tuberculosis and SARS is well-documented in the medical literature. The dental literature shows that many dental procedures produce aerosols and droplets that are contaminated with bacteria and blood. These aerosols represent a potential route for disease transmission. The literature also documents that airborne contamination can be minimized easily and inexpensively by layering several infection control steps into the routine precautions used during all dental procedures. Clinical Implications In addition to the routine use of standard barriers such as masks and gloves, the universal use of pre-procedural rinses and high-volume evacuation is recommended.

The impact of multiple infections on wild animal hosts: a review

Field parasitological studies consistently demonstrate the reality of polyparasitism in natural systems. However, only recently, studies from ecological and evolutionary fields have emphasised a broad spectrum of potential multiple infections-related impacts. The main goal of our review is to reunify the different approaches on the impacts of polyparasitism, not only from laboratory or human medical studies but also from field or theoretical studies. We put forward that ecological and epidemiological determinants to explain the level of polyparasitism, which regularly affects not only host body condition, survival or reproduction but also host metabolism, genetics or immune investment. Despite inherent limitations of all these studies, multiple infections should be considered more systematically in wildlife to better appreciate the importance of parasite diversity in wildlife, cumulative effects of parasitism on the ecology and evolution of their hosts.

Preliminary support for a “dry swab, extraction free” protocol for SARS-CoV-2 testing via RT-qPCR

The urgent need for massively scaled clinical or surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 has necessitated a reconsideration of the methods by which respiratory samples are collected, transported, processed and tested. Conventional testing for SARS-CoV-2 involves collection of a clinical specimen with a nasopharyngeal swab, storage of the swab during transport in universal transport medium (UTM), extraction of RNA, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). As testing has scaled across the world, supply chain challenges have emerged across this entire workflow. Here we sought to evaluate how eliminating the UTM storage and RNA extraction steps would impact the results of molecular testing. Using paired mid-turbinate swabs self-collected by 11 individuals with previously established SARS-CoV-2 positivity, we performed a comparison of conventional (swab → UTM → RNA extraction → RT-qPCR) vs. simplified (direct elution from dry swab → RT-qPCR) protocols. Our results suggest that dry swabs eluted directly into a simple buffered solution (TE) can support molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 via endpoint RT-qPCR without substantially compromising sensitivity. Although further confirmation with a larger sample size and variation of other parameters is necessary, these results are encouraging for the possibility of a simplified workflow that could support massively scaled testing for COVID-19 control.

Molecular and pathogenicity of infectious bronchitis virus (Gammacoronavirus) in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica)

Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection is highly infectious respiratory disease in poultry industry with significant economic importance. The prevalence of IBV in quail industry in Malaysia was not well documented; therefore, its actual role in the epidemiology of the disease is relatively unknown. This study was to determine the susceptibility of Japanese quail, as one of the species in commercial poultry industry, toward IBV. In addition, it will also give a potential impact on the overall health management in the quail industry even though it had been established that quail are resistant to diseases affecting poultry. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first experimental study on IBV inoculation in quail. In this experimental study, 20 quails were divided into 4 groups (n = 5 for group A, B, and C, n = 5 for control group). The quails in group A, B, and C were infected via intraocular and intranasal routes with 0.2 mL of 10 × 5 EID50 of the virus. Clinical signs, gross lesions, positive detection of virus, and trachea histopathological scoring were used to assess the susceptibility of these Japanese quails. The results have indicated mild ruffled feathers and watery feces in these inoculated birds. Trachea, lung, and kidney were subjected to one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for virus detection. The virus was found from trachea and lung samples, whereas it was absent from all kidney samples. Only 3 quails were found with gross lesions. There was a significant difference of tracheal lesion by 0.009 ± 0.845 (P < 0.05) within the treatment groups. In summary, Japanese quails might be susceptible to IBV.

Histone Deacetylases in Herpesvirus Replication and Virus-Stimulated Host Defense

Emerging evidence highlights a critical role for protein acetylation during herpesvirus infection. As prominent modulators of protein acetylation, histone deacetylases (HDACs) are essential transcriptional and epigenetic regulators. Not surprisingly, viruses have evolved a wide array of mechanisms to subvert HDAC functions. Here, we review the mechanisms underlying HDAC regulation during herpesvirus infection. We next discuss the roles of acetylation in host defense against herpesvirus infection. Finally, we provide a perspective on the contribution of current mass spectrometry-based “omic” technologies to infectious disease research, offering a systems biology view of infection.

Perception of spokespersons' performance and characteristics in crisis communication: Experience of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Taiwan

Background/Purpose To explore perception of spokespersons' performance and characteristics in response to the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Methods This study was conducted from March to July, 2005, using semi-structured in-depth interviews to collect data. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A qualitative content analysis was employed to analyze the transcribed data. Interviewees included media reporters, media supervisors, health and medical institution executives or spokespersons, and social observers. Results Altogether, 35 interviewees were recruited for in-depth interviews, and the duration of the interview ranged from 1 hour to 2 hours. Results revealed that the most important characteristics of health/medical institutions spokespersons are professional competence and good interaction with the media. In contrast, the most important behaviors they should avoid are concealing the truth and misreporting the truth. Three major flaws of spokespersons' performance were identified: they included poor understanding of media needs and landscape; blaming the media to cover up a mistake they made in an announcement; and lack of sufficient participation in decision-making or of authorization from the head of organization. Conclusion Spokespersons of health and medical institutions play an important role in media relations during the crisis of a newly emerging infectious disease.

Serological survey on canine coronavirus antibodies in giant pandas by virus neutralization test

In order to survey the infectious situation of canine coronavirus (CCV) in giant panda population, a virus neutralization test detecting specific antibodies against CCV in giant panda’s sera was established by using two-fold dilutions of serum and 100 TCID(50) of the virus. The 62 sera samples of giant pandas, which were gathered from zoos and reserve region of Sichuan Province, China were detected. The neutralization antibody titer of 1:4 was recognized as the positive criterion, 8 sera samples were detected to be positive, and the positive rate was 12.9%. The titers of neutralizing antibody ranged from 1:8 to 1:32. It was the first comprehensive investigation on neutralization antibodies against CCV in giant panda population in China. The results of study showed that the infection of CCV in giant panda population was universal, which has posed a threat to the health of giant panda. Therefore, it is incumbent on us to study safe and effective vaccines to protect giant panda against CCV infection.

Large-Scale Preparation of UV-Inactivated SARS Coronavirus Virions for Vaccine Antigen

In general, a whole virion serves as a simple vaccine antigen and often essential material for the analysis of immune responses against virus infection. However, to work with highly contagious pathogens, it is necessary to take precautions against laboratory-acquired infection. We have learned many lessons from the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In order to develop an effective vaccine and diagnostic tools, we prepared UV-inactivated SARS coronavirus on a large scale under the strict Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) regulation. Our protocol for large-scale preparation of UV-inactivated SARS-CoV including virus expansion, titration, inactivation, and ultracentrifugation is applicable to any newly emerging virus we might encounter in the future.

Molecular and functional insights into a novel teleost malectin from big-belly seahorse Hippocampus abdominalis

Abstract Malectin is a carbohydrate-binding lectin protein found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It selectivity binds to Glc2-N-glycan and is involved in a glycoprotein quality control mechanism. Even though malectin may play a role in immunity, its role in innate immunity is not fully known. In the present study, we identified and characterized the malectin gene from Hippocampus abdominalis (HaMLEC). We analyzed sequence features, spatial expression levels, temporal expression profiles upon immune responses, bacterial and carbohydrate binding abilities and anti-viral properties to investigate the potential role of HaMLEC in innate immunity. The molecular weight and isoelectric point (pI) were estimated to be 31.99 kDa and 5.17, respectively. The N-terminal signal peptide, malectin superfamily domain and C-terminal transmembrane region were identified from the amino acid sequence of HaMLEC. The close evolutionary relationship of HaMLEC with other teleosts was identified by phylogenetic analysis. According to quantitative PCR (qPCR) results, HaMLEC expression was observed in all the examined tissues and high expression was observed in the ovary and brain, compared to other tested tissues. Temporal expression of HaMLEC in liver and blood tissues were significant modulated upon exposure to immunogens Edwardasiella tarda, Streptococcus iniae, polyinosinic:polycytidylic and lipopolysaccharide. The presence of carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) of bacterial glycosyl hydrolases were functionally confirmed by a bacterial binding assay. Anti-viral activity significantly reduced viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) replication in cells overexpressing HaMLEC. The observed results suggested that HaMLEC may have a significant role in innate immunity in Hippocampus abdominalis.

Bayesian mixture analysis for metagenomic community profiling

Motivation: Deep sequencing of clinical samples is now an established tool for the detection of infectious pathogens, with direct medical applications. The large amount of data generated produces an opportunity to detect species even at very low levels, provided that computational tools can effectively profile the relevant metagenomic communities. Data interpretation is complicated by the fact that short sequencing reads can match multiple organisms and by the lack of completeness of existing databases, in particular for viral pathogens. Here we present metaMix, a Bayesian mixture model framework for resolving complex metagenomic mixtures. We show that the use of parallel Monte Carlo Markov chains for the exploration of the species space enables the identification of the set of species most likely to contribute to the mixture. Results: We demonstrate the greater accuracy of metaMix compared with relevant methods, particularly for profiling complex communities consisting of several related species. We designed metaMix specifically for the analysis of deep transcriptome sequencing datasets, with a focus on viral pathogen detection; however, the principles are generally applicable to all types of metagenomic mixtures. Availability and implementation: metaMix is implemented as a user friendly R package, freely available on CRAN: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metaMix Contact: sofia.morfopoulou.10@ucl.ac.uk Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bionformatics online.

Detection of viral acute lower respiratory tract infection in hospitalized infants using real-time PCR

Abstract Introduction Acute lower respiratory tract infection in children causes significant morbidity in the developing countries. Documentation of virus infection using PCR and clinical characteristics of patients affected with viral pneumonia are reviewed in this study. Methods 51 children less than three years admitted to the Pediatric Hospital, Cairo University with viral pneumonia were included. All patients had undergone nasopharyngeal aspirate for PCR viral detection. Results A total of 51 cases were enrolled in the study, of which 7 cases were negative while 44 children were positive for viruses. The most common respiratory virus was Rhinovirus in 32 patients (72.2%), then parainfluenza virus (PIV) in 12 (27.3%), of which subtypes PIV1 were 2 (4.5%), PIV3 were 5 (11.4%) and PIV4 were 5 (11.4%) cases. The third common viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 9 (20.5%) cases of which 3 (6.8%) were RSVA and 6 (13.6%) were RSVB and adenovirus in 9 cases (20.5%). Boca virus was found in 8 (18.2%) patients, corona virus 2 (4.5%) patients, H1N1 2 (4.5%) patients, enterovirus 2 patients (4.5%) and human metapneumovirus in one case (2.3%). Influenza B and PIV2 were not detected. Coinfection was found in 28 (63.7%). Mortality occurred in 12 (23.5%). There was no significant relation between virus type or coinfection with disease severity. Conclusions RV was the most commonly detected virus in children under 3years admitted with acute lower respiratory tract infections. Coinfection was present in the majority of our patients; however it was not related significantly to parameters of disease severity.

Fever in travellers returning from the tropics

Abstract The increase in international travel, the growing presence of arbovirus vectors in our country, and notifications of haemorrhagic fever such as the current outbreak of Ebola in D.R. Congo and the cases of Crimea-Congo haemorrhagic fever in our country have again cast the spotlight on tropical diseases. Isolating suspected cases of highly contagious and lethal diseases must be a priority (haemorrhagic fever, MERS-CoV). Assessing the patient, taking a careful medical history based on epidemiological aspects of the area of origin, activities they have carried out, their length of stay in the area and the onset of symptoms, will eventually help us, if not to make a definitive diagnosis, at least to exclude diseases that pose a threat to these patients. Malaria should be ruled out because of its frequency, without forgetting other common causes of fever familiar to emergency doctors.

Assessment of N95 respirator decontamination and re-use for SARS-CoV-2

The unprecedented pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has created worldwide shortages of personal protective equipment, in particular respiratory protection such as N95 respirators. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is frequently occurring in hospital settings, with numerous reported cases of nosocomial transmission highlighting the vulnerability of healthcare workers. In general, N95 respirators are designed for single use prior to disposal. Here, we have analyzed four readily available and often used decontamination methods: UV, 70% ethanol, 70C heat and vaporized hydrogen peroxide for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 on N95 respirators. Equally important we assessed the function of the N95 respirators after multiple wear and decontamination sessions.

Effects of Triton X-100 on Properties of Hemoglobin and Controlled Release of Drug in Hemoglobin/Ribavirin/H2O System

Abstract Effects of Triton X-100 on the properties of hemoglobin (Hb) and on the controlled release of ribavirin were studied using the methods of UV-Vis spectrum, fluorescence spectrum, zeta potential, conductivity, high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC), and image morphology in Hb/ribavirin/H2O system. With the increase of concentration of Triton X-100 in the system, the intrinsic fluorescence intensity, synchronous fluorescence intensity, fluorescence polarization, zeta potential, and morphology of Hb all changed gradually, and the ribavirin located on the Hb surface was dissociated and released out. When the concentration of Triton X-100 was higher than 1×10−5 mol·L−1, the stronger interaction of Triton X-100 with Hb was predominant. Hb was unfolded and denaturized. A little Triton X-100 can protect Hb from the effects of ribavirin.

Contrasting clinical outcomes in two cohorts of cats naturally infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)

Despite over 25 years of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) research, relatively little is known about the longitudinal course of FIV infection following natural infection. In contrast to published reports of experimental infections using lethal strains of the virus, clinical signs of naturally acquired FIV infection can be mild or inapparent, rather than life-threatening. In this prospective, longitudinal controlled study, based in Chicago, IL (n = 17) and Memphis, TN (n = 27), we investigated two cohorts of privately owned, naturally infected cats kept under different housing conditions. Cats in the Chicago cohort (Group 1) were kept in households of ≤2 cats, while the Memphis cohort (Group 2) comprised part of a large multi-cat household of over 60 cats kept indoors only, with unrestricted access to one another. The majority of cats from Group 1 did not display clinical signs consistent with immunodeficiency during the 22-month observation period. In contrast, the outcome of infection in Group 2 was dramatically different; 17/27 (63%) of cats lost a median of 51.3% of their bodyweight (P < 0.0005) and died during the study period, with lymphoma being the most common cause of mortality. Although the decrease in CD4+ T cell count between enrolment and terminal disease was significant (P = 0.0017), the CD4:CD8 ratio at the time of enrolment did not reliably distinguish FIV-positive cats classified as ‘healthy’ and ‘not healthy’ at either cohort. FIV load at enrolment was significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2 (P < 0.0001), but there were no significant differences at enrolment between healthy and not healthy cats at either group. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that management and housing conditions impact on disease progression and survival times of FIV-positive cats.

Black–White Risk Differentials in COVID-19 (SARS-COV2) Transmission, Mortality and Case Fatality in the United States: Translational Epidemiologic Perspective and Challenges

Background: Social and health inequities predispose vulnerable populations to adverse morbidity and mortality outcomes of epidemics and pandemics. While racial disparities in cumulative incidence (CmI) and mortality from the influenza pandemics of 1918 and 2009 implicated Blacks with survival disadvantage relative to Whites in the United States, COVID-19 currently indicates comparable disparities. We aimed to: (a) assess COVID-19 CmI by race, (b) determine the Black–White case fatality (CF) and risk differentials, and (c) apply explanatory model for mortality risk differentials. Methods: COVID-19 data on confirmed cases and deaths by selective states health departments were assessed using a cross-sectional ecologic design. Chi-square was used for CF independence, while binomial regression model for the Black–White risk differentials. Results: The COVID-19 mortality CmI indicated Blacks/AA with 34% of the total mortality in the United States, albeit their 13% population size. The COVID-19 CF was higher among Blacks/AA relative to Whites; Maryland, (2.7% vs. 2.5%), Wisconsin (7.4% vs. 4.8%), Illinois (4.8% vs. 4.2%), Chicago (5.9% vs. 3.2%), Detroit (Michigan), 7.2% and St. John the Baptist Parish (Louisiana), 7.9%. Blacks/AA compared to Whites in Michigan were 15% more likely to die, CmI risk ratio (CmIRR) = 1.15, 95% CI, 1.01–1.32. Blacks/AA relative to Whites in Illinois were 13% more likely to die, CmIRR = 1.13, 95% CI, 0.93–1.39, while Blacks/AA compared to Whites in Wisconsin were 51% more likely to die, CmIRR = 1.51, 95% CI, 1.10–2.10. In Chicago, Blacks/AA were more than twice as likely to die, CmIRR = 2.24, 95% CI, 1.36–3.88. Conclusion: Substantial racial/ethnic disparities are observed in COVID-19 CF and mortality with Blacks/AA disproportionately affected across the United States.

More on COVID‐19 coagulopathy in Caucasian patients

We are grateful for the comments of Marrietta et al, [1] and welcome the opportunity to provide further details on the coagulopathy observed in our patients with COVID-19 infection [2]. The weight-adjusted low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) thromboprophylaxis used in the study is that routinely used for hospital in-patients in our institution, consistent with national recommendations [3,4] With respect to the cohort of patients with COVID-19 enrolled in our study, it is important to highlight that 74% of patients received enoxaparin 40mg (4000 IU) subcutaneously once daily.

Evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 outside Hubei province, China: a descriptive and modelling study

BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in Wuhan city, Hubei province, in December, 2019, and has spread throughout China. Understanding the evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. METHODS: We collected individual information from official public sources on laboratory-confirmed cases reported outside Hubei in mainland China for the period of Jan 19 to Feb 17, 2020. We used the date of the fourth revision of the case definition (Jan 27) to divide the epidemic into two time periods (Dec 24 to Jan 27, and Jan 28 to Feb 17) as the date of symptom onset. We estimated trends in the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (R(t)) at the provincial level. FINDINGS: We collected data on 8579 cases from 30 provinces. The median age of cases was 44 years (33–56), with an increasing proportion of cases in younger age groups and in elderly people (ie, aged >64 years) as the epidemic progressed. The mean time from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4·4 days (95% CI 0·0–14·0) for the period of Dec 24 to Jan 27, to 2·6 days (0·0–9·0) for the period of Jan 28 to Feb 17. The mean incubation period for the entire period was estimated at 5·2 days (1·8–12·4) and the mean serial interval at 5·1 days (1·3–11·6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei were highly variable but consistently included a mixture of case importations and local transmission. We estimated that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than 3 weeks, with mean Rt reaching peaks between 1·08 (95% CI 0·74–1·54) in Shenzhen city of Guangdong province and 1·71 (1·32–2·17) in Shandong province. In all the locations for which we had sufficient data coverage of Rt, Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold (ie, <1) after Jan 30. INTERPRETATION: Our estimates of the incubation period and serial interval were similar, suggesting an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission before the onset of symptoms. Our results also indicate that, as the epidemic progressed, infectious individuals were isolated more quickly, thus shortening the window of transmission in the community. Overall, our findings indicate that strict containment measures, movement restrictions, and increased awareness of the population might have contributed to interrupt local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 outside Hubei province.

Proteome analysis of vaccinia virus IHD-W-infected HEK 293 cells with 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-PSD-TOF MS of on solid phase support N-terminally sulfonated peptides

BACKGROUND: Despite the successful eradication of smallpox by the WHO-led vaccination programme, pox virus infections remain a considerable health threat. The possible use of smallpox as a bioterrorism agent as well as the continuous occurrence of zoonotic pox virus infections document the relevance to deepen the understanding for virus host interactions. Since the permissiveness of pox infections is independent of hosts surface receptors, but correlates with the ability of the virus to infiltrate the antiviral host response, it directly depends on the hosts proteome set. In this report the proteome of HEK293 cells infected with Vaccinia Virus strain IHD-W was analyzed by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-PSD-TOF MS in a bottom-up approach. RESULTS: The cellular and viral proteomes of VACV IHD-W infected HEK293 cells, UV-inactivated VACV IHD-W-treated as well as non-infected cells were compared. Derivatization of peptides with 4-sulfophenyl isothiocyanate (SPITC) carried out on ZipTipμ-C18 columns enabled protein identification via the peptides' primary sequence, providing improved s/n ratios as well as signal intensities of the PSD spectra. The expression of more than 24 human proteins was modulated by the viral infection. Effects of UV-inactivated and infectious viruses on the hosts' proteome concerning energy metabolism and proteins associated with gene expression and protein-biosynthesis were quite similar. These effects might therefore be attributed to virus entry and virion proteins. However, the modulation of proteins involved in apoptosis was clearly correlated to infectious viruses. CONCLUSIONS: The proteome analysis of infected cells provides insight into apoptosis modulation, regulation of cellular gene expression and the regulation of energy metabolism. The confidence of protein identifications was clearly improved by the peptides' derivatization with SPITC on a solid phase support. Some of the identified proteins have not been described in the context of poxvirus infections before and need to be further characterised to identify their meaning for apoptosis modulation and pathogenesis.

Beclin orthologs: integrative hubs of cell signaling, membrane trafficking, and physiology

The Beclin family, including yeast Atg6 (autophagy related gene 6), its orthologs in higher eukaryotic species, and the more recently characterized mammalian-specific Beclin 2, are essential molecules in autophagy and other membrane-trafficking events. Extensive studies of Beclin orthologs have provided considerable insights into the regulation of autophagy, the diverse roles of autophagy in physiology and disease, and potential new strategies to modulate autophagy in a variety of clinical diseases. In this review we discuss the functions of Beclin 1 orthologs, the regulation of such functions by diverse cellular signaling pathways, and the effects of such regulation on downstream cellular processes including tumor suppression and metabolism. These findings suggest that Beclin orthologs serve as crucial molecules that integrate diverse environmental signals with membrane trafficking events to ensure optimal responses of the cell to stressful stimuli.

Chapter Twelve China–Africa Cooperation Initiatives in Malaria Control and Elimination

Abstract Malaria has affected human health globally with a significant burden of disease, and also has impeded social and economic development in the areas where it is present. In Africa, many countries have faced serious challenges in controlling malaria, in part due to major limitations in public health systems and primary health care infrastructure. Although China is a developing country, a set of control strategies and measures in different local settings have been implemented successfully by the National Malaria Control Programme over the last 60 years, with a low cost of investment. It is expected that Chinese experience may benefit malaria control in Africa. This review will address the importance and possibility of China–Africa collaboration in control of malaria in targeted African countries, as well as how to proceed toward the goal of elimination where this is technically feasible.

Roles of peroxiredoxins in cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and inflammatory diseases

Abstract Peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) are antioxidant enzymes, known to catalyze peroxide reduction to balance cellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels, which are essential for cell signaling and metabolism and act as a regulator of redox signaling. Redox signaling is a critical component of cell signaling pathways that are involved in the regulation of cell growth, metabolism, hormone signaling, immune regulation and variety of other physiological functions. Early studies demonstrated that PRDXs regulates cell growth, metabolism and immune regulation and therefore involved in the pathologic regulator or protectant of several cancers, neurodegenerative diseases and inflammatory diseases. Oxidative stress and antioxidant systems are important regulators of redox signaling regulated diseases. In addition, thiol-based redox systems through peroxiredoxins have been demonstrated to regulate several redox-dependent process related diseases. In this review article, we will discuss recent findings regarding PRDXs in the development of diseases and further discuss therapeutic approaches targeting PRDXs. Moreover, we will suggest that PRDXs could be targets of several diseases and the therapeutic agents for targeting PRDXs may have potential beneficial effects for the treatment of cancers, neurodegenerative diseases and inflammatory diseases. Future research should open new avenues for the design of novel therapeutic approaches targeting PRDXs.

Delayed Treatment of Diagnosed Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Taiwan

BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is an ongoing public health problem in Taiwan. The National Tuberculosis Registry Campaign, a case management system, was implemented in 1997. This study examined this monitoring system to identify and characterize delayed treatment of TB patients. METHODS: Records of all tuberculosis cases treated in Taiwan from 2002 through 2005 were obtained from the National Tuberculosis Registry Campaign. Initiation of treatment more than 7 days after diagnosis was considered a long treatment delay. RESULTS: The study included 31,937 patients. The mean day of delayed treatment was 3.6 days. Most patients were treated immediately after diagnosis. The relationship between number of TB patients and days of delayed treatment after diagnosis exhibited a Power-law distribution. The long tail of the power-law distribution indicated that an extreme number occur cannot be neglected. Tuberculosis patients treated after an unusually long delay require close observation and follow up. CONCLUSION: This study found that TB control is generally acceptabl in Taiwan; however, delayed treatment increases the risk of transmission. Improving the protocol for managing confirmed TB cases can minimize disease transmission.

Prediction of the number of deaths in India due to SARS-CoV-2 at 5–6 weeks

Abstract Introduction and Aims: No valid treatment or preventative strategy has evolved till date to counter the SARS CoV 2 (Novel Coronavirus) epidemic that originated in China in late 2019 and have since wrought havoc on millions across the world with illness, socioeconomic recession and death. This analysis was aimed at tracing a trend related to death counts expected at the 5th and 6th week of the COVID-19 in India. Material and methods Validated database was used to procure global and Indian data related to coronavirus and related outcomes. Multiple regression and linear regression analyses were used interchangeably. Since the week 6 death count data was not correlated significantly with any of the chosen inputs, an auto-regression technique was employed to improve the predictive ability of the regression model. Results A linear regression analysis predicted average week 5 death count to be 211 with a 95% CI: 1.31–2.60). Similarly, week 6 death count, in spite of a strong correlation with input variables, did not pass the test of statistical significance. Using auto-regression technique and using week 5 death count as input the linear regression model predicted week 6 death count in India to be 467, while keeping at the back of our mind the risk of over-estimation by most of the risk-based models. Conclusion According to our analysis, if situation continue in present state; projected death rate (n) is 211 and467 at the end of the 5th and 6th week from now, respectively.

Viral and Bacterial Etiology of Acute Febrile Respiratory Syndrome among Patients in Qinghai, China

Abstract Objective This study was conducted to investigate the viral and bacterial etiology and epidemiology of patients with acute febrile respiratory syndrome (AFRS) in Qinghai using a commercial routine multiplex-ligation-nucleic acid amplification test (NAT)-based assay. Methods A total of 445 nasopharyngeal swabs specimens from patients with AFRS were analyzed using the RespiFinderSmart22kit (PathoFinder BV, Netherlands) and the LightCycler 480 real-time PCR system. Results Among the 225 (225/445, 51%) positive specimens, 329 positive pathogens were detected, including 298 (90.58%) viruses and 31 (9%) bacteria. The most commonly detected pathogens were influenza virus (IFV; 37.39%; 123/329), adenovirus (AdV; 17.02%; 56/329), human coronaviruses (HCoVs; 10.94%; 36/329), rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV; 10.03%; 33/329), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs; 8.51%; 28/329), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneu; 8.51%; 28/329), respectively. Among the co-infected cases (17.53%; 78/445), IFV/AdV and IFV/M. pneu were the most common co-infections. Most of the respiratory viruses were detected in summer and fall. Conclusion In our study, IFV-A was the most common respiratory pathogen among 22 detected pathogens, followed by AdV, HCoV, RV/EV, PIV, and M. pneu. Bacteria appeared less frequently than viruses, and co-infection was the most common phenomenon among viral pathogens. Pathogens were distributed among different age groups and respiratory viruses were generally active in July, September, and November. Enhanced surveillance and early detection can be useful in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of AFRS, as well as for guiding the development of appropriate public health strategies.

Synthesis and activity of an octapeptide inhibitor designed for SARS coronavirus main proteinase

The outbreak of SARS, a life-threatening disease, has spread over many countries around the world. So far there is no effective drug for the treatment of SARS. Stimulated by the binding mechanism of SARS-CoV M(pro) with the octapeptide AVLQSGFR reported recently as well as the “Chou's distorted key” theory, we synthesized the octapeptide AVLQSGFR for conducting various biochemical experiments to investigate the antiviral potential of the octapeptide against SARS coronavirus (BJ-01). The results demonstrate that, compared with other compounds reported so far, AVLQSGFR is the most active in inhibiting replication of the SARS coronavirus, and that no detectable toxicity is observed on Vero cells under the condition of experimental concentration.

Expression of Hemagglutinin/Esterase by a Mouse Hepatitis Virus Coronavirus Defective–Interfering RNA Alters Viral Pathogenesis

Abstract A defective-interfering (DI) RNA of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was developed as a vector for expressing MHV hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) protein. The virus containing an expressed HE protein (A59-DE-HE) was generated by infecting cells with MHV-A59, which does not express HE, and transfecting thein vitro-transcribed DI RNA containing the HE gene. A similar virus (A59-DE-CAT) expressing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) was used as a control. These viruses were inoculated intracerebrally into mice, and the role of the HE protein in viral pathogenesis was evaluated. Results showed that all mice infected with parental A59 or A59-DE-CAT succumbed to infection by 9 days postinfection (p.i.), demonstrating that inclusion of the DI did not by itself alter pathogenesis. In contrast, 60% of mice infected with A59-DE-HE survived infection. HE- or CAT-specific subgenomic mRNAs were detected in the brains at days 1 and 2 p.i. but not later, indicating that the genes in the DI vector were expressed only in the early stage of viral infection. No significant difference in virus titer or viral antigen expression in brains was observed between A59-DE-HE- and A59-DE-CAT-infected mice, suggesting that virus replication in brain was not affected by the expression of HE. However, at day 3 p.i. there was a slight increase in the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration in the brains of the A59-DE-HE-infected mice. Surprisingly, virus titers in the livers of A59-DE-HE-infected mice were 3 log10lower than that of the A59-DE-CAT-infected mice at day 6 p.i. Also, substantially less necrosis and viral antigen were detected in the livers of the A59-DE-HE-infected mice. This may account for the reduced mortality of these mice. The possible contribution of the host immune system to this difference in pathogenesis was analyzed by comparing the expression of four cytokines. Results showed that both tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 mRNAs increased in the brains of the A59-DE-HE-infected mice at day 2 p.i., whereas interferon-γ and interleukin-1α mRNAs were similar between A59-DE-HE- and A59-DE-CAT-infected mice. These data suggest that the transient expression of HE protein enhances an early innate immune response, possibly contributing to the eventual clearance of virus from the liver. This study indicates the feasibility of the DI expression system for studying roles of viral proteins during MHV infection.

The DEAD-box RNA helicase 5 positively regulates the replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus by interacting with viral Nsp9 in vitro

Abstract The nonstructural protein 9 (Nsp9) of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been recognized to play important roles in viral replication. The present study first screened that the DEAD-box RNA helicase 5 (DDX5) was a cellular protein interacting with the Nsp9 of PRRSV by a yeast two-hybrid method in a pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) cDNA library. Next, DDX5 was shown to interact with viral Nsp9 in the co-transfected HEK293 cells with the DDX5- and Nsp9-expressing plasmids, and the interaction between endogenous DDX5 and Nsp9 was also confirmed in MARC-145 cells infected with the Nsp9-expressing lentiviruses. Then, the interacting domains between DDX5 and Nsp9 were determined to be the DEXDc and HELICc domains in DDX5 and the RdRp domain in Nsp9, respectively. Moreover, in the HEK293 cells, MARC-145 cells and PAM cell lines co-transfected with the DDX5- and Nsp9-expressing plasmids, Nsp9 was shown to co-localize with DDX5 in the cytoplasm with a perinuclear pattern, and meanwhile in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells and PAMs, endogenous DDX5 was also found to co-localize with Nsp9. Finally, silencing the DDX5 gene in MARC-145 cells significantly impacted the replication of PRRSV, and while the over-expression of DDX5 could slightly enhance viral replication. These findings indicate that DDX5 positively regulates the replication of PRRSV via its interaction with viral Nsp9 in vitro.

CT features of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia according to clinical presentation: a retrospective analysis of 120 consecutive patients from Wuhan city

OBJECTIVES: To characterize the chest computed tomography (CT) findings of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) according to clinical severity. We compared the CT features of common cases and severe cases, symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients, and febrile and afebrile patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of the clinical and thoracic CT features of 120 consecutive patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to a tertiary university hospital between January 10 and February 10, 2020, in Wuhan city, China. RESULTS: On admission, the patients generally complained of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and myalgia or fatigue, with diarrhea often present in severe cases. Severe patients were 20 years older on average and had comorbidities and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. There were no differences in the CT findings between asymptomatic and symptomatic common type patients or between afebrile and febrile patients, defined according to Chinese National Health Commission guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and CT features at admission may enable clinicians to promptly evaluate the prognosis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Clinicians should be aware that clinically silent cases may present with CT features similar to those of symptomatic common patients. KEY POINTS: • The clinical features and predominant patterns of abnormalities on CT for asymptomatic, typic common, and severe cases were summarized. These findings may help clinicians to identify severe patients quickly at admission. • Clinicians should be cautious that CT findings of afebrile/asymptomatic patients are not better than the findings of other types of patients. These patients should also be quarantined. • The use of chest CT as the main screening method in epidemic areas is recommended. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1007/s00330-020-06854-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Features of COVID-19 post-infectious cytokine release syndrome in children presenting to the emergency department

The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has not appeared to affect children as severely as adults. However, approximately 1 month after the COVID-19 peak in New York City in April 2020, cases of children with prolonged fevers abruptly developing inflammatory shock-like states have been reported in Western Europe and the United States. This case series describes four previously healthy children with COVID-19 infection confirmed by serologic antibody testing, but negative by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR swab, presenting to the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) with prolonged fever (5 or more days) and abrupt onset of hemodynamic instability with elevated serologic inflammatory markers and cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α). Emergency physicians must maintain a high clinical suspicion for this COVID-19 associated post-infectious cytokine release syndrome, with features that overlap with Kawasaki Disease (KD) and Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) in children with recent or current COVID-19 infection, as patients can decompensate quickly.

Haemagglutinin-esterase protein (HE) of murine corona virus: DVIMD (diarrhea virus of infant mice)

The acetylesterase (AE) activity of DVIM (diarrhea virus of infant mice) was assigned to the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein. The substrate specificity was examined using the natural substrate bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) and/or synthetic substrates p-nitrophenylacetate (p-NiA) and α-naphthylacetate (α-NA) and compared with several strains of MHV and influenza viruses. The AE of DVIM hydrolyzed the O-acetylester bond of BSM, and the two synthetic substrates p-NiA and α-NA in vitro. MHV-S reacted efficiently with both p-NiA and α-NA but less with BSM. Influenza virus (C/Miyagi/77) reacted with BSM efficiently, however reacted with p-NiA weakly, but not with α-NA at all. Thus, the AE-reactivity of DVIM was distinctly different from that of MHV-S and influenza C virus, suggesting that the AE of HE may have a modified function. Isolation of HE by the treatment with non ionic detergent NP40, resulted in globules approximately 5 nm in diameter. DVIM-binding proteins were demonstrated in the plasma membrane of mouse intestinal brush-border cells and hepatocytes. The same protein was recognized by MHV-S and MHV-4. The cell membranes obtained from these target tissues were substrates for the AE of DVIM. The biological importance of the HE protein for DVIM is discussed.

Assessment of knowledge, attitudes and perceptions regarding Ebola disease in healthcare workers from a tertiary care hospital in Romania

Abstract Objectives The National Institute for Infectious Diseases ‘Prof. Dr. Matei Balș’ was the designated centre for managing Ebola alerts in Romania during the 2014 African outbreak. We surveyed Ebola knowledge, attitudes and perceptions (KAP) among the institute's healthcare workers. Study design This was a cross-sectional survey. Methods The study consisted of a self-administered paper-based anonymous questionnaire that included 24 closed-item questions and two scales of personal concern. Results Respondents were generally well informed; compared to nurses, doctors recorded a 1.9-fold higher rate of correct responses regarding Ebola transmission (P < 0.001), but both nurses and doctors correctly identified Ebola's aetiological agent. Nurses perceived higher personal (P = 0.008) and family (P < 0.001) risk than doctors. Respondents reporting high perceived risks were more likely to be less informed about Ebola (P = 0.019) and its prevention options (P = 0.033). Males were 6.7-fold more likely to volunteer than females (P = 0.001) and so were graduates of higher rather than lower education (1.5-fold more likely, P = 0.017) and doctors than nurses (1.7-fold more likely, P = 0.018). The institute ranked first among sources of information on Ebola; respondents who had received Ebola training in the institute 2 years previously were 1.2–1.3 times more likely to correctly identify transmission routes. Conclusions We have characterised KAP on Ebola disease among Romanian healthcare workers from a tertiary care hospital in Bucharest. Nurses, specialist physicians and laboratory personnel may need more frequent retraining than residents and senior physicians.

Case reports study of the first five patients COVID-19 treated with remdesivir in France

Abstract The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak worldwide. Data on treatment are scare and parallels are made between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus. Remdesivir is a broad spectrum antiviral with efficient in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and controversial evidence of clinical improvement in severe COVID-19 patients. We aimed to describe the clinical outcome and virological monitoring of the first five COVID-19 patients admitted in ICU for severe pneumonia related to SARS-CoV-2 and treated with remdesivir in the University hospital of Bichat, Paris, France. SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR in blood plasma, lower and upper respiratory tract were monitored. Among the five treated patients, two needed mechanical ventilation and one high flow cannula oxygen. A significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 viral load from upper respiratory tract was observed in most cases but two died with active SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lower respiratory tract. Plasma samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in only one patient. Remdesivir was interrupted for side effects among four patients, including 2 ALT elevations (3 to 5 N) and 2 renal failures requiring renal replacement. This case series of five COVID-19 patients requiring ICU for a respiratory distress and treated with remdesivir, highlights the complexity of remdesivir use in such critically ill patients.

Deletion of both the Tyrosine-Based Endocytosis Signal and the Endoplasmic Reticulum Retrieval Signal in the Cytoplasmic Tail of Spike Protein Attenuates Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus in Pigs

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes high mortality in neonatal piglets. The PEDV spike (S) protein contains two intracellular sorting motifs, YxxΦ (tyrosine-based motif YEVF or YEAF) and KVHVQ at the cytoplasmic tail, yet their functions have not been fully elucidated. Some Vero cell-adapted and/or attenuated PEDV variants contain ablations in these two motifs. We hypothesized that these motifs contribute to viral pathogenicity. By transiently expressing PEDV S proteins with mutations in the motifs, we confirmed that the motif KVHVQ is involved in retention of the S proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). In addition, we showed that the YxxΦ motif triggers endocytosis of S proteins. These two motifs synergistically regulate the level of S expressed on the cell surface. To investigate their role in viral pathogenicity, we generated three recombinant PEDVs by introducing deletions or a mutation in the two motifs of the infectious clone of PEDV PC22A strain (icPC22A): (i) icΔ10aa (ΔYxxΦEKVHVQ), (ii) icΔ5aa (ΔKVHVQ), and (iii) icYA (Y1378A, to an inactivated motif, AEVF). Infection of Vero cells with icΔ10aa resulted in larger syncytia and more virions, with reduced numbers of S protein projections on the surface compared with icPC22A. Furthermore, we orally inoculated five groups of 5-day-old gnotobiotic piglets with the three mutants, icPC22A, or a mock treatment. Mutant icΔ10aa caused less severe diarrhea rate and significantly milder intestinal lesions than icPC22A, icΔ5aa, and icYA. These data suggest that the deletion of both motifs can reduce the virulence of PEDV in piglets. IMPORTANCE Many coronaviruses (CoVs) possess conserved motifs YxxΦ and/or KxHxx/KKxx in the cytoplasmic tail of the S protein. The KxHxx/KKxx motif has been identified as the ER retrieval signal, but the function of the YxxΦ motif in the intracellular sorting of CoV S proteins remains controversial. In this study, we showed that the YxxΦ of PEDV S protein is an endocytosis signal. Furthermore, using reverse genetics technology, we evaluated its role in PEDV pathogenicity in neonatal piglets. Our results explain one attenuation mechanism of Vero cell-adapted PEDV variants lacking functional YxxΦ and KVHVQ motifs. Knowledge from this study may aid in the design of efficacious live attenuated vaccines against PEDV, as well as other CoVs bearing the same motif in their S protein.

ACE for all – a molecular perspective

Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) is a zinc dependent dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase with an essential role in mammalian blood pressure regulation as part of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). As such, it has long been targeted in the treatment of hypertension through the use of ACE inhibitors. Although ACE has been studied since the 1950s, only recently have the full range of functions of this enzyme begun to truly be appreciated. ACE homologues have been found in a host of other organisms, and are now known to be conserved in insects. Insect ACE homologues typically share over 30 % amino acid sequence identity with human ACE. Given that insects lack a mammalian type circulatory system, they must have crucial roles in other physiological processes. The first ACE crystal structures were reported during the last decade and have enabled these enzymes to be studied from an entirely different perspective. Here we review many of these key developments and the implications that they have had on our understanding of the diverse functions of these enzymes. Specifically, we consider how structural information is being used in the design of a new generation of ACE inhibitors with increased specificity, and how the structures of ACE homologues are related to their functions. The Anopheles gambiae genome is predicted to code for ten ACE homologues, more than any genome studied so far. We have modelled the active sites of some of these as yet uncharacterised enzymes to try and infer more about their potential roles at the molecular level.

Cerebral pyogranuloma associated with systemic coronavirus infection in a ferret

A 2‐year‐old male ferret was presented with central nervous system signs. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain revealed a well‐defined contrast‐enhancing lesion on the rostral forebrain that appeared extraparenchymal. Surgical excision of the mass was performed and the ferret was euthanised during the procedure. Histopathology of the excised mass showed multiple meningeal nodular lesions with infiltrates of epithelioid macrophages, occasionally centred on degenerated neutrophils and surrounded by a broad rim of plasma cells, features consistent with pyogranulomatous meningitis. The histopathological features in this ferret were similar to those in cats with feline infectious peritonitis. Definitive diagnosis was assessed by immunohistochemistry, confirming a ferret systemic coronavirus (FSCV) associated disease. This is the first case of coronavirus granuloma described on CT‐scan in the central nervous system of a ferret.

Clinical characteristics of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) patients with gastrointestinal symptoms: A report of 164 cases

Abstract Objective To explore the clinical characteristics of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. Methods The clinical data of 164 COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms were extracted and analysed retrospectively. Results In total, 505 COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups: those with gastrointestinal symptoms (G group) and those without gastrointestinal symptoms (NG group). Common gastrointestinal symptoms included inappetence, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Significantly higher proportions of patients with fever, dizziness, myalgia, and fatigue were noted in group G than in group NG. Compared with patients without fever, there was a significant difference between G group and NG group in moderate fever or above, while there was no significant difference between the two groups in low fever. The laboratory results showed that patients in the G group had significantly higher C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase levels than those in the NG group. Moreover, the proportion of patients with severe pneumonia was significantly higher in the G group than in the NG group. Conclusion In Wuhan, the proportion of COVID-19 patients who experience gastrointestinal symptoms is relatively high. Patients who experience gastrointestinal symptoms are more likely to suffer from severe pneumonia, which may help clinicians identify patients at high risk of COVID-19 and thus reduce the incidence of this condition.

Transitional changes in the incidence of hip osteonecrosis among renal transplant recipients

Abstract Background Immunosuppressive therapy for renal allograft recipients has changed substantially since the introduction of the anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody, basiliximab. We hypothesized that recent improvements in immunosuppressive treatment may reduce the incidence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). This study aimed to investigate transitional changes in the incidence of OFNH among renal transplant recipients by MRI. Methods Participants comprised 110 patients who had undergone renal transplantation from 2003 to 2012, during which time basiliximab was in regular use at our institute (Recent group), and 232 patients who had undergone RT between 1986 and 2003 (Past group). We compared ONFH incidence between the two groups and evaluated risk factors for ONFH, including immunosuppressants (calcineurin inhibitors, basiliximab, and/or steroids) and postoperative renal function. Results Incidence of ONFH was lower in the Recent group (0%) than in the Past group (3.4%; p = 0.043). In the Recent group, age was greater, ABO/human leukocyte antigen incompatibility was worse, while steroid dose was decreased and post-transplant renal function was improved. Cumulative methylprednisolone dose at postoperative week 2 and delayed graft function were identified as risk factors for ONFH. Conclusion Risk of ONFH after renal transplantation has fallen with the advent of regular use of basiliximab, although this agent does not appear to be a factor directly associated with the incidence of ONFH. Study design Clinical prognostic study (Level III case control study).

Synthesis of (R)- and (S)-β-hydroxyphosphonate acyclonucleosides: structural analogues of Adefovir (PMEA)

Abstract A synthetic pathway to new acyclonucleoside phosphonates, as analogues of Adefovir, is described. The reduction of an acyclonucleoside β-ketophosphonate, readily available from the nucleobase and benzylacrylate, afforded a mixture of (R)- and (S)-β-hydroxyphosphonate derivatives which was resolved. The assignment of the absolute configuration was proposed on the basis of NMR studies and was supported by molecular modelling studies.

Collaborative Research Approaches to the Role of Wildlife in Zoonotic Disease Emergence

Emerging infectious diseases are a key threat to public health and the majority are caused by zoonotic pathogens. Here we discuss new collaborative approaches to understanding the process of zoonotic disease emergence that link veterinary medicine, public health, and ecological approaches: conservation medicine and one health. We demonstrate how studies on the underlying drivers of disease emergence (bushmeat hunting, wildlife trade, and deforestation) can provide ways to model, predict, and ultimately prevent zoonotic disease emergence and spread.

Potent Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibodies Directed to Multiple Epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic rages on with devasting consequences on human lives and the global economy. The discovery and development of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this novel coronavirus. Here we report the isolation of 61 SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from 5 infected patients hospitalized with severe disease. Among these are 19 antibodies that potently neutralized the authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, 9 of which exhibited exquisite potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 1 to 9 ng/mL. Epitope mapping showed this collection of 19 antibodies to be about equally divided between those directed to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those to the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are quite immunogenic. In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that are overlapping with the domains at the top of the spike. Cyro-electron microscopy structures of one antibody targeting RBD, a second targeting NTD, and a third bridging RBD and NTD revealed recognition of the closed, “all RBD-down” conformation of the spike. Several of these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2 Infection with Different Radiological Insights

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel viral infection characterized by several symptoms range from mild to severe clinical conditions that could lead to death. We report two different radiological findings on computed tomography (CT) in two patients affected by SARS-CoV-2: a lung acute embolism (APE) in the first case and a radiological picture of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the second case. This is an important issue to be identified in order to provide more specific therapy earlier, including both antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs associated with anti anticoagulant therapy.

The relationship between antibody status to bovine corona virus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus and disease incidence, reproduction and herd characteristics in dairy herds

BACKGROUND: Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine corona virus (BCV) affects cattle worldwide. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of these infections on general health and reproduction parameters measurable on herd level and to explore the association between antibody status and some herd characteristics. METHODS: We collected a pooled milk sample from five primiparous cows from 79 Swedish dairy herds in September 2006. The samples were analysed for immunoglobulin G antibodies to BCV and BRSV with indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Herd level data from 1 September 2005 to 30 August 2006 were accessed retrospectively. The location of the herds was mapped using a geographical information system. RESULTS: Ten herds were antibody negative to both viruses and were compared with 69 herds positive to BCV or BRSV or both. Positive herds had a higher (P = 0.001) bulk tank milk somatic cell count (BMSCC) compared with negative herds. The medians for all other analyzed health and reproductive parameters were consistently in favour of the herds negative to both viruses although the differences were not statistically significant. A higher proportion (P = 0.01) of herds used professional technicians for artificial insemination, rather than farm personnel, amongst the 33 herds negative to BCV compared with the 46 positive herds. CONCLUSIONS: Our result shows that herds that were antibody positive to BCV and/or BRSV had a higher BMSCC compared with herds negative to BCV and BRSV. There was also tendency that negative herds had a better general herd health compared with positive. A higher proportion amongst the BCV negative herds used external technicians for AI instead of farm personnel, indicating that it is possible to avoid infection although having regular visits. Negative herds were located in close proximity to positive herds, indicating that local spread and airborne transmission between herds might not be of great importance and that herds can stay free from these infection transmission although virus is circulating in the area.

FIP: a novel approach to vaccination Proceedings from the 2nd International FCoV/FIP Symposium, Glasgow, 4–7 August 2002

Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal disease of cats. Early attempts at vaccination have been unsuccessful, some even serving to exacerbate the disease through antibody-dependent enhancement. Replication-incompetent feline foamy virus (FFV) transducing vectors are being developed as potential vaccine agents, into which immunogenic fragments of feline coronavirus (FCoV) proteins will be inserted. To use a recombinant viral vector to express FCoV proteins, the agent chosen should be apathogenic and replication incompetent within the host following gene delivery. Spumaviruses confer several advantages over the more traditionally explored retroviral vectors. Stable helper cell line clones have been established by transfection of CRFK cells with FFV tas and assessed using β-galactosidase assays, PCR, immunofluorescence and western blotting. The generation of infectious virions using these cell lines has been investigated using tas-deleted FFV vectors containing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) cassette.

Microarray and real-time RT-PCR analyses of differential human gene expression patterns induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus infection of Vero cells

Abstract Vero E6 African green monkey kidney cells are highly susceptible to infection with the newly emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and they are permissive for rapid viral replication, with resultant cytopathic effects. We employed cDNA microarray analysis to characterize the cellular transcriptional responses of homologous human genes at 12 h post-infection. Seventy mRNA transcripts belonging to various functional classes exhibited significant alterations in gene expression. There was considerable induction of heat shock proteins that are crucial to the immune response mechanism. Modified levels of several transcripts involved in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes exemplified the balance between opposing forces during SARS pathogenesis. Other genes displaying altered transcription included those associated with host translation, cellular metabolism, cell cycle, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, protein trafficking, protein modulators, and cytoskeletal proteins. Alterations in the levels of several novel transcripts encoding hypothetical proteins and expressed sequence tags were also identified. In addition, transcription of apoptosis-related genes DENN and hIAP1 was upregulated in contrast to FAIM. Elevated Mx1 expression signified a strong host response to mediate antiviral resistance. Also expressed in infected cells was the C-terminal alternative splice variant of the p53 tumor suppressor gene encoding a modified truncated protein that can influence the activity of wild-type p53. We observed the interplay between various mechanisms to favor virus multiplication before full-blown apoptosis and the triggering of several pathways in host cells in an attempt to eliminate the pathogen. Microarray analysis identifies the critical host–pathogen interactions during SARS-CoV infection and provides new insights into the pathophysiology of SARS.

A field‐deployable insulated isothermal RT‐PCR assay for identification of influenza A (H7N9) shows good performance in the laboratory

BACKGROUND: Avian influenza A (H7N9) remains circulating in China. For countries at risk of introduction of H7N9, such as Vietnam, early detection of H7N9 virus is essential for the early containment of the virus. Insulated isothermal reverse transcriptase PCR (iiRT‐PCR) is a portable PCR system that can be deployed under field conditions to identify pathogens at the sampling site. Applying PCR at the sampling site will greatly reduce the time to obtain a diagnostic result which allows the veterinary authority to take immediate action to contain disease spreading. OBJECTIVE: To determine analytical and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the portable iiRT‐PCR for H7N9 virus detection. METHODS: A panel of 59 virus isolates, including H7N9, avian influenza viruses of subtype H1 to H13, swine and human influenza viruses, Newcastle disease virus, and infectious bursal disease virus, were tested by H7 and N9 iiRT‐PCR reagents, using probes and primers specific to H7 or N9, in comparison with laboratory‐based real‐time RT‐PCR assays to determine analytical sensitivity and specificity. Fifty oropharyngeal samples from experimentally infected chicken and ducks with H7N9 and 50 non‐infected control swabs were tested by the H7 iiRT‐PCR to determine diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: The H7 and N9 iiRT‐PCR reagents yielded comparable levels of analytical sensitivity and specificity with real‐time RT‐PCR for the detection of H7N9 virus. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of H7 iiRT‐PCR were 98% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The observed high sensitivity and specificity of iiRT‐PCR for H7N9 detection show its potential for early detection of H7N9 in risk‐based surveillance.

SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed only by cell culture isolation before the local outbreak in an Italian seven-week-old suckling baby

SARS-CoV-2 is emerged in China on December 2019 and now declared pandemic by WHO. We describe the case of an Italian 7-week-old suckling baby SARS-CoV-2-positive only by cell culture method with no clinical suspicion and/or risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient was referred to the hospital with signs and symptoms of infection of the upper respiratory tract before the virus was spread to the province. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs and a nasopharyngeal aspirate were used for conventional and molecular diagnostic assays not including SARS-CoV-2 virus. Bacteria referred to resident population were revealed in nasal and pharyngeal swabs. No viruses were detected using both immunofluorescence assay and nucleic acid amplification assays in the nasopharyngeal aspirate. The baby was discharged in good conditions after 3 days of hospitalization. Later a cytopathic effect on the cell monolayers currently used for respiratory viruses was observed and the viral particles were identified as Coronaviridae by transmission electron microscopy. SARS-CoV-2 was identified by RT-PCR performed both on cell culture and on the stored aliquot of the original sample. The virus isolate was named SARS-Cov-2/human/Parma/1/2020.Cell culture still remains the only reference diagnostic method also for emerging viruses, allowing to reveal cytopathogenic viruses and demonstrating their infectivity.

Detection of viral agents in fecal specimens of monkeys with diarrhea

Background Diarrheal disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in humans and animals, including non human primates. While the diagnostics for gastrointestinal bacterial and parasitic pathogens and their etiological role in disease are well established, little is known about the epidemiology, prevalence and role of viral agents in diarrheal illness among monkeys. Methods We collected fecal specimens from monkeys with diarrhea that were housed in two primate colonies, the Institute of Laboratory Animal Sciences, Beijing, China and the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Georgia, USA. We screened these fecal specimens for rotaviruses and enteric adenoviruses 40/41 by using commercial EIA kits (Rotaclone and Adenoclone), enteroviruses by RT‐PCR and Southern blot hybridization, and picobirnaviruses by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Some of the specimens were examined by EM for coronaviruses and noroviruses. Results Of the 92 specimens from China, we found 63 (68%) positive for viruses, including enteroviruses (52%), enteric adenoviruses (21%), rotaviruses (20%), and picobirnaviruses (2%). Coronaviruses were detected in some specimens. Mixed infection of two or more viral agents was seen in 23 (25%) specimens. In the US collection, we detected enteroviruses and enteric adenoviruses in 76% (45/59) and 14% (7/50) of the specimens, respectively. Electron microscopy showed norovirus‐like particles in some specimens from both colonies. Conclusions Our findings indicate endemic infections with enteric viruses in monkeys of both colonies. The availability of new simian rotaviruses, enteric adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and coronaviruses and the discovery of noroviruses and picobirnaviruses may allow us to develop better diagnostics for these agents and determine which of these agents are clearly associated with gastroenteritis in monkeys.

Spatial Analysis of Global Variability in Covid-19 Burden

BACKGROUND: Since the first occurrence of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), a number of online tools have become available to assist with tracking Covid-19 prevalence. Yet we are unaware of resources that provide country-specific Covid-19 incidence data. METHODS: We undertook a descriptive analysis of the global impact of Covid-19 using data reported on March 17, 2020. The prevalence of Covid-19 cases, fatalities attributed to Covid-19, and the case fatality rate for each of the 238 countries were accessed from the World Health Organization global Covid-19 tracking site, and we additionally calculated Covid-19 incidence based on country-specific population data. We determined the country-specific point prevalence and incidence of Covid-19 and associated deaths while using geocoded data to display their spatial distribution with geographic heat maps. RESULTS: The analysis included 193,197 Covid-19 cases and 7859 associated deaths. The point prevalence was highest in China (80,881), Italy (31,506), Iran (16,169), and Spain (11,312); no other country reported more than 10,000 cases. The incidence (per million population) was highest in San Marino (3389) followed by Iceland (645) and Italy (521); no other country had an incidence above 400 per million population. CONCLUSION: Countries with a high Covid-19 prevalence may not have a high incidence, and vice versa. Public health agencies that provide real-time infection tracking tools should report country-specific Covid-19 incidence metrics, in addition to prevalence data.

Neutralizing antibody responses to enterovirus and adenovirus in healthy adults in China

Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is an important public health problem that has emerged over the past several years. HFMD predominantly infects children under seven years old and occasionally causes severe disease in adults. Among the enteroviruses, enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus 16 (CA16) are the major causative agents of HFMD. In addition, adenovirus cocirculates with enterovirus and has become a possible additional pathogenic factor for HFMD in some cases. Here, we have investigated the neutralizing antibody responses to both enterovirus and adenovirus in adults, with the aim of exploring the prevalence trends of these viruses and the nature of protective immunity in humans to these viral infections. Sera from 391 healthy adults from 21 provinces and cities in China were tested for the presence of antibodies against EV71, CA16, adenovirus human serotype 5 (AdHu5) and chimpanzee adenovirus pan7 (AdC7) using neutralization tests. High seroprevalence rates of EV71, CA16 and AdHu5 were found in the population (85.7%, 58.8% and 74.2%, respectively). The coseropositivity rate of these three viruses was 39.4% (154 of 391), with median neutralizing antibody titers of 80, 40 and 640, respectively, and the neutralizing antibody titer for EV71 was found to be correlated with those of CA16 and AdHu5. AdC7 was found to be a rare adenovirus serotype in the human population, with a seropositivity rate of 11.8%, suggesting that it could be a good choice for a vaccine carrier that could be used in vaccine development.

Experimental co-infection of infectious bronchitis and low pathogenic avian influenza H9N2 viruses in commercial broiler chickens

Abstract In this study, commercial broilers were experimentally infected with single (classical IBV, variant IBV or AIV-H9N2) or mixed AIV-H9N2 with classical, variant or vaccine strains of IBV. Birds were monitored for clinical and pathological outcomes and virus shedding for 10days post infection (DPI). Clinical signs were limited to the respiratory tract in all challenged groups and varied from mild to moderate mouth breathing to severe respiratory signs with snorting sound and extended head. Mortalities were only recorded in mixed AIV-H9N2/variant IBV challenge group. AIV-H9N2 challenge caused tracheal petechial hemorrhage that progressed to tracheal congestion and caseation. In mixed AIV-H9N2/IBV vaccine challenge, severe tracheitis with bronchial cast formation was observed. In mixed AIV-H9N2/variant IBV challenge severe congestion of the tracheal mucosa and excessive exudates with a tendency to form tubular casts were observed. Kidney ureate deposition was only observed in variant IBV challenge group. Histopathologically, tracheal congestion, severe degeneration, and deciliation were noticed in all groups of mixed infection. Interestingly, hemorrhage and atrophy were observed in thymus gland of birds challenged with single AIV-H9N2 or mixed AIV-H9N2/IBV. There was no difference in the tracheal shedding level of variant IBV between single and mixed infected groups while classical IBV shedding increased in mixed infection group. Interestingly, the AIV-H9N2 showed constantly high shedding titers till 7DPI with variant or vaccine IBV co-infection. In conclusion, co-infection of IBV and AIV-H9N2 induced severe clinical outcome and high mortality. Also, IBV co-infection increased the shedding of AIV-H9N2 in experimentally infected birds.

Antimicrobial, Antiviral and Immunomodulatory Activity Studies of Pelargonium sidoides (EPs(®) 7630) in the Context of Health Promotion

Pelargonium species contribute significantly to the health care of a large population in the Southern African region, as part of a long-standing medical system intimately linked to traditional healing practices. Most notably, extracts of the roots of P. sidoides have commonly been applied for the treatment of dysentery and diarrhoea but only occasionally for respiratory complaints. Clinical trials have shown that a modern aqueous-ethanolic formulation of P. sidoides extracts (EPs(®) 7630) is an efficacious treatment for disorders of the respiratory tract, for example bronchitis and sinusitis. It should be noted that EPs(®) 7630 is the most widely investigated extract and therefore is the focus of this review. In order to provide a rationale for its therapeutic activity extracts have been evaluated for antibacterial activity and for their effects on non-specific immune functions. Only moderate direct antibacterial capabilities against a spectrum of bacteria, including Mycobacteria strains, have been noted. In contrast, a large body of in vitro studies has provided convincing evidence for an anti-infective principle associated with activation of the non-specific immune system. Interestingly, significant inhibition of interaction between bacteria and host cells, a key to the pathogenesis of respiratory tract infections, has emerged from recent studies. In addition, antiviral effects have been demonstrated, including inhibition of the replication of respiratory viruses and the enzymes haemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Besides, an increase of cilliary beat frequency of respiratory cells may contribute to the beneficial effects of P. sidoides extracts. This example provides a compelling argument for continuing the exploration of Nature and traditional medical systems as a source of therapeutically useful herbal medicines.

Changes in pulmonary tuberculosis prevalence: evidence from the 2010 population survey in a populous province of China

BACKGROUND: This paper reports findings from the prevalence survey conducted in Shandong China in 2010, a province with a population of 94 million. This study aimed to estimate TB prevalence of the province in 2010 in comparison with the 2000 survey; and to compare yields of TB cases from different case finding approaches. METHODS: A population based, cross-sectional survey was conducted using multi-stage random cluster sampling. 54,279 adults participated in the survey with a response rate of 96%. Doctors interviewed and classified participants as suspected TB cases if they presented with persistent cough, abnormal chest X-ray (CXRAY), or both. Three sputum specimens of all suspected cases were collected and sent for smear microscopy and culture. RESULTS: Adjusted prevalence rate of bacteriologically confirmed cases was 34 per 100,000 for adults in Shandong in 2010. Compared to the 2000 survey, TB prevalence has declined by 80%. 53% of bacteriologically confirmed cases did not present persistent cough. The yield of bacteriologically confirmed cases was 47% by symptom screening and 95% by CXRAY. Over 50% of TB cases were among over 65’s. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rate of bacteriologically confirmed cases was significantly reduced compared with 2000. The survey raised challenges to identify TB cases without clear symptoms.

COVID‐19 pandemic and Zagreb earthquakes as stressors in patients with temporomandibular disorders

Stress refers to situations in which one feels that the demands imposed on them exceed the limitations of their ability to adapt. This causes a series of adverse consequences among which is compromised health (Lazarus and Folkman, 1984). On 11th March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the pandemic status of COVID‐19 diseases, leading to the European Union states imposing the lockdown, Croatia being one among them. Infection prevention became the nation's most important goal, and people had to change their day‐to‐day habits.

Identification of aberrantly expressed of serum microRNAs in patients with hormone-induced non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head

Abstract Objective The non-translation RNA-microRNA (miRNA) has been demonstrated to correlate to various disease occurrence in body. Serum miRNA was gradually considered as molecular markers for disease diagnosis. This study was designed to analyze differential serum miRNAs level in hormone-induced non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (hormone-NOFH) patients. Methods We selected 30 patients with hormone-NOFH as case group, and 30 healthy volunteers were recruited as control group. miRCURYTM LNA miRNA chip and quantitative RT-PCR were used to examine differential miRNAs expression. Correlation assay was performed between miRNAs and NOFH trait. Results We found that 9 miRNAs were upregulated while 3 miRNAs were downregulated in hormone-TOFH patient serum by result of miRNA chip. QRT-PCR assay revealed that the level of miR-423-5p was significantly increased and miR-10a-5p was significantly decreased. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we observed that miR-423-5p serum level is positive association to FHC levels whereas miR-10a-5p has no association with FHC levels. Furthermore, miR-423-5p is negatively correlated to its downstream molecule-adiponectin. Conclusion We report a miRNA profile of hormone-NOFH and provide a new perspective to understand this intricate disease. This novel information suggests the potential roles of miR-423-5p in the diagnosis, prognosis biomarkers, or therapy targets of hormone-NOFH.

Respiratory virus associated with surgery in children patients

BACKGROUND: Viral respiratory infection (VRI) is a common contraindication to elective surgery. Asymptomatic shedding among pediatric surgery patients (PSPs) could potentially lead to progression of symptomatic diseases and cause outbreaks of respiratory diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of infection among mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group after surgical procedure. METHODS: We collected the induced sputum from enrolled 1629 children (under 18 years of age) with no respiratory symptom prior to pediatric surgery between March 2017 and February 2019. We tested 16 different respiratory virus infections in post-surgery mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group using a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay panel. We analyzed symptom data and quantitative viral load to investigate the association between viruses, symptoms and viral quantity in qRT-PCR-positive PSPs. RESULTS: Out of 1629 children enrolled, a total of 204 respiratory viruses were present in 171 (10.50%) PSPs including 47 patients with mild symptoms and 124 with no symptoms after surgery. Commonly detected viruses were human rhino/enterovirus (HRV/EV, 42.19%), parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3, 24.48%), coronavirus (CoV NL63, OC43, HKU1, 11.46%), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 9.9%). PIV3 infection with a higher viral load was frequently found in PSPs presenting with mild symptoms, progressing to pneumonia with radiographic evidence after surgery. HRV/EV were the most commonly detected pathogens in both asymptomatic and mild symptomatic PSPs. CoV (OC43, HKU1) infections with a higher viral load were mostly observed in asymptomatic PSPs progressing to alveolar or interstitial infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that PIV3 is a new risk factor for VRI in PSPs. Employing a more comprehensive, sensitive and quantitative method should be considered for preoperative testing of respiratory viruses in order to guide optimal surgical timing.

Biopotency Assays: an Integrated Application to Quality Control of Chinese Materia Medica

Abstract The current quality control (QC) pattern for Chinese materia medica (CMM) lacks suitable methods and indicators to evaluate their safety and efficacy effectively, which impedes the smooth development of CMM. In this review, main problems of the current QC pattern for CMM, principally focused on the content determination of constituents, were summarized and the inspiration from the QC of biological products was introduced. With the aim at introducing a suitable tool to the QC of CMM, biopotency assay and its feasibility in the QC pattern for CMM were analyzed and confirmed by relevant researches with years of practice. From the applications of biopotency assays in the QC of CMM in the last 10 years, we propose that biopotency assays should be an integral part of the QC pattern for CMM, for these assays can make the QC indicators related to the clinical safety and efficacy, supplementing the existed QC system of CMM.

Noncutaneous considerations of COVID‐19 for dermatology practices

COVID‐19 presents many pressing challenges to the global dermatological community and our patients with ongoing skin needs, which must be considered by every dermatology provider. Many of these are logistical and administrative, distinct from physical manifestations, and could be summarized by the acronym COVID (Consultations, Operations, Videoconferencing, Immunosuppressive medications, Drug and equipment shortages). While the pandemic may represent a threat to many parts of our existence, dermatologists can help the patients we care for by considering noncutaneous implications of COVID‐19 upon our practice.

Nanoyeast and Other Cell Envelope Compositions for Protein Studies and Biosensor Applications

[Image: see text] Rapid progress in disease biomarker discovery has increased the need for robust detection technologies. In the past several years, the designs of many immunoaffinity reagents have focused on lowering costs and improving specificity while also promoting stability. Antibody fragments (scFvs) have long been displayed on the surface of yeast and phage libraries for selection; however, the stable production of such fragments presents challenges that hamper their widespread use in diagnostics. Membrane and cell wall proteins similarly suffer from stability problems when solubilized from their native environment. Recently, cell envelope compositions that maintain membrane proteins in native or native-like lipid environment to improve their stability have been developed. This cell envelope composition approach has now been adapted toward stabilizing antibody fragments by retaining their native cell wall environment. A new class of immunoaffinity reagents has been developed that maintains antibody fragment attachment to yeast cell wall. Herein, we review recent strategies that incorporate cell wall fragments with functional scFvs, which are designed for easy production while maintaining specificity and stability when in use with simple detection platforms. These cell wall based antibody fragments are globular in structure, and heterogeneous in size, with fragments ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers in size. These fragments appear to retain activity once immobilized onto biosensor surfaces for the specific and sensitive detection of pathogen antigens. They can be quickly and economically generated from a yeast display library and stored lyophilized, at room temperature, for up to a year with little effect on stability. This new format of scFvs provides stability, in a simple and low-cost manner toward the use of scFvs in biosensor applications. The production and “panning” of such antibody cell wall composites are also extremely facile, enabling the rapid adoption of stable and inexpensive affinity reagents for emerging infectious threats.

The estimation of SARS incubation distribution from serial interval data using a convolution likelihood

The incubation period of SARS is the time between infection of disease and onset of symptoms. Knowledge about the distribution of incubation times is crucial in determining the length of quarantine period and is an important parameter in modelling the spread and control of SARS. As the exact time of infection is unknown for most patients, the incubation time cannot be determined. What is observable is the serial interval which is the time from the onset of symptoms in an index case to the onset of symptoms in a subsequent case infected by the index case. By constructing a convolution likelihood based on the serial interval data, we are able to estimate the incubation distribution which is assumed to be Weibull, and justifications are given to support this choice over other distributions. The method is applied to data provided by the Ministry of Health of Singapore and the results justify the choice of a ten‐day quarantine period. The indirect estimate obtained using the method of convolution likelihood is validated by means of comparison with a direct estimate obtained directly from a subset of patients for whom the incubation time can be ascertained. Despite its name, the proposed indirect estimate is actually more precise than the direct estimate because serial interval data are recorded for almost all patients, whereas exact incubation times can be determined for only a small subset. It is possible to obtain an even more efficient estimate by using the combined data but the improvement is not substantial. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Going Online for Groceries: Drivers of Category-Level Share of Wallet Expansion

Abstract Some grocery product categories may be more successful than others in terms of stimulating consumers to increase their share of wallet (SoW) when they start buying through the online channel of a grocery chain. This study explores the circumstances in which online and multichannel marketing mix instruments determine the extent of category-level SoW expansion. To do so, the authors use U.K. household scanner panel data, covering online and offline purchases by 3,311 households in 59 categories of four multichannel retail chains. The results indicate that the effectiveness of online and multichannel marketing mix instruments for stimulating expansion is moderated by category characteristics, such that a selective approach to making decisions about the online price, online assortment breadth, online/offline assortment integration, and online national brand proliferation, tuned to account for category differences, can increase category-level SoW for the online-visited chain.

Identification of porcine circovirus type 2 in retrospective cases of pigs naturally infected with porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus

Abstract The identification of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) was studied in fresh intestinal tissues by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in formalin-fixed, paraffin-wax-embedded intestinal tissues by in situ hybridisation. The tissues came from pigs naturally infected with porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV). A total of 35 (32.7%) of 107 small intestinal samples from pigs naturally infected with PEDV were found to be positive using PCR. Positive signals for PCV2 were detected in 32 (29.9%) of 107 small intestinal samples from pigs naturally infected with PEDV by in situ hybridisation. The distribution of positive cells in the jejunum and ileum was multifocal or patchy. Distinct positive labelling was found throughout the lamina propria in the small intestines. The results of this study indicate that PCV2 is highly prevalent in pigs naturally infected with PEDV.

2019-novel coronavirus outbreak: A new challenge

OBJECTIVES: Following the public health emergency declared by the World Health Organization and the recent outbreak by 2019-nCoV in China and through other 29 countries, we aimed to summarize the clinical aspects of novel beta-coronavirus infection and its possible clinical presentations together with suggested therapeutic algorithms for patients who may require antibiotic treatment. METHODS: We reviewed the currently available literature of microbiologically confirmed infections by 2019-ConV (or COVID-19) occurred at the time of writing (13 February 2020). A literature search was performed using the PubMed database and the Cochrane library. Search terms included "novel coronavirus" or "2019-nCoV" or “COVID-19”. RESULTS: Published cases occurred mostly in males (age ranged from 8 to 92). Cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine system diseases were commonly reported, except previous chronic pulmonary diseases (e.g., COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis) that were surprisingly underreported. Fever was presented in all the case series available, flanked by cough, dyspnea, myalgias and fatigue. Multiple bilateral lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground-glass opacities were the main reported radiological features of 2019-nCoV, at least in the early phases of disease. CONCLUSIONS: The new 2019-nCoV epidemics is mainly associated with respiratory disease and few extrapulmonary signs. However, there is a low rate of associated pre-existing respiratory comorbidities.

Antigenicity of the peplomer protein of infectious bronchitis virus

Abstract To study the antigenic structure of the peplomer protein of the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus, fragments from the peplomer gene were generated by restriction-enzyme cleavage or by limited DNase digestion and inserted in the Escherichia coli expression plasrnid pEX (Stanley and Luzio, 1984). The antigenicity of the expression products was tested using a number of polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies. The polyclonal antisera recognized different sets of epitopes in the 1162-residue sequence. The N-terminal region of one of the two subunits, S2, was recognized by all polyclonal sera and by two monoclonal antibodies. This clearly immunodominant region contains at least two adjacent or overlapping epitopes, one of which has been localized within 18 residues. The epitopes found as antigenic pEX expression products do not coincide with the regions in the S1 subunit that have been found to contain hypervariable sequences. We suggest that these regions constitute conformation dependent neutralization epitopes that cannot be detected in the pEX system. The relevance of our finclings for vaccine development is discussed.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, and extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Escherichia coli in the community: Assessing the problem and controlling the spread

Although health care-associated methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and clostridium difficile strains are primarily a risk to hospital patients, people are increasingly concerned about their potential to circulate in the community and the home. They are thus looking for support in order to understand the extent of the risk, and guidance on how to deal with situations where preventing infection from these species becomes their responsibility. A further concern are the community-acquired MRSA and C. difficile strains, and other antibiotic resistant strains circulating in the community such as the Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli. In response to concerns about such organisms in the community, the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene has produced a report evaluating MRSA, C. difficile, and ESBL-producing E. coli from a community viewpoint. The report summarizes what is known about their prevalence in the community, their mode of transmission in the home, and the extent to which they represent a risk. It also includes “advice sheets” giving practical guidance on what to do when there is a risk of infection transmission in the home.

Human Metapneumovirus–Associated Lower Respiratory Tract Infections among Hospitalized Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1)–Infected and HIV-1–Uninfected African Infants

Respiratory tract infections due to human metapneumovirus (hMPV) have been reported worldwide, with the exception of Africa. The prevalence of hMPV infection was studied among human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)–infected and HIV-1–uninfected African infants who were hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples obtained from 81 HIV-1–infected and 110 HIV-1–uninfected infants who had tested negative for other respiratory viruses were selected for investigation. hMPV was detected in 10 HIV-1–uninfected infants (9.1%) and 3 HIV-1–infected infants (3.7%). Compared with the entire cohort of HIV-1–uninfected infants, hMPV was 4.6-fold less common than respiratory syncytial virus, but it was 3.2-fold more common than influenza virus and 2.1-fold more common than parainfluenza virus types 1–3. Genotyping of 7 of 14 isolates revealed the circulation of 2 major phylogenetic groups of the virus, which were similar to those described in North America and Europe.

Temporal relationship between antibiotic use and respiratory virus activities in the Republic of Korea: a time-series analysis

BACKGROUND: Inappropriate use of antibiotics increases resistance and reduces their effectiveness. Despite evidence-based guidelines, antibiotics are still commonly used to treat infections likely caused by respiratory viruses. In this study, we examined the temporal relationships between antibiotic usage and respiratory infections in the Republic of Korea. METHODS: The number of monthly antibiotic prescriptions and the incidence of acute respiratory tract infections between 2010 and 2015 at all primary care clinics were obtained from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. The monthly detection rates of respiratory viruses, including adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, human coronavirus, and human rhinovirus, were collected from Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cross-correlation analysis was conducted to quantify the temporal relationship between antibiotic use and respiratory virus activities as well as respiratory infections in primary clinics. RESULTS: The monthly use of different classes of antibiotic, including penicillins, other beta-lactam antibacterials, macrolides and quinolones, was significantly correlated with influenza virus activity. These correlations peaked at the 0-month lag with cross-correlation coefficients of 0.45 (p < 0.01), 0.46 (p < 0.01), 0.40 (p < 0.01), and 0.35 (< 0.01), respectively. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between acute bronchitis and antibiotics, including penicillin (0.73, p < 0.01), macrolides (0.74, p < 0.01), and quinolones (0.45, p < 0.01), at the 0-month lag. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there is a significant temporal relationship between influenza virus activity and antibiotic use in primary clinics. This relationship indicates that interventions aimed at reducing influenza cases in addition to effort to discourage the prescription of antibiotics by physicians may help to decrease unnecessary antibiotic consumption.

Temporal dynamics of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in the Arabian Peninsula, 2012–2017

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) remains a notable disease and poses a significant threat to global public health. The Arabian Peninsula is considered a major global epicentre for the disease and the virus has crossed regional and continental boundaries since 2012. In this study, we focused on exploring the temporal dynamics of MERS-CoV in human populations in the Arabian Peninsula between 2012 and 2017, using publicly available data on case counts and combining two analytical methods. Disease progression was assessed by quantifying the time-dependent reproductive number (TD-Rs), while case series temporal pattern was modelled using the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). We accounted for geographical variability between three major affected regions in Saudi Arabia including Eastern Province, Riyadh and Makkah. In Saudi Arabia, the epidemic size was large with TD-Rs >1, indicating significant spread until 2017. In both Makkah and Riyadh regions, the epidemic progression reached its peak in April 2014 (TD-Rs > 7), during the highest incidence period of MERS-CoV cases. In Eastern Province, one unique super-spreading event (TD-R > 10) was identified in May 2013, which comprised of the most notable cases of human-to-human transmission. Best-fitting ARIMA model inferred statistically significant biannual seasonality in Riyadh region, a region characterised by heavy seasonal camel-related activities. However, no statistical evidence of seasonality was identified in Eastern Province and Makkah. Instead, both areas were marked by an endemic pattern of cases with sporadic outbreaks. Our study suggested new insights into the epidemiology of the virus, including inferences about epidemic progression and evidence for seasonality. Despite the inherent limitations of the available data, our conclusions provide further guidance to currently implement risk-based surveillance in high-risk populations and, subsequently, improve related interventions strategies against the epidemic at country and regional levels.

Épidémiologie des pneumopathies communautaires de l'enfant. Données actuelles

Summary Viruses, particularly syncitial respiratory virus, are the main aetiology of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in infants, while bacterial agents are more frequently responsible in children older than 3 years. Antimicrobial therapy must take into account the development of reduced susceptibility of penicillin to strains of Straptoccocus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae with β-lactamase, and high frequency of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae infections. Although the mortality rate has remained low in France, the morbidity appeared to increase in recent years.

COVID-19 in lung transplant patients: a case series.

Several case reports and small case series have been published on COVID-19 infection after solid organ transplantation, however, thus far there are limited data on COVID-19 infections in lung transplant patients. In the present single center case series we discuss 10 lung transplant patients with a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, diagnosed with nasophanryngeal swab in 8 and broncho-alveolar lavage in 2. Eight /10 patients needed hospital admission, of whom 1 in the intensive care unit. He died after 2 weeks from multiple organ failure. The remaining 9 patients recovered. Cell cycle inhibitors were withheld in all patients, whereas the calcineurin inhibitor and corticosteroids were continued at the same dose, with an acceptable outcome.

A sensitive and specific antigen detection assay for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus

Since its emergence in 2012, more than 900 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have been reported with a fatality rate of more than 30%. However, no antigen detection assay for commercial use is available for diagnosis. In this study, the full-length nucleocapsid protein (NP) gene of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. A MERS-CoV NP capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using two MERS-CoV-NP-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) generated was developed. The ELISA was evaluated using 129 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) positive for various respiratory viruses and simulated positive NPAs by adding serial dilutions of MERS-CoV. Using a cutoff OD of 0.19, all 129 NPAs positive for respiratory viruses showed very low OD, with a specificity of 100%. For the two simulated MERS-CoV-positive NPAs with serial dilutions of live MERS-CoV, all samples with ≥10 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50))/0.1 mL showed positive results. For the 10 additional NPAs with 20 and 200 TCID(50)/0.1 mL of live MERS-CoV added, all were positive. A highly sensitive and specific MAbs-based antigen capture ELISA has been developed for MERS. This sensitive and specific antigen capture ELISA should be useful for detection of MERS-CoV in human and dromedaries and in field studies.

Should Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ever Be Used for the Management of Hypertension?

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are commonly used anti-hypertensive medications in a number of clinical settings. They are often used interchangeably, but we pose the provocative question as to whether they should be. We review the literature to evaluate for any differences in efficacy between the two classes in order to determine if the greater side effects associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are offset by any advantageous effects on outcomes to warrant their use over angiotensin receptor blockers. RECENT FINDINGS: In many clinical scenarios, the data supports similar efficacy between ACE inhibitors and ARBs, while in a minority of others, there are murky signals from previous trials that suggest ACE inhibitors may be better. However, when reviewing the literature in its entirety, and taking into account recently published pooled analysis and head to head trials, it is reasonable to conclude that ACE inhibitors and ARBs have similar efficacy. This is in contrast to data on adverse effects, which consistently favors the use of ARBs. SUMMARY: From the available data, it is reasonable to conclude that ACE inhibitors and ARBs have equal efficacy yet unequal adverse effects. It is in this context that we take the provocative stance that ACE inhibitors should not be used to treat hypertension.

Using Clinical Research Networks to Assess Severity of an Emerging Influenza Pandemic

BACKGROUND: Early clinical severity assessments during the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic (pH1N1) overestimated clinical severity due to selection bias and other factors. We retrospectively investigated how to use data from the International Network for Strategic Initiatives in Global HIV Trials, a global clinical influenza research network, to make more accurate case fatality ratio (CFR) estimates early in a future pandemic, an essential part of pandemic response. METHODS: We estimated the CFR of medically attended influenza (CFR(MA)) as the product of probability of hospitalization given confirmed outpatient influenza and the probability of death given hospitalization with confirmed influenza for the pandemic (2009–2011) and post-pandemic (2012–2015) periods. We used literature survey results on health-seeking behavior to convert that estimate to CFR among all infected persons (CFR(AR)). RESULTS: During the pandemic period, 5.0% (3.1%–6.9%) of 561 pH1N1-positive outpatients were hospitalized. Of 282 pH1N1-positive inpatients, 8.5% (5.7%–12.6%) died. CFR(MA) for pH1N1 was 0.4% (0.2%–0.6%) in the pandemic period 2009–2011 but declined 5-fold in young adults during the post-pandemic period compared to the level of seasonal influenza in the post-pandemic period 2012–2015. CFR for influenza-negative patients did not change over time. We estimated the 2009 pandemic CFR(AR) to be 0.025%, 16-fold lower than CFR(MA). CONCLUSIONS: Data from a clinical research network yielded accurate pandemic severity estimates, including increased severity among younger people. Going forward, clinical research networks with a global presence and standardized protocols would substantially aid rapid assessment of clinical severity. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT01056354 and NCT010561.

Anesthetic and surgical management of tracheostomy in a patient with COVID-19

Abstract The ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection causes severe respiratory dysfunction and has become an emergent issue for worldwide healthcare. Since COVID-19 spreads through contact and droplet infection routes, careful attention to infection control and surgical management is important to prevent cross-contamination of patients and medical staff. Tracheostomy is an effective method to treat severe respiratory dysfunction with prolonged respiratory management and should be performed as a high-risk procedure. Strict precaution and sufficient use of muscle relaxants are essential during tracheostomy to minimize cross-contamination among healthcare workers in the hospital. Here, we describe the anesthetic and surgical management of tracheostomy in a patient with COVID-19.

Lung Ultrasound in Children with COVID-19: Preliminary Findings

Abstract— Recent evidence indicates the usefulness of lung ultrasound (LUS) in detecting coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pneumonia. However, no data are available on the use of LUS in children with COVID-19 pneumonia. In this report, we describe LUS features of 10 consecutively admitted children with COVID-19 in two tertiary-level pediatric hospitals in Rome. LUS revealed signs of lung involvement during COVID-19 infection. In particular, vertical artifacts (70%), pleural irregularities (60%), areas of white lung (10%) and subpleural consolidations (10%) were the main findings in patients with COVID-19. No cases of pleural effusions were found. According to our experience, the routine use of LUS in the evaluation of children with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, when performed by clinicians with documented experience in LUS, was useful in diagnosing and monitoring pediatric COVID-19 pneumonia, reducing unnecessary radiation/sedation in children and exposure of health care workers to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Rethinking Essential Services in the Wake of the COVID-19 Health Crisis

During the COVID-19 global pandemic, Cook Children’s Health Care System needed a way to ensure that all employees had a reliable childcare option. This advocacy note details how Child Study Center, an applied behavior analysis facility in North Texas, transitioned into Camp Cook, a free-of-charge childcare facility that operates weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Closing the doors on our billable services allowed us to open them to the essential health care workers who were fighting on the front lines against COVID-19. Here we describe the redeployment of employees across 3 departments in an effort to ease the burden of childcare within our local community.

Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak on acute coronary syndrome admissions: four weeks to reverse the trend

Data whether the COVID-19 outbreak impacts the acute coronary syndromes (ACS) admissions and the time required to reverse the downward curve are scarce. We included all consecutive patients referred for an ACS who underwent PCI from February 17, 2020 to April 26, 2020 in a high-volume PCI coronary care unit. We compared the number of ACS patients in 2020 to the same period in 2018 and 2019. Predictors of adverse outcome in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients were recorded: symptom-onset-to-first medical contact (FMC), and FMC-to-sheath insertion times. During the studied period (calendar weeks 8–17, 2018–2020), 144 ACS patients were included. In 2020, we observed two distinct phases in the ACS admissions: a first significant fall, with a relative reduction of 73%, from the week of lockdown (week 12) to 3 weeks later and then an increase of ACS. Median symptom-onset-to-FMC time was significantly higher in 2020 than in the two previous years (600 min [298–632] versus 121 min [55–291], p < 0.001). Median FMC-to-sheath insertion did not differ significantly (93 min [81–131] in 2020 versus 90 min [67–137] in 2018–2019, p = 0.57). The main findings are (1) a pattern of a U-curve in ACS admissions, with a first decrease in ACS admissions and a return to “normality” 4 weeks after; (2) a significant increase in the total ischemic time exclusively due to an increase in the symptom-onset-to-first-medical-contact time.

Household Transmission of SARS-CoV-2, Zhuhai, China, 2020

BACKGROUND: To illustrate the extent of transmission, identify affecting risk factors and estimate epidemiological modeling parameters of SARS-CoV-2 in household setting. METHODS: We enrolled 35 confirmed index cases and their 148 household contacts, January 2020–February 2020, in Zhuhai, China. All participants were interviewed and asked to complete questionnaires. Household contacts were then prospectively followed active symptom monitoring through the 21-day period and nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs were collected at 3-7 days intervals. Epidemiological, demographic and clinical data (when available) were collected. RESULTS: Assuming that all these secondary cases were infected by their index cases, the second infection rate (SIR) in household context is 32.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 22.4%-44.4%), with 10.4% of secondary cases being asymptomatic. Multivariate analysis showed that household contacts with underlying medical conditions, a history of direct exposure to Wuhan and its surrounding areas, and shared vehicle with an index patient were associated with higher susceptibility. Household members without protective measures after illness onset of the index patient seem to increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The median incubation period and serial interval within household were estimated to be 4.3 days (95% CI; 3.4 to 5.3 days) and 5.1 days (95% CI; 4.3 to 6.2 days), respectively. CONCLUSION: Early isolation of patients with COVID-19 and prioritizing rapid contact investigation, followed by active symptom monitoring and periodic laboratory evaluation, should be initiated immediately after confirming patients to address the underlying determinants driving the continuing pandemic.

Environmental and non-infectious factors in the aetiology of pharyngitis (sore throat)

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review is to examine the causes, pathophysiology and experimental models of non-infectious pharyngitis (sore throat). INTRODUCTION: The causes of sore throat can be infectious (viruses, bacteria, and fungi) or non-infectious, although the relative proportion of each is not well documented. METHODS: A PubMed database search was performed for studies of non-infectious sore throat. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Non-infectious causes of sore throat include: physico-chemical factors, such as smoking, snoring, shouting, tracheal intubation, medications, or concomitant illness; and environmental factors including indoor and outdoor air pollutants, temperature and humidity, and hazardous or occupational irritants. The pathophysiology underlying non-infectious sore throat is largely uncharacterised, although neurogenic inflammation looks to be a promising candidate. It is likely that there will be individual disposition factors or the coincidence of more than one irritant with possible—up to now unknown—interactions between them. Therefore, experimental models with defined conditions and objective endpoints are needed. A new model using cold dry air to directly induce pharyngeal irritation in humans, with pharyngeal lavage to measure biomarkers, may provide a useful tool for the study of mechanisms and treatment of non-infectious sore throat.

Oral Manifestations in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19)

Martín Carreras‐Presas et al. (2020) reported a case in May in Oral Diseases that they suggested was the first case report describing of a COVID‐19 patient with oral manifestations including oral pain, desquamative gingivitis, ulcers and blisters. Galván Casas et al. (2020) provided a description in April in the British Journal of Dermatology of the cutaneous manifestations of COVID‐19 in an impressive 375 case series, and with that, they had documented for the first time the oral manifestations of the disease. The report includes an atlas of these manifestations as a downloadable supplement that includes apparently 150 different cases and among those, two cases with intra‐oral manifestations that vary from ulcers in the palatal mucosa, to localized erythema in the palate and the margins of gingiva.

Coronavirus envelope (E) protein remains at the site of assembly

Abstract Coronaviruses (CoVs) assemble at endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) membranes and egress from cells in cargo vesicles. Only a few molecules of the envelope (E) protein are assembled into virions. The role of E in morphogenesis is not fully understood. The cellular localization and dynamics of mouse hepatitis CoV A59 (MHV) E protein were investigated to further understanding of its role during infection. E protein localized in the ERGIC and Golgi with the amino and carboxy termini in the lumen and cytoplasm, respectively. E protein does not traffic to the cell surface. MHV was genetically engineered with a tetracysteine tag at the carboxy end of E. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) showed that E is mobile in ERGIC/Golgi membranes. Correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) confirmed the presence of E in Golgi cisternae. The results provide strong support that E proteins carry out their function(s) at the site of budding/assembly.

Molecular Mimicry, Microbial Infection, and Autoimmune Disease: Evolution of the Concept

Molecular mimicry is defined as similar structures shared by molecules from dissimilar genes or by their protein products. Either several linear amino acids or their conformational fit may be shared, even though their origins are separate. Hence, during a viral or microbe infection, if that organism shares cross-reactive epitopes for B or T cells with the host, then the response to the infecting agent will also attack the host, causing autoimmune disease. A variation on this theme is when a second, third, or repeated infection(s) shares cross-reactive B or T cell epitopes with the first (initiating) virus but not necessarily the host. In this instance, the secondary infectious agents increase the number of antiviral/antihost effector antibodies or T cells that potentiate or precipitate the autoimmune assault. The formation of this concept initially via study of monoclonal antibody or clone T cell cross-recognition in vitro through its evolution to in vivo animal models and to selected human diseases is explored in this mini-review.

Mechanisms of Host Receptor Adaptation by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from palm civets has twice evolved the capacity to infect humans by gaining binding affinity for human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Numerous mutations have been identified in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of different SARS-CoV strains isolated from humans or civets. Why these mutations were naturally selected or how SARS-CoV evolved to adapt to different host receptors has been poorly understood, presenting evolutionary and epidemic conundrums. In this study, we investigated the impact of these mutations on receptor recognition, an important determinant of SARS-CoV infection and pathogenesis. Using a combination of biochemical, functional, and crystallographic approaches, we elucidated the molecular and structural mechanisms of each of these naturally selected RBD mutations. These mutations either strengthen favorable interactions or reduce unfavorable interactions with two virus-binding hot spots on ACE2, and by doing so, they enhance viral interactions with either human (hACE2) or civet (cACE2) ACE2. Therefore, these mutations were viral adaptations to either hACE2 or cACE2. To corroborate the above analysis, we designed and characterized two optimized RBDs. The human-optimized RBD contains all of the hACE2-adapted residues (Phe-442, Phe-472, Asn-479, Asp-480, and Thr-487) and possesses exceptionally high affinity for hACE2 but relative low affinity for cACE2. The civet-optimized RBD contains all of the cACE2-adapted residues (Tyr-442, Pro-472, Arg-479, Gly-480, and Thr-487) and possesses exceptionally high affinity for cACE2 and also substantial affinity for hACE2. These results not only illustrate the detailed mechanisms of host receptor adaptation by SARS-CoV but also provide a molecular and structural basis for tracking future SARS-CoV evolution in animals.

COVID-19, an opportunity to reevaluate the correlation between long-term effects of anthropogenic pollutants on viral epidemic/pandemic events and prevalence

Occupational, residential, dietary and environmental exposures to mixtures of synthetic anthropogenic chemicals after World War II have a strong relationship with the increase of chronic diseases, health cost and environmental pollution. The link between environment and immunity is particularly intriguing as it is known that chemicals and drugs can cause immunotoxicity (e.g., allergies and autoimmune diseases). In this review, we emphasize the relationship between long-term exposure to xenobiotic mixtures and immune deficiency inherent to chronic diseases and epidemics/pandemics. We also address the immunotoxicologic risk of vulnerable groups, taking into account biochemical and biophysical properties of SARS-CoV-2 and its immunopathological implications. We particularly underline the common mechanisms by which xenobiotics and SARS-CoV-2 act at the cellular and molecular level. We discuss how long-term exposure to thousand chemicals in mixtures, mostly fossil fuel derivatives, exposure toparticle matters, metals, ultraviolet (UV)–B radiation, ionizing radiation and lifestyle contribute to immunodeficiency observed in the contemporary pandemic, such as COVID-19, and thus threaten global public health, human prosperity and achievements, and global economy. Finally, we propose metrics which are needed to address the diverse health effects of anthropogenic COVID-19 crisis at present and those required to prevent similar future pandemics.

Respiratory Tract Infections Due to Human Metapneumovirus in Immunocompromised Children

BACKGROUND: The clinical presentation and management of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infections in immunocompromised children is not well understood. METHODS: We performed a retrospective evaluation of pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed hMPV infections and underlying hematologic malignancy, solid tumors, solid organ transplant, rheumatologic disease, and/or receipt of chronic immunosuppressants. Data were analyzed using t tests and Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: Overall, 55 patients (median age: 5 years; range: 5 months–19 years) with hMPV infection documented between 2006 and 2010 were identified, including 24 (44%) with hematologic malignancy, 9 (16%) undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant, 9 (16%) with solid tumors, and 8 (15%) with solid organ transplants. Three (5%) presented with fever alone, 35 (64%) presented with upper respiratory tract infections, and 16 (29%) presented with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). Twelve (23%) patients required intensive care unit admission and/or supplemental oxygen ≥28% FiO(2). Those with severe disease were more likely to be neutropenic (P = .02), but otherwise did not differ by age (P = .27), hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient status (P = .19), or presence of lymphopenia (P = .09). Nine (16%) patients received treatment with ribavirin, intravenous immunoglobulin, or both. Three children (5%) died of hMPV pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Immunocompromised pediatric patients with hMPV infection have high rates of LRTI and mortality. The benefits of treatment with ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin in this patient population require further evaluation.

Occurrence, clinical involvement and zoonotic potential of endoparasites infecting Swiss pigs

Abstract In order to estimate the diversity, clinical involvement and zoonotic potential of parasites in pigs submitted for diagnosis to the PathoPig project of the Swiss Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office, faeces (n =125) from suckling piglets (n =39), weaners (n =60) and piglets beginning fattening (n =26) from 74 Swiss farms were examined by 3 coproscopical methods (i.e. sedimentation/zinc chloride-flotation; SAFC and Ziehl-Neelsen staining). Samples microscopically positive for Cryptosporidium were further tested by PCR/sequencing for species assessment. The most frequently detected parasite was Balantidium coli, a facultative pathogenic ciliate with zoonotic potential, in 5.1, 36.7 and 50.0% of suckling, weaners and fatteners and 43.2% of farms; however, no association with disease was observed. Isospora (syn. Cystoisospora) suis infections were detected in 13.3 and 11.1% of suckling piglets with and without diarrhoea, and in 10.0 and 13.3% of weaners and fatteners with diarrhoea, respectively, and were significant associated with emaciation. Cryptosporidium infections were detected in 10.3, 15.0 and 19.2% of sucklings, weaners and fatteners, respectively, and in 18.9% of the farms. Interestingly, two age-related species were identified: C. suis in younger piglets (2 to 6weeks) and C. scrofarum in older ones (6 to 17weeks). None of the pigs infected with C. scrofarum (n =8), but 3 of 4 piglets infected with C. suis (co-infection with I. suis in 2 cases) had diarrhoea. The zoonotic species C. parvum was not detected, nevertheless, sporadic cases of human infection with the porcine-adapted species have been reported. Ascaris suum, Trichuris suis and Strongylida were rarely detected (<4%) in all age categories.

Development of a one-run real-time PCR detection system for pathogens associated with porcine respiratory diseases

The etiology of Porcine respiratory disease complex is complicated by infections with multiple pathogens, and multiple infections increase the difficulty in identifying the causal pathogen. In this present study, we developed a detection system of microbes from porcine respiratory by using TaqMan real-time PCR (referred to as Dempo-PCR) to screen a broad range of pathogens associated with porcine respiratory diseases in a single run. We selected 17 porcine respiratory pathogens (Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Boldetella bronchiseptica, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella multocida toxin, Streptococcus suis, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Mycoplasma hyosynovie, porcine circovirus 2, pseudorabies virus, porcine cytomegalovirus, swine influenza A virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory virus US strain, EU strain, porcine respiratory coronavirus and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus) as detection targets and designed novel specific primer-probe sets for seven of them. In sensitivity test by using standard curves from synthesized DNA, all primer-probe sets showed high sensitivity. However, porcine reproductive and respiratory virus is known to have a high frequency of genetic mutations, and the primer and probe sequences will need to be checked at a considerable frequency when performing Dempo-PCR from field samples. A total of 30 lung samples from swine showing respiratory symptoms on six farms were tested by the Dempo-PCR to validate the assay’s clinical performance. As the results, 12 pathogens (5 virus and 7 bacteria) were detected and porcine reproductive and respiratory virus US strain, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Haemophilus parasuis, and porcine cytomegalovirus were detected at high frequency. These results suggest that Dempo-PCR assay can be applied as a screening system with wide detection targets.

SARS-CoV-2 and Cancer: are they really partners in crime ?

Abstract The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has overwhelmed health care systems in many countries. The clinical presentation of the SARS-CoV-2 varies between a subclinical or flu-like syndrome to that of severe pneumonia with multi-organ failure and death. Initial reports have suggested that cancer patients may have a higher susceptibility to get infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus but current evidence remains poor as it is biased by important confounders. Patients with ongoing or recent cancer treatment for advanced active disease, metastatic solid tumors and hematological malignancies are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 respiratory disease that requires hospitalization and have a poorer disease outcome compared to individuals without cancer. However it is not clear whether these are independent risk factors, or mainly driven by male gender, age, obesity, performance status, uncontrolled diabetes, cardiovascular disease and various other medical conditions. These often have a greater influence on the probability to die due to SARS-CoV-2 then cancer. Delayed diagnosis and suboptimal cancer management due to the pandemic results in disease upstaging and has considerable impact cancer on specific death rates. Surgery during the peak of the pandemic seems to increase mortality, but there is no convincing evidence that adjuvant systemic cancer therapy and radiotherapy are contraindicated, implicating that cancer treatment can be provided safely after individual risk/benefit assessment and some adaptive measures. Underlying immunosuppression, elevated cytokine levels, altered expression of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) and TMPRSS2, and a prothrombotic status may fuel the effects of a SARS-CoV-2 in some cancer patients, but have the potential to be used as biomarkers for severe disease and therapeutic targets. The rapidly expanding literature on COVID-19 should be interpreted with care as it is often hampered by methodological and statistical flaws.

Efficacy and Safety of Low Dose Recombinant Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator for the Treatment of Acute Pulmonary Thromboembolism A Randomized, Multicenter, Controlled Trial

Background Optimal dosing of the recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is important in treating pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of a 50 mg/2 h rt-PA regimen with a 100 mg/2 h rt-PA regimen in patients with acute PTE. Methods A prospective, randomized, multicenter trial was conducted in which 118 patients with acute PTE and either hemodynamic instability or massive pulmonary artery obstruction were randomly assigned to receive a treatment regiment of either rt-PA at 50 mg/2 h (n = 65) or 100 mg/2 h (n = 53). The efficacy was determined by observing the improvements of right ventricular dysfunctions (RVDs) on echocardiograms, lung perfusion defects on ventilation perfusion lung scans, and pulmonary artery obstructions on CT angiograms. The adverse events, including death, bleeding, and PTE recurrence, were also evaluated. Results Progressive improvements in RVDs, lung perfusion defects, and pulmonary artery obstructions were found to be similarly significant in both treatment groups. This is true for patients with either hemodynamic instability or massive pulmonary artery obstruction. Three (6%) patients in the rt-PA 100 mg/2 h group and one (2%) in the rt-PA 50 mg/2 h group died as the result of either PTE or bleeding. Importantly, the 50 mg/2 h rt-PA regimen resulted in less bleeding tendency than the 100 mg/2 h regimen (3% vs 10%), especially in patients with a body weight < 65 kg (14.8% vs 41.2%, P = .049). No fatal recurrent PTE was found in either group. Conclusions Compared with the 100 mg/2 h regimen, the 50 mg/2 h rt-PA regimen exhibits similar efficacy and perhaps better safety in patients with acute PTE. These findings support the notion that optimizing rt-PA dosing is worthwhile when treating patients with PTE. Trial registration clinicaltrials.gov; Identifier: NCT00781378

Glycosylator: a Python framework for the rapid modeling of glycans

BACKGROUND: Carbohydrates are a class of large and diverse biomolecules, ranging from a simple monosaccharide to large multi-branching glycan structures. The covalent linkage of a carbohydrate to the nitrogen atom of an asparagine, a process referred to as N-linked glycosylation, plays an important role in the physiology of many living organisms. Most software for glycan modeling on a personal desktop computer requires knowledge of molecular dynamics to interface with specialized programs such as CHARMM or AMBER. There are a number of popular web-based tools that are available for modeling glycans (e.g., GLYCAM-WEB (http://https://dev.glycam.org/gp/) or Glycosciences.db (http://www.glycosciences.de/)). However, these web-based tools are generally limited to a few canonical glycan conformations and do not allow the user to incorporate glycan modeling into their protein structure modeling workflow. RESULTS: Here, we present Glycosylator, a Python framework for the identification, modeling and modification of glycans in protein structure that can be used directly in a Python script through its application programming interface (API) or through its graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI provides a straightforward two-dimensional (2D) rendering of a glycoprotein that allows for a quick visual inspection of the glycosylation state of all the sequons on a protein structure. Modeled glycans can be further refined by a genetic algorithm for removing clashes and sampling alternative conformations. Glycosylator can also identify specific three-dimensional (3D) glycans on a protein structure using a library of predefined templates. CONCLUSIONS: Glycosylator was used to generate models of glycosylated protein without steric clashes. Since the molecular topology is based on the CHARMM force field, new complex sugar moieties can be generated without modifying the internals of the code. Glycosylator provides more functionality for analyzing and modeling glycans than any other available software or webserver at present. Glycosylator will be a valuable tool for the glycoinformatics and biomolecular modeling communities.

Exploring the influence of enforcing infection control directives on the risk of developing healthcare associated infections in the intensive care unit: A retrospective study

Summary Background Although strict adherence to infection control strategies is recognised as the simplest and most cost effective method to prevent the spread of healthcare associated infections (HAIs), measurement of the direct impact that such adherence may have on the risk of developing such infections has always been a challenge. Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare the risk of HAIs before and during the SARS outbreak. Such comparison is intended to provide a surrogate measure of the influence that strict enforcement of infection control strategies during the SARS outbreak may have had on the risk of HAIs. Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted on the medical records of 400 intensive care patients who were admitted to the ICU three months before and during the 2003 SARS outbreak. Results The rate of HAIs was higher in the pre-SARS period than the SARS period. Specifically, 61.7% of all reported infections were diagnosed in the pre-SARS period. The rate of HAIs in the pre-SARS period was 14.5% as opposed to 9% during the SARS period. Adjusted logistic regression analysis suggested that the odds of HAIs were 2.2 times higher in the pre-SARS period as compared to the SARS period (OR =2.2; 95%CI =1.08–4.49). Conclusion Our findings suggest that strict enforcement of infection control strategies may have a positive impact on the efforts to minimise the risk of HAIs. These findings carry a clinical significance that shall not be ignored with regard to our overall efforts to minimise the risk of developing HAIs in the ICU.

Biochemical and structural characterization of the interface mediating interaction between the influenza A virus non-structural protein-1 and a monoclonal antibody

We have previously shown that a non-structural protein 1 (NS1)-binding monoclonal antibody, termed as 2H6, can significantly reduce influenza A virus (IAV) replication when expressed intracellularly. In this study, we further showed that 2H6 binds stronger to the NS1 of H5N1 than A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) because of an amino acid difference at residue 48. A crystal structure of 2H6 fragment antigen-binding (Fab) has also been solved and docked onto the NS1 structure to reveal the contacts between specific residues at the interface of antibody-antigen complex. In one of the models, the predicted molecular contacts between residues in NS1 and 2H6-Fab correlate well with biochemical results. Taken together, residues N48 and T49 in H5N1 NS1 act cooperatively to maintain a strong interaction with mAb 2H6 by forming hydrogen bonds with residues found in the heavy chain of the antibody. Interestingly, the pandemic H1N1-2009 and the majority of seasonal H3N2 circulating in humans since 1968 has N48 in NS1, suggesting that mAb 2H6 could bind to most of the currently circulating seasonal influenza A virus strains. Consistent with the involvement of residue T49, which is well-conserved, in RNA binding, mAb 2H6 was also found to inhibit the interaction between NS1 and double-stranded RNA.

Pulse vaccination of an epidemic model with two parallel infectious stages and time delays

Abstract An epidemic model with two parallel infectious stages and time delays and pulse vaccination is proposed. We introduce four thresholds and further obtain the conditions that the disease will be extinct or not. Corollaries show that under condition that θ > max { θ ∗ 1 , θ ∗ 2 } the disease will fade out, and if θ < min { θ 1 ∗ , θ 2 ∗ } , the disease will be endemic. Our results indicate that a larger pulse vaccination rate will lead to the eradication of a disease. Furthermore, two thresholds ℜ ∗ 1 and ℜ ∗ 2 show that the diversity of the contagiousness affects the basic properties of these models. In addition, numerical results indicate that the probability for an infected individual to enter different infective compartments greatly affects two infective compartments.

Evidence-based support for the all-hazards approach to emergency preparedness

BACKGROUND: During the last decade there has been a need to respond and recover from various types of emergencies including mass casualty events (MCEs), mass toxicological/chemical events (MTEs), and biological events (pandemics and bio-terror agents). Effective emergency preparedness is more likely to be achieved if an all-hazards response plan is adopted. OBJECTIVES: To investigate if there is a relationship among hospitals' preparedness for various emergency scenarios, and whether components of one emergency scenario correlate with preparedness for other emergency scenarios. METHODS: Emergency preparedness levels of all acute-care hospitals for MCEs, MTEs, and biological events were evaluated, utilizing a structured evaluation tool based on measurable parameters. Evaluations were made by professional experts in two phases: evaluation of standard operating procedures (SOPs) followed by a site visit. Relationships among total preparedness and different components' scores for various types of emergencies were analyzed. RESULTS: Significant relationships were found among preparedness for different emergencies. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for biological events correlated with preparedness for all investigated emergency scenarios. Strong correlations were found between training and drills with preparedness for all investigated emergency scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Fundamental critical building blocks such as SOPs, training, and drill programs improve preparedness for different emergencies including MCEs, MTEs, and biological events, more than other building blocks, such as equipment or knowledge of personnel. SOPs are especially important in unfamiliar emergency scenarios. The findings support the adoption of an all-hazards approach to emergency preparedness.

Comparing Luminex NxTAG‐Respiratory Pathogen Panel and RespiFinder‐22 for multiplex detection of respiratory pathogens

Respiratory tract infection (RTI) involves a variety of viruses and bacteria, which can be conveniently detected by multiplex nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT). To compare the novel Luminex‐based NxTAG‐Respiratory Pathogen Panel (NxTAG‐RPP) with the routine multiplex‐ligation‐NAT based RespiFinder‐22® (RF‐22), 282 respiratory specimens including nasopharyngeal swabs (71%), broncho‐alveolar lavage (27%), throat swabs, tracheal secretions, and sputum (2%) from 116 children and 155 adults were extracted using a Corbett CAS1200 (Qiagen), and analyzed in parallel by the routine RF‐22 and NxTAG‐RPP. Concordant results were obtained in 263 (93.3%) cases consisting of concordant positives in 167 (59.2%) and concordant negatives in 96 (34%). Results were discordant in 19 (6.7%) consisting of 15 positive:negative, and 4 negative:positive results by NxTAG‐RPP versus RF‐22, respectively. Co‐infections were observed in 10.3% with NxTAG‐RPP and in 5.9% with RF‐22. Most additional viral pathogens identified by the NxTAG‐RPP involved dual infections with rhinovirus and RSV. Discordant samples were mainly due to low genome signals of C(t) less than 36, when retested by QNAT suggesting a higher sensitivity of the NxTAG‐RPP, also when detecting multiple infections. Hands‐on time after extraction for 24 and 96 samples was 0.25 and <0.5 hr for the NxTAG‐RPP, and 2 and 4 hr for the RF‐22, respectively. The median turn‐around time was 6 hr (range 5–7 hr) for NxTAG‐RPP and 12 hr (range 8–16 hr) for RF‐22. The NxTAG‐RPP showed comparable detection rates for most respiratory pathogens, while hands‐on and turn‐around time were considerably shorter. The clinical significance of detecting multiple viruses needs further clinical evaluation. J. Med. Virol. 88:1319–1324, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Behaviors, movements, and transmission of droplet-mediated respiratory diseases during transcontinental airline flights

With over 3 billion airline passengers annually, the inflight transmission of infectious diseases is an important global health concern. Over a dozen cases of inflight transmission of serious infections have been documented, and air travel can serve as a conduit for the rapid spread of newly emerging infections and pandemics. Despite sensational media stories and anecdotes, the risks of transmission of respiratory viruses in an airplane cabin are unknown. Movements of passengers and crew may facilitate disease transmission. On 10 transcontinental US flights, we chronicled behaviors and movements of individuals in the economy cabin on single-aisle aircraft. We simulated transmission during flight based on these data. Our results indicate there is low probability of direct transmission to passengers not seated in close proximity to an infectious passenger. This data-driven, dynamic network transmission model of droplet-mediated respiratory disease is unique. To measure the true pathogen burden, our team collected 229 environmental samples during the flights. Although eight flights were during Influenza season, all qPCR assays for 18 common respiratory viruses were negative.

Plants as Factories for Human Pharmaceuticals: Applications and Challenges

Plant molecular farming (PMF), defined as the practice of using plants to produce human therapeutic proteins, has received worldwide interest. PMF has grown and advanced considerably over the past two decades. A number of therapeutic proteins have been produced in plants, some of which have been through pre-clinical or clinical trials and are close to commercialization. Plants have the potential to mass-produce pharmaceutical products with less cost than traditional methods. Tobacco-derived antibodies have been tested and used to combat the Ebola outbreak in Africa. Genetically engineered immunoadhesin (DPP4-Fc) produced in green plants has been shown to be able to bind to MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), preventing the virus from infecting lung cells. Biosafety concerns (such as pollen contamination and immunogenicity of plant-specific glycans) and costly downstream extraction and purification requirements, however, have hampered PMF production from moving from the laboratory to industrial application. In this review, the challenges and opportunities of PMF are discussed. Topics addressed include; transformation and expression systems, plant bioreactors, safety concerns, and various opportunities to produce topical applications and health supplements.

Monitoring Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) Infections in India by Cluster Analysis

It is a great challenge of identification as well as formation of groups of infectious disease data set. Data mining, a process of uncovering silent characteristics of big data is one of such techniques which have nowadays become more popular for treating massive volume of infectious disease data set. In the current study, we apply cluster analysis, one of the data mining techniques to classify real groups of infectious disease “novel corona virus disease (COVID-19)” data set of different states and union territories (UTs) in India according to their high similarity to each other. The results obtained permit us to have a sense of clusters of affected Indian states and UTs. The main objective of clustering in this study is to optimize monitoring techniques in affected states and UTs in India which will be very valuable to the government, doctors, the police and others involved in understanding seriousness of the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) to improve government policies, decisions, medical facilities (ventilators, testing kits, masks etc.), treatment etc. to reduce number of infected and deceased persons.

The short-term impact of COVID-19 pandemic on spine surgeons: a cross-sectional global study

PURPOSE: The outbreak of COVID-19 erupted in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. In a few weeks, it progressed rapidly into a global pandemic which resulted in an overwhelming burden on health care systems, medical resources and staff. Spine surgeons as health care providers are no exception. In this study, we try to highlight the impact of the crisis on spine surgeons in terms of knowledge, attitude, practice and socioeconomic burden. METHODS: This was global, multicentric cross-sectional study on 781 spine surgeons that utilized an Internet-based validated questionnaire to evaluate knowledge about COVID-19, availability of personal protective equipment, future perceptions, effect of this crisis on practice and psychological distress. Univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the predictors for the degree of COVID-19 effect on practice. RESULTS: Overall, 20.2%, 52% and 27.8% of the participants were affected minimally, intermediately and hugely by COVID-19, respectively. Older ages (β = 0.33, 95% CI 0.11–0.56), orthopedic spine surgeons (β = 0.30, 95% CI 0.01–0.61) and those who work in the private sector (β = 0.05, 95% CI 0.19–0.61) were the most affected by COVID-19. Those who work in university hospitals (β = − 0.36, 95% CI 0.00 to − 0.71) were affected the least. The availability of N95 masks (47%) and disposable eye protectors or face shields (39.4%) was significantly associated with lower psychological stress (p = 0.01). Only 6.9%, 3.7% and 5% had mild, moderate and severe mental distress, respectively. CONCLUSION: While it is important to recognize the short-term impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the practice of spine surgery, predicting where we will be standing in 6–12 months remains difficult and unknown. The COVID-19 crisis will probably have an unexpected long-term impact on lives and economies.

Association of Toll-like receptor 2-positive monocytes with coronary artery lesions and treatment nonresponse in Kawasaki disease

PURPOSE: Activation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) present on circulating monocytes in patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) can lead to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and interleukin-10 (IL-10). We aimed to determine the association of the frequency of circulating TLR2+/CD14+ monocytes (FTLR2%) with the outcomes of KD, as well as to compare FTLR2% to the usefulness of sIL-10. METHODS: The FTLR2% in patients with KD was measured by flow cytometry. Serum levels of IL-10 (sIL-10) were determined in 31 patients with KD before the initial treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and in 21 febrile controls by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients were classified as having coronary artery lesions (CALs) based on the maximal internal diameters of the proximal right coronary artery and proximal left anterior descending coronary artery one month after the initial diagnosis. RESULTS: We found that FTLR2% greater than 92.62% predicted CALs with 80% sensitivity and 68.4% specificity, whereas FTLR2% more than 94.61% predicted IVIG resistance with 66.7% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity. Moreover, sIL-10 more than 15.52 pg/mL predicted CALs and IVIG resistance with 40% and 66.7% sensitivity, respectively, and 73.7% and 76.2% specificity, respectively. CONCLUSION: We showed that measuring FTLR2% before the initial treatment could be useful in predicting CAL development with better sensitivity than sIL-10 and with results comparable to sIL-10 results for the prediction of IVIG resistance in patients with KD. However, further studies are necessary to validate FTLR2% as a marker of prognosis and severity of KD.

The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: Its evolution and transmission into humans causing global COVID-19 pandemic

A novel coronavirus strain 2019-nCoV has caused a rapid global pandemic-COVID-19. Scientists have taken onto the task of characterizing this new virus and understanding how this virus has transmitted to humans. All preliminary studies have found some striking similarities between this new virus and the SARS-CoV that caused a similar kind of epidemic in 2002–2003. Through bioinformatics tools, a great deal of information has been gathered about the origin, evolution and zoonosis of this virus. We, in this review, report the symptoms, mode of transmission and available and putative treatments to tackle 2019-nCoV infections. We also comprehensively summarize all the information so far made available regarding the genome, evolution and zoonosis of this virus.

Immunization with SARS Coronavirus Vaccines Leads to Pulmonary Immunopathology on Challenge with the SARS Virus

BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in China in 2002 and spread to other countries before brought under control. Because of a concern for reemergence or a deliberate release of the SARS coronavirus, vaccine development was initiated. Evaluations of an inactivated whole virus vaccine in ferrets and nonhuman primates and a virus-like-particle vaccine in mice induced protection against infection but challenged animals exhibited an immunopathologic-type lung disease. DESIGN: Four candidate vaccines for humans with or without alum adjuvant were evaluated in a mouse model of SARS, a VLP vaccine, the vaccine given to ferrets and NHP, another whole virus vaccine and an rDNA-produced S protein. Balb/c or C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated IM on day 0 and 28 and sacrificed for serum antibody measurements or challenged with live virus on day 56. On day 58, challenged mice were sacrificed and lungs obtained for virus and histopathology. RESULTS: All vaccines induced serum neutralizing antibody with increasing dosages and/or alum significantly increasing responses. Significant reductions of SARS-CoV two days after challenge was seen for all vaccines and prior live SARS-CoV. All mice exhibited histopathologic changes in lungs two days after challenge including all animals vaccinated (Balb/C and C57BL/6) or given live virus, influenza vaccine, or PBS suggesting infection occurred in all. Histopathology seen in animals given one of the SARS-CoV vaccines was uniformly a Th2-type immunopathology with prominent eosinophil infiltration, confirmed with special eosinophil stains. The pathologic changes seen in all control groups lacked the eosinophil prominence. CONCLUSIONS: These SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with SARS-CoV. However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of Th2-type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components was induced. Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated.

Synthesis and in vitro cytostatic activity of new β-d-arabino furan[1′,2′:4,5]oxazolo- and arabino-pyrimidinone derivatives

A series of nucleoside derivatives was obtained via heteroatom annulation of the amino oxazoline of d-(−)-arabinose. Unequivocal proofs for the stereostructure of some new arabinosyl pyrimidinone derivatives were obtained by X-ray structure analysis. These newly synthesized compounds were then evaluated for their cytostatic activity against murine leukemia (L1210), and human T-lymphocytes (Molt 4/C8 and CEM). Of all the compounds in the series, the protected silylated tricyclic fused pyrimidinone 10 showed the most significant antitumor activity against murine leukemia L1210 (IC(50) = 6 μM), and human T-lymphocytes cells Molt 4/C8 (IC(50) = 7.9 μM) and CEM/0 cell lines (IC(50) = 7.5 μM). None of the compounds exhibited significant antiviral inhibitory activities.

Nasopharyngeal bacterial load as a marker for rapid and easy diagnosis of invasive pneumococcal disease in children from Mozambique

BACKGROUND: Current diagnostic methods for detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae in children with suspected invasive pneumococcal disease have limitations of accuracy, timeliness, and patient convenience. This study aimed to determine the performance of pneumococcal load quantified with a real-time polymerase-chain reaction in nasopharyngeal samples to diagnose invasive pneumococcal disease in children. METHODS: Matched case-control study of patients <5 years of age with invasive pneumococcal disease admitted to the Manhiça District Hospital (Mozambique) and asymptomatic controls recruited in different periods between 2006 and 2014. Cases were confirmed by a positive bacterial culture for S. pneumoniae in blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from cases and controls and pneumococcal density was quantified by lytA real-time polymerase-chain reaction. RESULTS: Thirty cases (median age 12.8 months) and sixty controls (median age 11.7 months) were enrolled and 70% of them were male. Nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage was high in both groups: 28/30 (93.3%) for cases vs. 53/60 (88.3%) for controls (p = 0.71). Mean nasopharyngeal pneumococcal load was identified as a marker for invasive pneumococcal disease (7.0 log(10) copies/mL in cases vs. 5.8 log(10) copies/mL in controls, p<0.001) and showed good discriminatory power (AUC-ROC: 82.1%, 95% CI 72.5%-91.8%). A colonization density of 6.5 log(10) copies/mL was determined as the optimal cut-off value to distinguish cases from controls (sensitivity 75.0%, specificity 73.6%). CONCLUSION: Use of non-invasive nasopharyngeal aspirates coupled with rapid and accurate quantification of pneumococcal load by real-time polymerase chain reaction has the potential to become a useful surrogate marker for early diagnosis of invasive pneumococcal disease in children.

Supporting people with diabetes during a pandemic

In this issue, Joensen and colleagues present the first data we have seen on the impact and experience of diabetes through the lens of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research was completed in Denmark in March 2020, in the context of a marked shutdown of economic and social activities across the country, but without the devastating death tolls experienced by other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. There are several notable findings, which have global relevance, and we should take the time to reflect on these for our own localized contexts.

Severe COVID-19: A Review of Recent Progress With a Look Toward the Future

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute infectious disease caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, the World Health Organization has confirmed that COVID-19 is a global infectious disease pandemic. This is the third acute infectious disease caused by coronavirus infection in this century, after sudden acute respirator syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome. The damage mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear. It is possible that protein S binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors and invades alveolar epithelial cells, causing direct toxic effects and an excessive immune response. This stimulates a systemic inflammatory response, thus forming a cytokine storm, which leads to lung tissue injury. In severe cases, the disease can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Patients with severe COVID-19 have a relatively high mortality rate. Currently, there are no specific antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Most patients need to be admitted to the intensive care unit for intensive monitoring and supportive organ function treatments. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment methods of severe COVID-19 and puts forward some tentative ideas, aiming to provide some guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of severe COVID-19.

Effects of feeding polyclonal antibody preparations on ruminal bacterial populations and ruminal pH of steers fed high-grain diets

Three experiments with factorial arrangements of treatments were designed to test the efficacy of avian-derived polyclonal antibody preparations (PAP) against Streptococcus bovis (PAP-Sb) or Fusobacterium necrophorum (PAP-Fn) in reducing ruminal counts of target bacteria in beef steers supplemented or not with feed additives (300 mg of monensin/d and 90 mg of tylosin/d; MT). Feeding increasing doses of PAP-Sb in Exp. 1 or a single dose in Exp. 2 reduced S. bovis counts in a cubic fashion (P = 0.014). In Exp. 1 and 2, inclusion of MT in the diet had no effect (P > 0.05) on ruminal S. bovis counts. In Exp. 2, ruminal pH was increased (P < 0.05) by feeding PAP-Sb, MT, and PAP-Sb plus MT. Ruminal F. necrophorum counts were reduced by feeding PAP-Fn (P = 0.002) and MT (P < 0.001). Reduction in ruminal F. necrophorum counts was greater (P = 0.008) when feeding MT alone than when feeding PAP-Fn and MT together. In Exp. 3, ruminal S. bovis counts were not affected (P = 0.64) by PAP-Fn. Ruminal pH was not affected (P = 0.61) by feeding PAP-Fn, and the total anaerobic bacterial count was not affected (P > 0.05) by either PAP-Sb or PAP-Fn in Exp. 1 or Exp. 3. In conclusion, PAP of avian origin and against S. bovis or F. necrophorum were effective in reducing target ruminal bacterial populations. These PAP could be effective in preventing the deleterious effects associated with these bacteria, and possibly in enhancing animal performance.

ApoD Mediates Binding of HDL to LDL and to Growing T24 Carcinoma

Apolipoprotein (Apo) D is an important protein produced in many parts of the body. It is necessary for the development and repair of the brain and protection from oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which apoD interacts with lipoproteins in human plasma. By using detergent-free ELISA, we show that immobilized monoclonal antibodies against apoD very efficiently bind to low density lipoprotein (LDL) from plasma; this binding is as equally efficient as binding to an anti-apoB monoclonal antibody. Adding detergent to the plasma inhibited the binding, suggesting that the binding is dependent on the presence of intact lipoprotein particles. Reversing the system by using immobilized anti-apoB revealed that the affinity of apoD for LDL is rather low, suggesting that multiple bindings are needed for a durable connection. Biosensor experiments using purified lipoproteins also showed that purified apoD and high density lipoprotein 3 (HDL3), a lipoprotein fraction rich in apoD, were both able to bind LDL very efficiently, indicating that the HDL3-LDL interaction may be a physiological consequence of the affinity of apoD for LDL. Furthermore, we found that apoD increases the binding of HDL to actively growing T24 bladder carcinoma cells but not to quiescent, contact-inhibited, confluent T24 cells. This result is especially intriguing given that the T24 supernatant only contained detectable levels of apoD after growth inhibition, raising the possibility that alternating the expression of apoD and a putative apoD-receptor could give direction to the flow of lipids. In the current paper, we conclude that apoD mediates binding of HDL to LDL and to growing T24 carcinomas, thereby highlighting the importance of apoD in lipid metabolism.

Lyssavirus surveillance in bats of southern China’s Guangxi Province

Although rabies virus is widely distributed in the world, and has been the subject of extensive investigations with the objective of its ultimate prevention, control, and management, there is much less knowledge of the characteristics, distribution, and infectivity of other lyssaviruses. Since bats are known animal vectors for all but one of the known lyssavirus genotypes, we have performed an extensive survey of bats in the Guangxi Province to provide information on lyssavirus distribution in southern China. The lyssavirus nucleoprotein gene was detected in brains of 2.86 % of 2,969 bats. Nucleotide sequence homologies among isolates were 86.9–99.6 %, but only 70.0–85.0 % for lyssaviruses in GenBank. These infected bats were detected from a wide area, essentially forming a band running from the south-west to the north-east of Guangxi, and it appears that infection by new lyssaviruses is widespread in this region.

Laboratory Tests for Diagnosis of Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases

The panel of laboratory tests available for diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases in dogs and cats is wide, and, recently, several new tests have been developed. This article will focus on advances in laboratory tests that are available for the general practitioner for diagnosis of GI diseases. Laboratory tests for diagnosis of gastric and intestinal infectious diseases include fecal parasite screening tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for parvoviral enteritis, and some specific bacterial tests like fluorescent in situ hybridization for identification of specific bacteria attached to the intestinal epithelial cells. Serum concentrations of folate and cobalamin are markers of intestinal absorption, but are also changed in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Hypocobalaminemia is common in GI and pancreatic disease. Decreased serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity is a very sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in dogs and cats. Serum pancreatic lipase is currently the most sensitive and specific test to identify pancreatic cell damage and acute pancreatitis. However, serum canine pancreas-specific lipase is less sensitive in canine chronic pancreatitis. Increased serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity is also specific for pancreatic damage but is less sensitive. It is very likely that further studies will help to better specify the role of these new tests in the diagnosis of canine and feline pancreatic diseases.

Interactions of Pathogens with the Host

Abstract Infection occurs when a microbe enters a normally nonsterile tissue and may cause an infectious disease with signs and symptoms or a subclinical infection. Infections that are not cleared by the host are characterized as persistent. The agent in nonreplicating or latent infection may begin to grow again or to reactivate. Growth of a microorganism such as normal bacterial flora on a normally nonsterile body surface such as the colonic mucosa in the absence of disease is called colonization. Some infectious agents known as pathogens routinely cause disease; others known as opportunistic cause disease only in persons with altered host defenses, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The location where a pathogen normally resides is the reservoir, such as naturally infected animals. The mechanism by which the pathogen moves from the reservoir into the patient is known as transmission such as by drinking contaminated water. The portals of entry are mucosal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and cutaneous. A pathogen may replicate at the portal of entry and cause disease by secreting a toxin or enter the body and spread via the lymphatic or blood vessels, nerves, urinary tract, respiratory tract, cerebrospinal fluid, over mesothelial surfaces, or to the fetus transplacentally. Many infectious agents target a particular organ where they replicate and cause damage, for example, hepatitis, myocarditis, and meningoencephalitis.

Ubiquitin in the activation and attenuation of innate antiviral immunity

Viral infection activates danger signals that are transmitted via the retinoic acid–inducible gene 1–like receptor (RLR), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR), and Toll-like receptor (TLR) protein signaling cascades. This places host cells in an antiviral posture by up-regulating antiviral cytokines including type-I interferon (IFN-I). Ubiquitin modifications and cross-talk between proteins within these signaling cascades potentiate IFN-I expression, and inversely, a growing number of viruses are found to weaponize the ubiquitin modification system to suppress IFN-I. Here we review how host- and virus-directed ubiquitin modification of proteins in the RLR, NLR, and TLR antiviral signaling cascades modulate IFN-I expression.

Role of pharmacist during the COVID-19 pandemic: A scoping review

BACKGROUND: Since the start of the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in December 2019, pharmacists worldwide are playing a key role adopting innovative strategies to minimize the adverse impact of the pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To identify and describe core services provided by the pharmacist during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A literature search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and LILACS for studies published between December 1st, 2019 and May 20th, 2020 without language restriction. Studies that reported services provided by pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Two independent authors performed study selection and data extraction with a consensus process. The pharmacist's intervention identified in the included studies were described based on key domains in the DEPICT v.2. RESULTS: A total of 1189 records were identified, of which 11 studies fully met the eligibility criteria. Most of them were conducted in the United States of America (n = 4) and China (n = 4). The most common type of publication were letters (n = 4) describing the workplace of the pharmacist in hospitals (n = 8). These findings showed the different roles of pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as disease prevention and infection control, adequate storage and drug supply, patient care and support for healthcare professionals. Pharmacists' interventions were mostly conducted for healthcare professionals and patients (n = 7), through one-to-one contact (n = 11), telephone (n = 6) or video conference (n = 5). The pharmacists' main responsibility was to provide drug information for healthcare professionals (n = 7) as well as patient counseling (n = 8). CONCLUSIONS: A reasonable number of studies that described the role of the pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic were found. All studies reported actions taken by pharmacists, although without providing a satisfactory description. Thus, future research with more detailed description as well as an evaluation of the impact of pharmacist intervention is needed in order to guide future actions in this and/or other pandemic.

Etiology of respiratory tract infections in the community and clinic in Ilorin, Nigeria

OBJECTIVE: Recognizing increasing interest in community disease surveillance globally, the goal of this study was to investigate whether respiratory viruses circulating in the community may be represented through clinical (hospital) surveillance in Nigeria. RESULTS: Children were selected via convenience sampling from communities and a tertiary care center (n = 91) during spring 2017 in Ilorin, Nigeria. Nasal swabs were collected and tested using polymerase chain reaction. The majority (79.1%) of subjects were under 6 years old, of whom 46 were infected (63.9%). A total of 33 of the 91 subjects had one or more respiratory tract virus; there were 10 cases of triple infection and 5 of quadruple. Parainfluenza virus 4, respiratory syncytial virus B and enterovirus were the most common viruses in the clinical sample; present in 93.8% (15/16) of clinical subjects, and 6.7% (5/75) of community subjects (significant difference, p < 0.001). Coronavirus OC43 was the most common virus detected in community members (13.3%, 10/75). A different strain, Coronavirus OC 229 E/NL63 was detected among subjects from the clinic (2/16) and not detected in the community. This pilot study provides evidence that data from the community can potentially represent different information than that sourced clinically, suggesting the need for community surveillance to enhance public health efforts and scientific understanding of respiratory infections.

Infectious Disease Management and Control with Povidone Iodine

With reports of vancomycin-resistant enterococci recently emerging in hospital settings, renewed focus is turning to the importance of multifaceted infection prevention efforts. Careful compliance with established hygiene practices by healthcare workers together with effective antiseptic options is essential for the protection of patients from infectious agents. For over 60 years, povidone iodine (PVP-I) formulations have been shown to limit the impact and spread of infectious diseases with potent antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal effects. In addition to a lack of reported resistance, the benefits of PVP-I include an excellent safety profile and a broad spectrum of effect due to its multimodal action. Studies have shown that hand washing with PVP-I-based antiseptics is effective for the decontamination of skin, while PVP-I mouthwashes and gargles significantly reduce viral load in the oral cavity and the oropharynx. The importance of PVP-I has been emphasised by its inclusion in the World Health Organization’s list of essential medicines, and high potency for virucidal activity has been observed against viruses of significant global concern, including hepatitis A and influenza, as well as the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome and Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses. Together with its diverse applications in antimicrobial control, broad accessibility across the globe, and outstanding safety and tolerability profile, PVP-I offers an affordable, potent, and widely available antiseptic option.

Respiratory viruses detected in Mexican children younger than 5 years old with community-acquired pneumonia: a national multicenter study

Abstract Background Acute respiratory infections are the leading cause of mortality in children worldwide, especially in developing countries. Pneumonia accounts for 16% of all deaths of children under 5 years of age and was the cause of death of 935000 children in 2015. Despite its frequency and severity, information regarding its etiology is limited. The aim of this study was to identify respiratory viruses associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children younger than 5 years old. Methods One thousand four hundred and four children younger than 5 years of age with a clinical and/or radiological diagnosis of CAP in 11 hospitals in Mexico were included. Nasal washes were collected, placed in viral medium, and frozen at −70°C until processing. The first 832 samples were processed using the multiplex Bio‐Plex/Luminex system and the remaining 572 samples using the Anyplex multiplex RT-PCR. Clinical data regarding diagnosis, clinical signs and symptoms, radiographic pattern, and risk factors were obtained and recorded. Results Of the samples tested, 81.6% were positive for viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus (types A and B) was found in 23.7%, human enterovirus/rhinovirus in 16.6%, metapneumovirus in 5.7%, parainfluenza virus (types 1–4) in 5.5%, influenza virus (types A and B) in 3.6%, adenovirus in 2.2%, coronavirus (NL63, OC43, 229E, and HKU1) in 2.2%, and bocavirus in 0.4%. Co-infection with two or more viruses was present in 22.1%; 18.4% of the samples were negative. Using biomass for cooking, daycare attendance, absence of breastfeeding, and co-infections were found to be statistically significant risk factors for the presence of severe pneumonia. Conclusions Respiratory syncytial virus (types A and B), human enterovirus/rhinovirus, and metapneumovirus were the respiratory viruses identified most frequently in children younger than 5 years old with CAP. Co-infection was present in an important proportion of the children.

Human Parvovirus 4: A harmless bystander or a pathogen of severe acute respiratory illness

Abstract Introduction Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, caused by a large number of viral and bacterial agents. PARV4 is a recently identified virus detected in human blood and variety of tissues, but its disease association with SARI could not be established. Objective In the present case control study, we aim to investigate the association of PARV4 with SARI. Methods The Nasal and Throat swab (NS/TS) samples of 241 cases and 146 healthy controls were tested for most common respiratory viruses and PARV4 by real-time PCR. Results PARV4 was detected in 64(26.55%) SARI cases and only one healthy control (0.68%). PARV4 was the most common viral agent detected in SARI cases. A strong association of PARV4 is seen with severe respiratory illness. Conclusion Detection of PARV4 in a significantly higher number of SARI cases, in comparison with controls, suggests association of PARV4 with SARI. PARV4 genotype 2 is the only circulating strain detected in our study.

Cytokine storm in COVID-19: pathogenesis and overview of anti-inflammatory agents used in treatment

COVID-19 infection has a heterogenous disease course; it may be asymptomatic or causes only mild symptoms in the majority of the cases, while immunologic complications such as macrophage activation syndrome also known as secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, resulting in cytokine storm syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome, may also occur in some patients. According to current literature, impairment of SARS-CoV-2 clearance due to genetic and viral features, lower levels of interferons, increased neutrophil extracellular traps, and increased pyroptosis and probable other unknown mechanisms create a background for severe disease course complicated by macrophage activation syndrome and cytokine storm. Various genetic mutations may also constitute a risk factor for severe disease course and occurrence of cytokine storm in COVID-19. Once, immunologic complications like cytokine storm occur, anti-viral treatment alone is not enough and should be combined with appropriate anti-inflammatory treatment. Anti-rheumatic drugs, which are tried for managing immunologic complications of COVID-19 infection, will also be discussed including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, JAK inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, IL-1 inhibitors, anti-TNF-α agents, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and colchicine. Early recognition and appropriate treatment of immunologic complications will decrease the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 infection, which requires the collaboration of infectious disease, lung, and intensive care unit specialists with other experts such as immunologists, rheumatologists, and hematologists.

Insilico Alpha-Helical Structural Recognition of Temporin Antimicrobial Peptides and Its Interactions with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus

Many antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have multiple antimicrobial immunity effects. One such class of peptides is temporins. Temporins are the smallest (AMPs) found in nature and are highly active against gram-positive bacteria. Nowadays, there was a rapid increase in the availability of the 3D structure of proteins in PDB (protein data bank). The conserved residues and 3D structural conformations of temporins (AMPs) were still unknown. The present study explores the sequence analysis, alpha-helical structural conformations of temporins. The sequence of temporins was deracinated from APD3 database, the three-dimensional structure was constructed by homology modeling studies. The sequence analysis results show that the conserved residues among the peptide sequences, the maximum of the sequences are 70% alike to each other. The secondary structure prediction results revealed that 99% of temporin (AMPs) exhibited in alpha-helical form. The 3D structure speculated using RAMPAGE exposes the alpha-helical conformation in all temporins (AMPs). The phylogenetic analysis reveals the evolutionary relationships of temporins (AMPs), which are branched into seven clusters. As a result, we identified a list of potential temporin AMPs which docked to the antiviral protein (MERS-CoV), it shows good protein-peptide binding. This computational approach may serve as a good model for the rationale design of temporin based antibiotics.

Portable sequencer in the fight against infectious disease

Infectious disease is still a major threat in the world today. Five decades ago, it was considered soon to be eradicated, but the adaptation of pathogens to environmental pressure, such as antimicrobials, encouraged the emergence and reemergence of infectious disease. The fight with infectious disease starts with prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Diagnosis can be upheld by observing the cause of disease under the microscope or detecting the presence of nucleic acid and proteins of the pathogens. The molecular techniques span from classical polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to sequencing the nucleic acid composition. Here, we are reviewing the works have been undertaken to utilize a portable sequencer, MinION, in various aspects of infectious disease management.

The Association Between Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers and the Number of Covid-19 Confirmed Cases and Deaths in the United States: Geospatial Study

Background: The novel coronavirus SARS-Cov2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as an entry point to the cell. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a risk factor for the novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) with poor outcomes. We hypothesized that the rate of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) use is associated with the rate of Covid-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Methods: We conducted a geospatial study using publicly available county-level data. The Medicare ACEIs and ARBs prescription rate was exposure. The Covid-19 confirmed case and death rates were outcomes. Spatial autoregression models were adjusted for the percentage of Black residents, children, residents with at least some college degree, median household income, air quality index, CVD hospitalization rate in Medicare beneficiaries, and CVD death rate in a total county population. Results: The ACEI use had no effect on Covid-19 confirmed case rate. An average ACEIs use (compared to no-use) was associated with a higher Covid-19 death rate by 1.1 (95%CI 0.4-1.8)%. If the use of ACEIs increases by 0.5% for all counties, the Covid-19 death rate will drop by 0.4% to 0.7(95%CI 0.3-1.1)%; P<0.0001. An average ARBs use (compared to no-use) was associated with a higher Covid-19 confirmed case rate (by 4.2; 95%CI 4.1-4.3 %) and death rate (by 1.1; 95%CI 0.7-1.5 %). Each percent increase in ARBs use was associated with an increase in confirmed case rate by 0.2(0.03-0.4)% and death rate by 0.14(0.08-0.21)%. Conclusions: ARBs, but not ACEIs use rate, is associated with Covid-19 confirmed case rate.

A descriptive study of on-farm biosecurity and management practices during the incursion of porcine epidemic diarrhea into Canadian swine herds, 2014

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) emerged into Canada in January 2014, primarily affecting sow herds. Subsequent epidemiological analyses suggested contaminated feed was the most likely transmission pathway. The primary objective of this study was to describe general biosecurity and management practices implemented in PEDV-positive sow herds and matched control herds at the time the virus emerged. The secondary objective was to determine if any of these general biosecurity and farm management practices were important in explaining PEDV infection status from January 22, 2014 to March 1, 2014. A case herd was defined as a swine herd with clinical signs and a positive test result for PEDV. A questionnaire was used to a gather 30-day history of herd management practices, animal movements on/off site, feed management practices, semen deliveries and biosecurity practices for case (n = 8) and control (n = 12) herds, primarily located in Ontario. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and random forests (RFs). Case herds were larger in size than control herds. Case herds had more animal movements and non-staff movements onto the site. Also, case herds had higher quantities of pigs delivered, feed deliveries and semen deliveries on-site. The biosecurity practices of case herds were considered more rigorous based on herd management, feed deliveries, transportation and truck driver practices than control herds. The RF model found that the most important variables for predicting herd status were related to herd size and feed management variables. Nonetheless, predictive accuracy of the final RF model was 72%.

COVID and CopMich: comparing and contrasting COVID-19 experiences in the USA and Scandinavia

On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease, COVID-19, a global pandemic. Across the world, governments took action to slow the spread and hospitals rushed to accommodate an influx of patients with this highly infectious and lethal disease. The urology departments in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA, and Herlev and Gentofte, Copenhagen, Denmark — which are linked by the pre-existing CopMich Collaborative — had to respond with massive changes to the organization, staffing and workload of their teams. In this Viewpoint, authors from different urological subspecialties and at different career stages reflect on their experiences during the pandemic. Although their countries’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic differed radically, the similarities between the responses in Copenhagen and Michigan demonstrate the universal characteristics of medicine and the value of teamwork, flexibility and collaboration.

Compounds with anti-influenza activity: present and future of strategies for the optimal treatment and management of influenza Part II: Future compounds against influenza virus

In the first part of this overview, we described the life cycle of the influenza virus and the pharmacological action of the currently available drugs. This second part provides an overview of the molecular mechanisms and targets of still-experimental drugs for the treatment and management of influenza. Briefly, we can distinguish between compounds with anti-influenza activity that target influenza virus proteins or genes, and molecules that target host components that are essential for viral replication and propagation. These latter compounds have been developed quite recently. Among the first group, we will focus especially on hemagglutinin, M2 channel and neuraminidase inhibitors. The second group of compounds may pave the way for personalized treatment and influenza management. Combination therapies are also discussed. In recent decades, few antiviral molecules against influenza virus infections have been available; this has conditioned their use during human and animal outbreaks. Indeed, during seasonal and pandemic outbreaks, antiviral drugs have usually been administered in mono-therapy and, sometimes, in an uncontrolled manner to farm animals. This has led to the emergence of viral strains displaying resistance, especially to compounds of the amantadane family. For this reason, it is particularly important to develop new antiviral drugs against influenza viruses. Indeed, although vaccination is the most powerful means of mitigating the effects of influenza epidemics, antiviral drugs can be very useful, particularly in delaying the spread of new pandemic viruses, thereby enabling manufacturers to prepare large quantities of pandemic vaccine. In addition, antiviral drugs are particularly valuable in complicated cases of influenza, especially in hospitalized patients. To write this overview, we mined various databases, including Embase, PubChem, DrugBank and Chemical Abstracts Service, and patent repositories.

Neuropathy target esterase (NTE/PNPLA6) and organophosphorus compound-induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN)()

Systemic inhibition of neuropathy target esterase (NTE) with certain organophosphorus (OP) compounds produces OP compound-induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN), a distal degeneration of axons in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), thereby providing a powerful model for studying a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. Axonopathies are important medical entities in their own right, but in addition, illnesses once considered primary neuronopathies are now thought to begin with axonal degeneration. These disorders include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, conditional knockout of NTE in the mouse CNS produces vacuolation and other degenerative changes in large neurons in the hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum, along with degeneration and swelling of axons in ascending and descending spinal cord tracts. In humans, NTE mutations cause a variety of neurodegenerative conditions resulting in a range of deficits including spastic paraplegia and blindness. Mutations in the Drosophila NTE orthologue SwissCheese (SWS) produce neurodegeneration characterized by vacuolization that can be partially rescued by expression of wild-type human NTE, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for certain human neurological disorders. This chapter defines NTE and OPIDN, presents an overview of OP compounds, provides a rationale for NTE research, and traces the history of discovery of NTE and its relationship to OPIDN. It then briefly describes subsequent studies of NTE, including practical applications of the assay; aspects of its domain structure, subcellular localization, and tissue expression; abnormalities associated with NTE mutations, knockdown, and conventional or conditional knockout; and hypothetical models to help guide future research on elucidating the role of NTE in OPIDN.

Metagenomic analysis of viruses in toilet waste from long distance flights—A new procedure for global infectious disease surveillance

Human viral pathogens are a major public health threat. Reliable information that accurately describes and characterizes the global occurrence and transmission of human viruses is essential to support national and global priority setting, public health actions, and treatment decisions. However, large areas of the globe are currently without surveillance due to limited health care infrastructure and lack of international cooperation. We propose a novel surveillance strategy, using metagenomic analysis of toilet material from international air flights as a method for worldwide viral disease surveillance. The aim of this study was to design, implement, and evaluate a method for viral analysis of airplane toilet waste enabling simultaneous detection and quantification of a wide range of human viral pathogens. Toilet waste from 19 international airplanes was analyzed for viral content, using viral capture probes followed by high-throughput sequencing. Numerous human pathogens were detected including enteric and respiratory viruses. Several geographic trends were observed with samples originating from South Asia having significantly higher viral species richness as well as higher abundances of salivirus A, aichivirus A and enterovirus B, compared to samples originating from North Asia and North America. In addition, certain city specific trends were observed, including high numbers of rotaviruses in airplanes departing from Islamabad. Based on this study we believe that central sampling and analysis at international airports could be a useful supplement for global viral surveillance, valuable for outbreak detection and for guiding public health resources.

Detection and phylogenetic characterization of astroviruses in insectivorous bats from Central‐Southern Italy

In recent years, bats have been found to harbour many viruses, raising several questions about their role as reservoirs and potential disseminators of zoonotic viruses. We investigated the presence of six virus families in bats in three regions of Central‐Southern Italy. Astroviruses were identified in seven of 13 bat species. Sequence analysis revealed marked genetic heterogeneity among the astroviruses identified, with nucleotide identity ranging between 60.26% and 87.62%. Astrovirus diversity was not associated with the bat species, the geographic areas or the bat colony, suggesting the circulation of several astrovirus strains in Italian ecosystems. Genetic diversification and interspecies transmission appear common in bat astroviruses and could provide, potentially, the bases for transmission to humans and other mammals. Yet overemphasizing this risk might have detrimental consequences for bat conservation and preservation of the important ecosystem services bats provide.

Use of ward closure to control outbreaks among hospitalized patients in acute care settings: a systematic review

BACKGROUND: Though often used to control outbreaks, the efficacy of ward closure is unclear. This systematic review sought to identify studies defining and describing ward closure in outbreak control and to determine impact of ward closure as an intervention on outbreak containment. METHODS: We searched these databases with no language restrictions: MEDLINE, 1946 to 7 July 2014; EMBASE, 1974 to 7 July 2014; CINAHL, 1937 to 8 July 2014; and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2005 to May 2014. We also searched the following: IndMED; LILACS; reference lists from retrieved articles; conference proceedings; and websites of the CDCP, the ICID, and the WHO. We included studies of patients hospitalized in acute care facilities; used ward closure as a control measure; used other control measures; and discussed control of the outbreak(s) under investigation. A component approach was used to assess study quality. RESULTS: We included 97 English and non-English observational studies. None included a controlled comparison between ward closure and other interventions. We found that ward closure was often used as part of a bundle of interventions but could not determine its direct impact separate from all the other interventions whether used in parallel or in sequence with other interventions. We also found no universal definition of ward closure which was widely accepted. CONCLUSIONS: With no published controlled studies identified, ward closure for control of outbreaks remains an intervention that is not evidence based and healthcare personnel will need to continue to balance the competing risks associated with its use, taking into consideration the nature of the outbreak, the type of pathogen and its virulence, mode of transmission, and the setting in which it occurs. Our review has identified a major research gap in this area.

Virus-Specific Immune Memory at Peripheral Sites of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2) Infection in Guinea Pigs

Despite its importance in modulating HSV-2 pathogenesis, the nature of tissue-resident immune memory to HSV-2 is not completely understood. We used genital HSV-2 infection of guinea pigs to assess the type and location of HSV-specific memory cells at peripheral sites of HSV-2 infection. HSV-specific antibody-secreting cells were readily detected in the spleen, bone marrow, vagina/cervix, lumbosacral sensory ganglia, and spinal cord of previously-infected animals. Memory B cells were detected primarily in the spleen and to a lesser extent in bone marrow but not in the genital tract or neural tissues suggesting that the HSV-specific antibody-secreting cells present at peripheral sites of HSV-2 infection represented persisting populations of plasma cells. The antibody produced by these cells isolated from neural tissues of infected animals was functionally relevant and included antibodies specific for HSV-2 glycoproteins and HSV-2 neutralizing antibodies. A vigorous IFN-γ-secreting T cell response developed in the spleen as well as the sites of HSV-2 infection in the genital tract, lumbosacral ganglia and spinal cord following acute HSV-2 infection. Additionally, populations of HSV-specific tissue-resident memory T cells were maintained at these sites and were readily detected up to 150 days post HSV-2 infection. Unlike the persisting plasma cells, HSV-specific memory T cells were also detected in uterine tissue and cervicothoracic region of the spinal cord and at low levels in the cervicothoracic ganglia. Both HSV-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) resident memory cell subsets were maintained long-term in the genital tract and sensory ganglia/spinal cord following HSV-2 infection. Together these data demonstrate the long-term maintenance of both humoral and cellular arms of the adaptive immune response at the sites of HSV-2 latency and virus shedding and highlight the utility of the guinea pig infection model to investigate tissue-resident memory in the setting of HSV-2 latency and spontaneous reactivation.

Rapid detection of reassortment of pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza virus

BACKGROUND: Influenza viruses can generate novel reassortants in co-infected cells. The global circulation and occasional introductions of pandemic H1N1/2009 virus in humans and in pigs, respectively, might provide opportunities for this virus to reassort with other influenza viruses. These possible reassortment events might alter virulence and/or transmissibility of the new reassortants. Investigations that can detect such possible reassortants should therefore be included as a part of pandemic influenza surveillance plans. METHODS: We established a real-time RT-PCR-based strategy for the detection of reassortment of pandemic H1N1/2009 virus. Singleplex SYBR green-based RT-PCR assays specific for each gene segment of pandemic H1N1/2009 were developed. These assays were evaluated by influenza viruses with different genetic backgrounds. RESULTS: All human pandemic H1N1 (N=27) and all seasonal human (N=58) isolates were positive and negative, respectively, for all 8 segments. Of 48 swine influenza viruses isolated from our on-going surveillance program of influenza viruses in swine, 10 were positive in all reactions. All 8 viral segments of these 10 samples were confirmed to be of pandemic H1N1 origin, indicating that these were caused by zoonotic transmissions from human to pigs. The 38 swine viruses that are non-pandemic H1N1/2009 had 1 to 6 gene segments positive in the tests. Further characterization of these non-pandemic H1N1/2009 swine viruses indicated that these PCR positive genes are the precursor genes of pandemic H1N1/2009 virus. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that these assays can detect re-introductions of pandemic H1N1/2009 virus in pigs. These assays might be useful screening tools for identifying viral reassortants derived from pandemic H1N1/2009 or its precursors.

Evaluation of reference genes for real-time quantitative PCR studies in Candida glabrata following azole treatment

BACKGROUND: The selection of stable and suitable reference genes for real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is a crucial prerequisite for reliable gene expression analysis under different experimental conditions. The present study aimed to identify reference genes as internal controls for gene expression studies by RT-qPCR in azole-stimulated Candida glabrata. RESULTS: The expression stability of 16 reference genes under fluconazole stress was evaluated using fold change and standard deviation computations with the hkgFinder tool. Our data revealed that the mRNA expression levels of three ribosomal RNAs (RDN5.8, RDN18, and RDN25) remained stable in response to fluconazole, while PGK1, UBC7, and UBC13 mRNAs showed only approximately 2.9-, 3.0-, and 2.5-fold induction by azole, respectively. By contrast, mRNA levels of the other 10 reference genes (ACT1, EF1α, GAPDH, PPIA, RPL2A, RPL10, RPL13A, SDHA, TUB1, and UBC4) were dramatically increased in C. glabrata following antifungal treatment, exhibiting changes ranging from 4.5- to 32.7-fold. We also assessed the expression stability of these reference genes using the 2(-ΔΔCT) method and three other software packages. The stability rankings of the reference genes by geNorm and the 2(-ΔΔCT) method were identical to those by hkgFinder, whereas the stability rankings by BestKeeper and NormFinder were notably different. We then validated the suitability of six candidate reference genes (ACT1, PGK1, RDN5.8, RDN18, UBC7, and UBC13) as internal controls for ten target genes in this system using the comparative C(T) method. Our validation experiments passed for all six reference genes analyzed except RDN18, where the amplification efficiency of RDN18 was different from that of the ten target genes. Finally, we demonstrated that the relative quantification of target gene expression varied according to the endogenous control used, highlighting the importance of the choice of internal controls in such experiments. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the use of RDN5.8, UBC13, and PGK1 alone or the combination of RDN5.8 plus UBC13 or PGK1 as reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis of gene expression in C. glabrata following azole treatment. In contrast, we show that ACT1 and other commonly used reference genes (GAPDH, PPIA, RPL13A, TUB1, etc.) were not validated as good internal controls in the current model.

Viral etiologies of influenza‐like illness and severe acute respiratory infections in Thailand

BACKGROUND: Information on the burden, characteristics and seasonality of non‐influenza respiratory viruses is limited in tropical countries. OBJECTIVES: Describe the epidemiology of selected non‐influenza respiratory viruses in Thailand between June 2010 and May 2014 using a sentinel surveillance platform established for influenza. METHODS: Patients with influenza‐like illness (ILI; history of fever or documented temperature ≥38°C, cough, not requiring hospitalization) or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI; history of fever or documented temperature ≥38°C, cough, onset <10 days, requiring hospitalization) were enrolled from 10 sites. Throat swabs were tested for influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus (MPV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1‐3, and adenoviruses by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real‐time reverse transcriptase‐PCR. RESULTS: We screened 15 369 persons with acute respiratory infections and enrolled 8106 cases of ILI (5069 cases <15 years old) and 1754 cases of SARI (1404 cases <15 years old). Among ILI cases <15 years old, influenza viruses (1173, 23%), RSV (447, 9%), and adenoviruses (430, 8%) were the most frequently identified respiratory viruses tested, while for SARI cases <15 years old, RSV (196, 14%) influenza (157, 11%) and adenoviruses (90, 6%) were the most common. The RSV season significantly overlapped the larger influenza season from July to November in Thailand. CONCLUSIONS: The global expansion of influenza sentinel surveillance provides an opportunity to gather information on the characteristics of cases positive for non‐influenza respiratory viruses, particularly seasonality, although adjustments to case definitions may be required.

Impact of TGEV infection on the pig small intestine

BACKGROUND: Pig diarrhea causes high mortality and large economic losses in the swine industry. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) causes pig diarrhea, with 100% mortality in piglets less than 2 weeks old. No investigation has yet been made of the small intestine of piglets that survived infection by TGEV. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the impact of TGEV infection on the small intestine of recovered pigs. RESULTS: Histological analyses showed that TGEV infection led to villi atrophy, and reduced villous height and crypt depth. The number of SIgA positive cells, CD3(+)T cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) in jejunum decreased after TGEV infection in vivo. In contrast, microfold cell (M cell) numbers and cell proliferation increased in infected pigs. TGEV infection also significantly enhanced the mRNA expression levels of cytokine IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, and TGF-β. Additionally, lower gene copy numbers of Lactobacillus, and higher numbers of Enterobacteriaceae, were detected in mucosal scraping samples from TGEV-infected pigs. CONCLUSIONS: TGEV infection damages the small intestine, impairs immune functions, and increases pathogenic bacterial loading, all of which may facilitate secondary infections by other pathogens. These findings help quantify the impact of TGEV infection and clarify the pathogenic mechanisms underlying its effects in pigs.

Individual sequences in large sets of gene sequences may be distinguished efficiently by combinations of shared sub-sequences

BACKGROUND: Most current DNA diagnostic tests for identifying organisms use specific oligonucleotide probes that are complementary in sequence to, and hence only hybridise with the DNA of one target species. By contrast, in traditional taxonomy, specimens are usually identified by 'dichotomous keys' that use combinations of characters shared by different members of the target set. Using one specific character for each target is the least efficient strategy for identification. Using combinations of shared bisectionally-distributed characters is much more efficient, and this strategy is most efficient when they separate the targets in a progressively binary way. RESULTS: We have developed a practical method for finding minimal sets of sub-sequences that identify individual sequences, and could be targeted by combinations of probes, so that the efficient strategy of traditional taxonomic identification could be used in DNA diagnosis. The sizes of minimal sub-sequence sets depended mostly on sequence diversity and sub-sequence length and interactions between these parameters. We found that 201 distinct cytochrome oxidase subunit-1 (CO1) genes from moths (Lepidoptera) were distinguished using only 15 sub-sequences 20 nucleotides long, whereas only 8–10 sub-sequences 6–10 nucleotides long were required to distinguish the CO1 genes of 92 species from the 9 largest orders of insects. CONCLUSION: The presence/absence of sub-sequences in a set of gene sequences can be used like the questions in a traditional dichotomous taxonomic key; hybridisation probes complementary to such sub-sequences should provide a very efficient means for identifying individual species, subtypes or genotypes. Sequence diversity and sub-sequence length are the major factors that determine the numbers of distinguishing sub-sequences in any set of sequences.

Epidemiologic data and pathogen genome sequences: a powerful synergy for public health

Epidemiologists aim to inform the design of public health interventions with evidence on the evolution, emergence and spread of infectious diseases. Sequencing of pathogen genomes, together with date, location, clinical manifestation and other relevant data about sample origins, can contribute to describing nearly every aspect of transmission dynamics, including local transmission and global spread. The analyses of these data have implications for all levels of clinical and public health practice, from institutional infection control to policies for surveillance, prevention and treatment. This review highlights the range of epidemiological questions that can be addressed from the combination of genome sequence and traditional ‘line lists’ (tables of epidemiological data where each line includes demographic and clinical features of infected individuals). We identify opportunities for these data to inform interventions that reduce disease incidence and prevalence. By considering current limitations of, and challenges to, interpreting these data, we aim to outline a research agenda to accelerate the genomics-driven transformation in public health microbiology.

Rapid and sensitive detection of multiple genes from the SARS‐Coronavirus using quantitative RT‐PCR with dual systems

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was caused by a newly identified coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) in 2003. To detect early SARS‐CoV infection, a one‐step, real‐time quantitative reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) assay was developed that could simultaneously detect nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and spike (S) genes of SARS‐CoV with the same PCR condition using either Applied Biosystems (ABI) Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System or Roche LightCycler. The sensitivity of this assay was evaluated using cell culture‐derived viruses, in vitro transcribed viral RNA, and clinical specimens. The SARS‐S, ‐M, and ‐N primer/probe sets described in this paper could detect one to ten copies of in vitro transcribed S, M, and N RNA per test using both the ABI and Roche assay systems. The relative sensitivities for detecting cell culture‐derived SARS‐CoV were 0.01, 0.01, and 0.001 PFU/test, respectively. It showed that SARS‐N has comparable detection efficiencies to SARS2 and SARS3 which are primers sets designed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, SARS‐S and SARS‐M also demonstrated equivalent sensitivity to the commercially available RealArt HPA‐Coronavirus reagents (Artus). The relative sensitivity of these primer/probe sets was also examined using human sera spiked viruses and clinical specimens from four confirmed SARS patients. Similar results as above were obtained. Specificity tests and sequence alignment showed that these primer/probe sets annealed perfectly to 31 isolates of SARS‐CoV; and there was no cross detection with other coronaviruses and human respiratory tract‐associated viruses. Therefore, not only is it compatible with the ABI and Roche systems, this multiple‐gene detection assay also has the merit of being a rapid, safe, sensitive, and specific tool for accurate diagnosis of SARS‐CoV infection.

Kawasaki syndrome and concurrent Coxsackie virus B3 infection

We describe two previously healthy children who were hospitalized in the same period in different departments of our University with clinical signs of Kawasaki syndrome, which were treated with intravenous immunoglobulins and acetylsalicylic acid: in both cases, Coxsackie virus infection was concurrently demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and complement fixation test identified antibodies to serotype B3. In the acute phase, both patients presented hyperechogenic coronary arteries, but no cardiologic sequels in the mid term. The etiological relationship between Kawasaki syndrome and Coxsackie viruses is only hypothetical; however, the eventual identification of ad hoc environmental triggers is advisable in front of children with Kawasaki syndrome, with the aim of optimizing epidemiological surveillance and understanding the intimate biological events of this condition.
