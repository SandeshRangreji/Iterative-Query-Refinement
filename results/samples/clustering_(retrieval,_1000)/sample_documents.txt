Interleukin-6 protects anterior horn neurons from lethal virus-induced injury.

We evaluated the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in neuronal injury after CNS infection. IL-6-/- and IL-6+/+ mice of resistant major histocompatibility complex (MHC) H-2b haplotype intracerebrally infected with Theiler's virus cleared the infection normally without development of viral persistence, lethal neuronal infection, or late phase demyelination. In contrast, infection of IL-6-/- mice on a susceptible H-2q haplotype resulted in frequent deaths and severe neurologic deficits within 2 weeks of infection as compared with infected IL-6+/+ H-2q littermate controls. Morphologic analysis demonstrated dramatic injury to anterior horn neurons of IL-6-/- H-2q mice at 12 d after infection. Infectious viral titers in the CNS (brain and spinal cord combined) were equivalent between IL-6-/- H-2q and IL-6+/+ H-2q mice. In contrast, more viral RNA was detected in the spinal cord of IL-6-/- mice compared with IL-6+/+ H-2q mice. Virus antigen was localized predominantly to anterior horn cells in infected IL-6-/- H-2q mice. IL-6 deletion did not affect the humoral response directed against virus, nor did it affect the expression of CD4, CD8, MHC class I, or MHC class II in the CNS. Importantly, IL-6 was expressed by astrocytes of infected IL-6+/+ mice but not in astrocytes of IL-6-/- mice or uninfected IL-6+/+ mice. Furthermore, expression of various chemokines was robust at 12 d after infection in both H-2b and H-2q IL-6-/- mice, indicating that intrinsic CNS inflammatory responses did not depend on the presence of IL-6. Finally, in vitro analysis of virus-induced death in neuroblastoma-spinal cord-34 motor neurons and primary anterior horn cell neurons showed that IL-6 exerted a neuroprotective effect. These data support the hypothesis that IL-6 plays a critical role in protecting specific populations of neurons from irreversible injury.

Public Health Law and Science in the Community Mitigation Strategy for Covid-19

In a crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic, the role of judges is first and foremost to adjudicate urgent requests for temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions. This means that judges hearing challenges to bans on gatherings, orders to close gun shops, orders to halt abortion care, and detention of civil immigration detainees in crowded and unsanitary conditions are issuing orders based on the parties’ pleadings alone. There is no time—yet—for the discovery, expert testimony, or amicus briefs from professional groups that typically inform assessments of science by judges. This essay examines the role public health science is likely to play in the coming months as judges field challenges to mandatory orders adopted as part of the community mitigation the Covid-19 pandemic. It identifies voluntary guidelines from international and federal health agencies as a resource judges rely on heavily in reviewing emergency communicable disease control orders and argues that transparency of and accountability for guidelines should therefore be held to a higher bar than their voluntary status might otherwise suggest.

Thoracoscopic wedge resection through a single incision using a thin puncture device.

Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has been enthusiastically used as a less-invasive diagnostic or therapeutic surgical procedure in recent years. VATS results in considerably less postoperative pain than traditional thoracotomy incisions. The current trend is to reduce the number of ports and minimize the length of incisions to further reduce postoperative pain, chest wall paresthesia, and length of hospitalization. Although several accounts of reduced port surgery, such as single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), have been reported, there are few descriptions of single-incision thoracoscopic surgery (SITS) using a thin puncture device for a variety of diseases. Herein, we describe a minimally invasive SITS technique using a thin puncture device.

Coronavirus Infection and Diversity in Bats in the Australasian Region

Following the SARS outbreak, extensive surveillance was undertaken globally to detect and identify coronavirus diversity in bats. This study sought to identify the diversity and prevalence of coronaviruses in bats in the Australasian region. We identified four different genotypes of coronavirus, three of which (an alphacoronavirus and two betacoronaviruses) are potentially new species, having less than 90% nucleotide sequence identity with the most closely related described viruses. We did not detect any SARS-like betacoronaviruses, despite targeting rhinolophid bats, the putative natural host taxa. Our findings support the virus-host co-evolution hypothesis, with the detection of Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8 (previously reported in Miniopterus species in China, Hong Kong and Bulgaria) in Australian Miniopterus species. Similarly, we detected a novel betacoronavirus genotype from Pteropus alecto which is most closely related to Bat coronavirus HKU9 identified in other pteropodid bats in China, Kenya and the Philippines. We also detected possible cross-species transmission of bat coronaviruses, and the apparent enteric tropism of these viruses. Thus, our findings are consistent with a scenario wherein the current diversity and host specificity of coronaviruses reflects co-evolution with the occasional host shift.

Usefulness of Cellular Analysis of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid for Predicting the Etiology of Pneumonia in Critically Ill Patients

BACKGROUND: The usefulness of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid cellular analysis in pneumonia has not been adequately evaluated. This study investigated the ability of cellular analysis of BAL fluid to differentially diagnose bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia in adult patients who are admitted to intensive care unit. METHODS: BAL fluid cellular analysis was evaluated in 47 adult patients who underwent bronchoscopic BAL following less than 24 hours of antimicrobial agent exposure. The abilities of BAL fluid total white blood cell (WBC) counts and differential cell counts to differentiate between bacterial and viral pneumonia were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Bacterial pneumonia (n = 24) and viral pneumonia (n = 23) were frequently associated with neutrophilic pleocytosis in BAL fluid. BAL fluid median total WBC count (2,815/µL vs. 300/µL, P<0.001) and percentage of neutrophils (80.5% vs. 54.0%, P = 0.02) were significantly higher in the bacterial pneumonia group than in the viral pneumonia group. In ROC curve analysis, BAL fluid total WBC count showed the best discrimination, with an area under the curve of 0.855 (95% CI, 0.750–0.960). BAL fluid total WBC count ≥510/µL had a sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity of 78.3%, positive likelihood ratio (PLR) of 3.83, and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) of 0.21. When analyzed in combination with serum procalcitonin or C-reactive protein, sensitivity was 95.8%, specificity was 95.7%, PLR was 8.63, and NLR was 0.07. BAL fluid total WBC count ≥510/µL was an independent predictor of bacterial pneumonia with an adjusted odds ratio of 13.5 in multiple logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Cellular analysis of BAL fluid can aid early differential diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia in critically ill patients.

Analysis of factors associated with disease outcomes in hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease

BACKGROUND: Since early December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. This study aimed to investigate the factors affecting the progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Patients tested positive for the COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study. Patients were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an improvement/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9%) had improved/stabilized. The patients in the progression group were significantly older than those in the disease improvement/stabilization group (66 [51, 70] vs. 37 [32, 41] years, Uâ=â4.932, Pâ=â0.001). The progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the improvement/stabilization group (27.3% vs. 3.0%, &#967;â=â9.291, Pâ=â0.018). For all the 78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body temperature at admission was significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6] vs. 37.5 [37.0, 38.4]°C, Uâ=â2.057, Pâ=â0.027). Moreover, the proportion of patients with respiratory failure (54.5% vs. 20.9%, &#967;â=â5.611, Pâ=â0.028) and respiratory rate (34 [18, 48] vs. 24 [16, 60] breaths/min, Uâ=â4.030, Pâ=â0.004) were significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group. C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in the progression group compared to the improvement/stabilization group (38.9 [14.3, 64.8] vs. 10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg/L, Uâ=â1.315, Pâ=â0.024). Albumin was significantly lower in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (36.62â±â6.60 vs. 41.27â±â4.55âg/L, Uâ=â2.843, Pâ=â0.006). Patients in the progression group were more likely to receive high-level respiratory support than in the improvement/stabilization group (&#967;â=â16.01, Pâ=â0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (odds ratio [OR], 8.546; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.628-44.864; Pâ=â0.011), history of smoking (OR, 14.285; 95% CI: 1.577-25.000; Pâ=â0.018), maximum body temperature at admission (OR, 8.999; 95% CI: 1.036-78.147, Pâ=â0.046), respiratory failure (OR, 8.772, 95% CI: 1.942-40.000; Pâ=â0.016), albumin (OR, 7.353, 95% CI: 1.098-50.000; Pâ=â0.003), and C-reactive protein (OR, 10.530; 95% CI: 1.224-34.701, Pâ=â0.028) were risk factors for disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors that led to the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia were identified, including age, history of smoking, maximum body temperature at admission, respiratory failure, albumin, and C-reactive protein. These results can be used to further enhance the ability of management of COVID-19 pneumonia.

Therapeutic or detrimental mobilities? Walking groups for older adults

Abstract The health benefits of walking through greenspace have earned widespread academic attention in recent years and have been termed ‘therapeutic mobilities’. As a result, walking groups are actively encouraged by health professionals as a way to promote ‘healthy ageing’. This paper examines whether the promotion of community-led walking groups relies upon overly optimistic understandings that portray walking in greenspace as an inherently therapeutic practice. Accordingly, this paper introduces the concept of ‘detrimental mobilities’ to explore how the shared movement promoted via walking groups may not always be inherently therapeutic and may have some detrimental impacts on the individuals who take part in these activities. Drawing on findings from in-depth walking interviews with older members of the ‘Walking for Health’ scheme in Southampton, England, this paper examines how mobilities have the potential to disable, as much as they enable, health and wellbeing.

A Broker-Based Framework for the Recommendation of Cloud Services: A Research Proposal

Finding and comparing appropriate cloud services that best fit cloud service consumer requirements can be a complex, time-consuming and cost-intensive process, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. Since there is no “one-fits-all” cloud service provider, companies face the challenge of selecting and combining services from different vendors to meet all their requirements. Therefore, this paper calls for the design of a cloud brokering framework that would enable faster and easier selection of cloud services by recommending appropriate services through a matchmaking system. Drawing on previously conducted studies and considering current issues and practical experiences both from provider and user perspectives, we propose a framework that would identify, rank and recommend cloud services from multiple modules and components to individual consumers. Furthermore, we contribute an early-stage design of a cloud broker framework that considers cloud-service consumers’ sourcing preferences while making new cloud-sourcing decisions and that can be used in the selection and adoption phase of implementing cloud services and/or as part of a multicloud strategy.

Bariatric surgery: risks and rewards.

CONTEXT Over 23 million Americans are afflicted with severe obesity, i.e. their body mass index (in kilograms per square meter) values exceed 35. Of even greater concern is the association of the adiposity with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiopulmonary failure, asthma, pseudotumor cerebri, infertility, and crippling arthritis. OBJECTIVE Diets, exercise, behavioral modification, and drugs are not effective in these individuals. This article examines the effect of surgery on the control of the weight and the comorbidities, as well as the safety of these operations. INTERVENTIONS Although the article focuses on the outcomes of the three most commonly performed operations, i.e. adjustable gastric banding, the gastric bypass, and the biliopancreatic bypass with duodenal switch, it aims for perspective with the inclusion of abandoned and current investigational procedures, a review of the complications, and an emphasis on the appropriate selection of patients. POSITIONS: Ample evidence, including controlled randomized studies, now document that bariatric surgery produces durable weight loss exceeding 100 lb (46 kg), full and long-term remission of type 2 diabetes in over 80% with salutary effects on the other comorbidities as well with significant reductions in all-cause mortality. Although the severely obese present with serious surgical risks, bariatric surgery is performed safely with a 0.35% 90-d mortality in Centers of Excellence throughout the United States-similar to the complication rates after cholecystectomy. CONCLUSIONS Until better approaches become available, bariatric surgery is the therapy of choice for patients with severe obesity.

Neonatal calf diarrhea induced by rotavirus

This presentation summarizes the results of a comprehensive study on rotaviruses isolated in Italy from calves and rabbits affected by neonatal diarrhea. The results clearly indicated that rotavirus infection is widespread and supported the evidence for an etiologic role of these viruses in neonatal diarrhea. The evidence of differences in virulence among bovine rotaviruses appeared also to be confirmed. Conventionally reared calves were fully susceptible to the experimental infection induced by three rotaviruses originating from heterologous hosts, i.e. monkeys, pigs and rabbits, respectively. When rotavirus strains of bovine, simian, porcine and rabbit origin were compared by cross neutralization tests, it was found the simian and porcine strains were indistinguishable and both appeared to relate antigenically to the bovine strain. On the other hand, a reciprocal antigenic correlation was found between bovine and rabbit isolates. Finally, it was proven that feeding newborn calves with colostrum of their dams, previously vaccinated with an inactivated rotavirus vaccine, could prevent the neonatal diarrhea from occurring.

Inferring transmission trees to guide targeting of interventions against visceral leishmaniasis and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis

Understanding of spatiotemporal transmission of infectious diseases has improved significantly in recent years. Advances in Bayesian inference methods for individual-level geo-located epidemiological data have enabled reconstruction of transmission trees and quantification of disease spread in space and time, while accounting for uncertainty in missing data. However, these methods have rarely been applied to endemic diseases or ones in which asymptomatic infection plays a role, for which novel estimation methods are required. Here, we develop such methods to analyse longitudinal incidence data on visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and its sequela, post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), in a highly endemic community in Bangladesh. Incorporating recent data on infectiousness of VL and PKDL, we show that while VL cases drive transmission when incidence is high, the contribution of PKDL increases significantly as VL incidence declines (reaching 55% in this setting). Transmission is highly focal: >85% of mean distances from inferred infectors to their secondary VL cases were <300m, and estimated average times from infector onset to secondary case infection were <4 months for 90% of VL infectors, but up to 2.75yrs for PKDL infectors. Estimated numbers of secondary VL cases per VL and PKDL case varied from 0-6 and were strongly correlated with the infector's duration of symptoms. Counterfactual simulations suggest that prevention of PKDL could have reduced VL incidence by up to a quarter. These results highlight the need for prompt detection and treatment of PKDL to achieve VL elimination in the Indian subcontinent and provide quantitative estimates to guide spatiotemporally-targeted interventions against VL.

Discussing Serious News Remotely: Navigating Difficult Conversations During a Pandemic.

The 2020 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has led to an increasing number of telemedicine clinician-patient encounters through telephone or videoconference. This provides a particular challenge in cancer care, where discussions frequently pertain to serious topics and are preferably performed in person. In this review, we use the SPIKES (Setting, Perception, Invitation, Knowledge, Empathy/Emotion, and Strategy/Summarize) protocol as a framework for how to approach the discussion of serious news through telemedicine. We discuss the practical and technical aspects of preparation for a remote conversation and review some differences, limitations, and advantages of these discussions. The greatest challenge with the medium is the loss of the ability to read and display nonverbal cues. Vigilant attention to proven communication strategies and solicitation of patient involvement with the discussion can allow the care provider to display empathy at a distance. Having serious discussions through telemedicine is likely unavoidable for many providers in this unprecedented time. This summary provides some strategies to help to maintain the high standard of care that we all seek for our patients who are receiving serious news.

Olfactory Dysfunction in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients: Observational Cohort Study and Systematic Review

BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) has been reported in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, there are knowledge gaps about the severity, prevalence, etiology, and duration of OD in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Olfactory function was assessed in all participants using questionnaires and the butanol threshold test (BTT). Patients with COVID-19 and abnormal olfaction were further evaluated using the smell identification test (SIT), sinus imaging, and nasoendoscopy. Selected patients received nasal biopsies. Systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. PubMed items from January 1, 2020 to April 23, 2020 were searched. Studies that reported clinical data on olfactory disturbances in COVID-19 patients were analyzed. RESULTS: We included 18 COVID-19 patients and 18 controls. Among COVID-19 patients, 12 of 18 (67%) reported olfactory symptoms and OD was confirmed in 6 patients by BTT and SIT. Olfactory dysfunction was the only symptom in 2 patients. Mean BTT score of patients was worse than controls (P = .004, difference in means = 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.6–2.9). Sinusitis and olfactory cleft obstruction were absent in most patients. Immunohistochemical analysis of nasal biopsy revealed the presence of infiltrative CD68(+) macrophages harboring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen in the stroma. Olfactory dysfunction persisted in 2 patients despite clinical recovery. Systematic review showed that the prevalence of olfactory disturbances in COVID-19 ranged from 5% to 98%. Most studies did not assess olfaction quantitatively. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory dysfunction is common in COVID-19 and may be the only symptom. Coronavirus disease 2019-related OD can be severe and prolonged. Mucosal infiltration by CD68(+) macrophages expressing SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen may contribute to COVID-19-related OD.

An Analysis of 38 Pregnant Women With COVID-19, Their Newborn Infants, and Maternal-Fetal Transmission of SARS-CoV-2

The emergence of a novel coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV-2, and the potentially life-threatening respiratory disease that it can produce, COVID-19, has rapidly spread across the globe, creating a massive public health problem Previous epidemics of many emerging viral infections have typically resulted in poor obstetric outcomes including maternal morbidity and mortality, maternal-fetal transmission of the virus, and perinatal infections and death This article reviews the effects of 2 previous coronavirus infections-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS) caused by MERS-CoV-on pregnancy outcomes In addition, it analyzes literature describing 38 pregnant women with COVID-19 and their newborns in China to assess the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the mothers and infants, including clinical, laboratory, and virologic data, and the transmissibility of the virus from mother to fetus This analysis reveals that unlike coronavirus infections of pregnant women caused by SARS and MERS, in these 38 pregnant women COVID-19 did not lead to maternal deaths Importantly, and similar to pregnancies with SARS and MERS, there were no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mothers with COVID-19 to their fetuses All neonatal specimens tested, including placentas in some cases, were negative by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 At this point in the global pandemic of COVID-19 infection there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes intrauterine or transplacental transmission from infected pregnant women to their fetuses Analysis of additional cases is necessary to determine if this remains true

Evaluation of Stationary Wavelet Transforms in Reconstruction of Pure High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs)

High frequency oscillations (HFO) from, MEG (magnetoencephalography) and intracerebral EEG are considered as effective tools to identify cognitive status and several cortical disorders especially in epilepsy diagnosis. The aim of our study is to evaluate stationary wavelet transform (SWT) technique performance in efficient reconstruction of pure epileptic high frequency oscillations, reputed as biomarkers of epileptogenic zones: generators of inter ictal epileptic discharges, and offhand seizures. We applied SWT on simulated and real database to detect non-contaminated HFO by spiky element. For simulated data, we computed the GOF of reconstruction that reaches for all studied constraint (relative amplitude, frequency, SNR and overlap) a promising results. For real data we used time frequency domain to evaluate SWT robustness of HFO reconstruction. We proved that SWT is an efficient filtering technique for separation HFO from spiky events. Our results would have an important impact on the definition of epileptogenic zones.

Instant reocclusion following mechanical thrombectomy of in situ thromboocclusion and the role of low-dose intra-arterial tirofiban.

BACKGROUND An in situ thromboocclusion (IST) is defined as an infarct extensively involving all or most of a stenosed arterial territory, which is one major stroke mechanism related to intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS). We focused on ISTs occurring in major cerebral arteries and analyzed their rate of instant reocclusion during mechanical thrombectomy (MT) compared with non-ISTs. Also, we introduced a treatment strategy of low-dose intra-arterial tirofiban administration to prevent such reocclusion following repeat recanalization, and evaluated its safety and efficacy. METHODS We analyzed 168 consecutive patients treated with MT over a 2-year period from May 2011 to April 2013. During MT, if angiography following a successful recanalization showed stenosis at the occlusion site, we performed additional angiographic runs every 10 min for 30 min after the recanalization. Then, if angiography revealed reocclusion, we performed a repeat recanalization, using the same MT technique but additionally followed by low-dose intra-arterial tirofiban infusion. Time-of-flight MR angiography or CT angiography was performed to confirm any underlying ICAS at the occlusion site 5-7 days after the procedure. The patients who had confirmed underlying ICAS were included in the IST cohort. RESULTS Of 168 enrolled patients, we excluded 36 who could not be checked for underlying ICAS at the occlusion site for one of the following reasons: recanalization failure (n = 11), rescue stenting after tirofiban failure (n = 5) and lack of follow-up vascular imaging (n = 20). The incidence of IST was 30.3% (40/132). All IST patients were confirmed to have underlying ICAS by follow-up vascular imaging. Instant reocclusion after successful recanalization was significantly more frequent in the IST cohort [26/40 (65%) vs. 3/92 (3.3%); p < 0.001]. Regarding the efficacy of low-dose intra-arterial tirofiban infusion, 85.7% of the reocclusion patients finally achieved a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score 2/3 recanalization, but in the remaining 14.3% of the cases, the condition was refractory to the procedure and required rescue stenting. There were no cases of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage following the procedure. CONCLUSIONS In situ thromboocclusion was characterized by a significantly higher chance of instant reocclusion during MT. In such cases, low-dose intra-arterial tirofiban administration may be effective and safe. However, future confirmation by prospective multicenter trials seems necessary.

A nested set of eight RNAs is formed in macrophages infected with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus.

Total RNA was extracted from primary cultures of mouse macrophages isolated from 10-day-old mice 6 to 12 h postinfection with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV). Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from spleens of 18-h LDV-infected mice. The RNAs were analyzed by Northern (RNA) blot hybridization with a number of LDV-specific cDNAs as probes. A cDNA representing the nucleocapsid protein (VP-1) gene located at the 3' terminus of the viral genome (E. K. Godeny, D. W. Speicher, and M. A. Brinton, Virology 177:768-771, 1990) hybridized to viral genomic RNA of about 13 kb plus seven subgenomic RNAs ranging in size from about 1 to about 3.6 kb. Two other cDNA clones hybridized only to the four or five largest subgenomic RNAs, respectively. In contrast, two cDNAs encoding continuous open reading frames with replicase and zinc finger motifs hybridized only to the genomic RNA. The replicase motif exhibited 75% amino acid identity to that of the 1b protein of equine arteritis virus (EAV) and 44% amino acid identity to those of the 1b proteins of coronaviruses and Berne virus. Combined, the results indicate that LDV replication involves formation of a 3'-coterminal-nested set of mRNAs as observed for coronaviruses and toroviruses as well as for EAV, with which LDV shares many other properties. Overall, LDV, like EAV, possesses a genome organization resembling that of the coronaviruses and toroviruses. However, EAV and LDV differ from the latter in the size of their genomes, virion size and structure, nature of the structural proteins, and symmetry of the nucleocapsids.

Preliminary evidence from a multicenter prospective observational study of the safety and efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19

BACKGROUND: Effective therapies are urgently needed for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Chloroquine has been proved to have antiviral effect against coronavirus in vitro. In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of chloroquine with different doses in COVID-19. METHOD: In this multicenter prospective observational study, we enrolled patients older than 18 years old with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection excluding critical cases from 12 hospitals in Guangdong and Hubei Provinces. Eligible patients received chloroquine phosphate 500 mg, orally, once (half dose) or twice (full dose) daily. Patients treated with non-chloroquine therapy were included as historical controls. The primary endpoint is the time to undetectable viral RNA. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with undetectable viral RNA by day 10 and 14, hospitalization time, duration of fever, and adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 197 patients completed chloroquine treatment, and 176 patients were included as historical controls. The median time to achieve an undetectable viral RNA was shorter in chloroquine than in non-chloroquine (absolute difference in medians -6.0 days; 95% CI -6.0 to -4.0). The duration of fever is shorter in chloroquine (geometric mean ratio 0.6; 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8). No serious adverse events were observed in the chloroquine group. Patients treated with half dose experienced lower rate of adverse events than with full dose. CONCLUSIONS: Although randomised trials are needed for further evaluation, this study provides evidence for safety and efficacy of chloroquine in COVID-19 and suggests that chloroquine can be a cost-effective therapy for combating the COVID-19 pandemic.

Contamination of Health Care Personnel During Removal of Personal Protective Equipment.

IMPORTANCE Contamination of the skin and clothing of health care personnel during removal of personal protective equipment (PPE) contributes to dissemination of pathogens and places personnel at risk for infection. OBJECTIVES To determine the frequency and sites of contamination on the skin and clothing of personnel during PPE removal and to evaluate the effect of an intervention on the frequency of contamination. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a point-prevalence study and quasi-experimental intervention from October 28, 2014, through March 31, 2015. Data analysis began November 17, 2014, and ended April 21, 2015. Participants included a convenience sample of health care personnel from 4 Northeast Ohio hospitals who conducted simulations of contaminated PPE removal using fluorescent lotion and a cohort of health care personnel from 7 study units in 1 medical center that participated in a quasi-experimental intervention that included education and practice in removal of contaminated PPE with immediate visual feedback based on fluorescent lotion contamination of skin and clothing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were the frequency and sites of contamination on skin and clothing of personnel after removal of contaminated gloves or gowns at baseline vs after the intervention. A secondary end point focused on the correlation between contamination of skin with fluorescent lotion and bacteriophage MS2, a nonpathogenic, nonenveloped virus. RESULTS Of 435 glove and gown removal simulations, contamination of skin or clothing with fluorescent lotion occurred in 200 (46.0%), with a similar frequency of contamination among the 4 hospitals (range, 42.5%-50.3%). Contamination occurred more frequently during removal of contaminated gloves than gowns (52.9% vs 37.8%, P = .002) and when lapses in technique were observed vs not observed (70.3% vs 30.0%, P < .001). The intervention resulted in a reduction in skin and clothing contamination during glove and gown removal (60.0% before the intervention vs 18.9% after, P < .001) that was sustained after 1 and 3 months (12.0% at both time points, P < .001 compared with before the intervention). During simulations of contaminated glove removal, the frequency of skin contamination was similar with fluorescent lotion and bacteriophage MS2 (58.0% vs 52.0%, P = .45). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Contamination of the skin and clothing of health care personnel occurs frequently during removal of contaminated gloves or gowns. Educational interventions that include practice with immediate visual feedback on skin and clothing contamination can significantly reduce the risk of contamination during removal of PPE.

Chapter 14 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Infection

MERS-CoV infection is an emerging infectious disease with a high mortality rate. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disease is not known as we do not have yet reliable serologic tests. The diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection relies on detection of the virus using real-time RT-PCR. Currently, the origin of the virus and the source is not known and future studies are needed to elucidate possible sources and the best therapeutic options.

Cardiac Surgery in Canada During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Guidance Statement From the Canadian Society of Cardiac Surgeons

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic.1 At that time, only 118,000 cases had been reported globally, 90% of which had occurred in 4 countries.1 Since then, the world landscape has changed dramatically. As of March 31, 2020, there are now nearly 800,000 cases, with truly global involvement.2 Countries that were previously unaffected are currently experiencing mounting rates of the novel coronavirus infection with associated increases in COVID-19-related deaths. At present, Canada has more than 8000 cases of COVID-19, with considerable variation in rates of infection among provinces and territories.3 Amid concerns over growing resource constraints, cardiac surgeons from across Canada have been forced to make drastic changes to their clinical practices. From prioritizing and delaying elective cases to altering therapeutic strategies in high-risk patients, cardiac surgeons, along with their heart teams, are having to reconsider how best to manage their patients. It is with this in mind that the Canadian Society of Cardiac Surgeons (CSCS) and its Board of Directors have come together to formulate a series of guiding statements. With strong representation from across the country and the support of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, the authors have attempted to provide guidance to their colleagues on the subjects of leadership roles that cardiac surgeons may assume during this pandemic: patient assessment and triage, risk reduction, and real-time sharing of expertise and experiences.

Transplant patient’s isolation and social distancing due to covid-19: analysis of the resilient capacities of the transplant in the management of the coronavirus’ emergency.

Introduction One of the peculiar aspects of the transplant patient’s life is that in the post-surgery phase he lives in an “isolation” condition, having to pay particular attention to the living environment and preferring a limited social life given that the immunosuppressive treatment entails immunodepression in the patient. In covid 19, likewise in a post surgery situation, social isolation is being implemented. Material and Methods The study started on March 17th 2020 and ended on April 24rd 2020. Interviews consulting/phone were made. The phone questionnaire, submitted to 71 patients, consisted of a set of 15 questions that investigated the structure and the psychological resistance. 8 patients have been monitored exclusively for the psychological aspect through a more articulate supporting path. Results In essence, from the overall analysis of the data deriving from the study of the positioning of patients based on the stage of renal function and the bands related to the development of psychopathological aspects and the use of positive peronal resources, it emerges that patients in stage V "Kidney failure "are in the first bracket as regards the development of psychopathological aspects (absence of these experiences) and in the third bracket as regards the good use of positive resources to deal with isolation. Therefore, it can be deduced that, although with a data that can be expanded, a serious or medium-serious situation from an organic point of view in this socio-health emergency situation is well addressed by the transplanted patient Conclusions Transplant patients have faced the measure of social distancing adequately and in adherence to the treatment, thanks to the phone assistance of all the medical-surgical and psychological team.

[Single incision laparoscopic surgery].

One of the aims of the new technologies and techniques in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is to achieve a surgery without or with minimal visible scars. Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) might be considered to be a paradigm of this development but it has not yet been possible to implement this universally. Nevertheless, the resultant innovation of research into NOTES has enabled "bridge technologies" to be introduced that allow MIS to be developed with the required standards of efficiency and safety. The aim of this paper is to review the concept of single incision surgery and to classify the available tools for its development and implementation.

Case series of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in a military recruit school: clinical, sanitary and logistical implications

INTRODUCTION: A new coronavirus, called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emerged from China in late 2019 and has now caused a worldwide pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 has not been described so far in a military setting. We therefore report a case series of infected patients in a recruit school in Switzerland and the herein associated challenges. METHODS: Retrospective review of COVID-19 cases among Swiss Armed Forces recruits in the early weeks of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the canton of Ticino, the southernmost canton of Switzerland. Positive cases were defined with two positive PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Serological testing was performed with a commercially available kit according to manufacturers' instructions. RESULTS: The first case was likely contaminated while skiing during weekend permission. He became symptomatic 4 days later, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was put into isolation. He showed complete symptom resolution after 48 hours. Quarantine was ordered for all recruits with close contact in the past 2 days, a total of 55 persons out of 140 in the company. Seven out of nine recruits in one particular quarantine room became mildly symptomatic. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive in one of them. Seven days after initial diagnosis, the index patient and the other one from the quarantine retested positive for SARS-CoV-2, although they had been completely asymptomatic for over 96 hours. Serological testing revealed positive for both patients. All others showed negative IgM and IgG. CONCLUSIONS: Young healthy recruits often showed a mild course of COVID-19 with rapid symptom decline but were persistent SARS-CoV-2 carriers. This illustrates how asymptomatic patients may be responsible for covert viral transmission. An early and prolonged establishment of isolation and quarantine for patients and close contacts is essential to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, especially in the confined space of a military environment.

Incidental COVID-19 in a Heart-Kidney Transplant Recipient with Malnutrition and Recurrent Infections: Implications for the SARS-CoV-2 Immune Response

The clinical course and outcomes of immunocompromised patients, such as transplant recipients, with COVID-19 remains unclear. It has been postulated that a substantial portion of the disease burden seems to be mediated by the host immune activation to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Herein, we present a simultaneous heart-kidney transplant (SHKT) recipient who was hospitalized for the management of respiratory failure from volume overload complicated by failure to thrive, multiple opportunistic infections, and open non-healing wounds in the setting of worsening renal dysfunction weeks prior to the first case of SARS-CoV-2 being detected in the state of Connecticut. After his third endotracheal intubation, routine nucleic acid testing (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2, in anticipation of a planned tracheostomy, was positive. His hemodynamics, respiratory status and ventilator requirements remained stable without any worsening for 4 weeks until he had a negative NAT test. It is possible that the immunocompromised status of our patient may have prevented significant immune activation leading up to clinically-significant cytokine storm that could have resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome and multisystem organ failure.

Radiolabeling of biodegradable polymeric microspheres with [99mTc(CO)3]+ and in vivo biodistribution evaluation using MicroSPECT/CT imaging.

Poly(L-lactide) (PLA) microspheres tailored with a tridentate chelating group were radiolabeled with [(99m)Tc(H(2)O)(3)(CO)(3)](+) and optimized for labeling efficiency and stability. Various ligand-polymer blend compositions with commercial PLA (from 2% to 100%) were evaluated. Labeling efficiencies over 95% were achieved in a 5 min reaction using 100% of the ligand-polymer or within 15 min using a 5% ligand-polymer blend. The addition of 1.5% of PEGylated copolymer to the blend did not affect the labeling efficiency of these particles but changed their in vivo behavior. MicroSPECT/CT imaging showed significant uptake of non-PEGylated microspheres by the murine lung, while only the liver and spleen took up PEGylated microspheres. Such (99m)Tc radiolabeled biodegradable microspheres will be useful diagnostic imaging agents for visualization of the functioning reticuloendothelial system (RES). Similarly, other sizes of the same microspheres will allow imaging of lung perfusion, bone marrow, lymph and inflammation scintigraphy, and radioembolization therapy.

Health and zoonotic Infections of snow leopards Panthera unica in the South Gobi desert of Mongolia

Background: Snow leopards, Panthera uncia, are a threatened apex predator, scattered across the mountains of Central and South Asia. Disease threats to wild snow leopards have not been investigated.Methods and Results: Between 2008 and 2015, twenty snow leopards in the South Gobi desert of Mongolia were captured and immobilised for health screening and radio-collaring. Blood samples and external parasites were collected for pathogen analyses using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), microscopic agglutination test (MAT), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques. The animals showed no clinical signs of disease, however, serum antibodies to significant zoonotic pathogens were detected. These pathogens included, Coxiella burnetii, (25% prevalence), Leptospira spp., (20%), and Toxoplasma gondii (20%). Ticks collected from snow leopards contained potentially zoonotic bacteria from the genera Bacillus, Bacteroides, Campylobacter, Coxiella, Rickettsia, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus.Conclusions: The zoonotic pathogens identified in this study, in the short-term did not appear to cause illness in the snow leopards, but have caused illness in other wild felids. Therefore, surveillance for pathogens should be implemented to monitor for potential longer- term disease impacts on this snow leopard population.

Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in COVID-19.

Concerns have been raised about the potential for renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors to upregulate expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and thus increase susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry. Currently, there is no evidence that even if RAS inhibitors increase expression and activity of ACE2, that they would increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by facilitating greater viral entry or worsen outcomes in patients with COVID-19. At this time, there is no clinical evidence to suggest that treatment with RAS inhibitors should be discontinued in stable patients with COVID-19. In hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, decisions about these medications should be based on clinical condition, including hemodynamic status and renal function.

The Impact of COVID-19 on People with Diabetes in Brazil

The present study aims atidentifying main barriers faced by people living with diabetes in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In a convenience sampling study, data were collected from 1701 individuals, aged 18 or above; 75.54% female participants; 60.73% T1D and 30.75% T2D, between April 22nd and May 4th, using an anonymous and untraceable survey containing 20 multiple choice questions (socio-demographic; health status and habits of life during COVID-19 pandemic). Relationship between variables was established using the multiple correspondence analysis technique. RESULTS: 95.1% of respondents reduced their frequency of going outside of their homes; among those who monitored blood glucose at home during the pandemic (91.5%), the majority (59.4%) experienced an increase, a decrease or a higher variability in glucose levels; 38.4% postponed their medical appointments and/or routine examinations; and 59.5% reduced their physical activity. T1D, the youngest group, was more susceptible to presenting COVID-19 symptoms despite not being testing; whilst the TD2 group had higher frequency of comorbidities that are additional risk factors for COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a firsthand revelation of the severity of COVID-19 on individuals with diabetes in Brazil, altering their habits, which impacted their glycemia, potentially increasing their risk of poor outcomes if infected by SARS-CoV-2.

The role of public communication in decision making for waste management infrastructure.

Modern waste management provision seeks to meet challenging objectives and strategies while reflecting community aspirations and ensuring cost-effective compliance with statutory obligations. Its social acceptability, which affects both what systems (infrastructure) can be put in place and to what extent their implementation will be successful, is a multi-dimensional phenomenon, often not well understood. In light of the growing evidence that decisions to build new infrastructure are often contested by the public, there is a clear need to understand the role of scientific evidence in public perception, particularly as environmental infrastructure delivery is often objected to by the public on environmental grounds. In this paper the need for waste management infrastructure is reviewed, and the way its delivery in the UK has evolved is used as an example of the role of public perception in the planning and delivery of waste facilities. Findings demonstrate the vital role of public communication in waste management infrastructure delivery. Public perception must be taken into account early in the decision making process, with the public informed and engaged from the start. There is a pressing need for people not simply to accept but to understand and appreciate the need for infrastructure, the nature of infrastructure investments and development, the costs and the benefits involved, and the technological aspects. Scientific evidence and literacy have a critical role to play, facilitating public engagement in a process that empowers people, allowing them to define and handle challenges and influence decisions that will impact their lives. Problem ownership, and an increased probability of any solutions proposed being selected and implemented successfully are potential benefits of such approach.

A Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Patient with Multifocal Pneumonia Treated with Hydroxychloroquine

After an outbreak in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a pandemic. The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCov), now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes a wide spectrum of illness and patients with underlying comorbidities have a high mortality. Here we present a 49-year-old male patient with comorbid conditions who presented with fever, cough, myalgia and shortness of breath for five days with likely exposure to a COVID-19 contact. A computed tomography scan of the thorax revealed multifocal bilateral ground-glass lung opacities with areas of subpleural sparing. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid amplification. Hydroxychloroquine therapy was started, and the patient responded favorably with improvement of symptoms. Early diagnosis and self-isolation or quarantine remain key to stemming the tide of the contagion as there is a real risk of the healthcare system being overwhelmed.

Use of chimeric influenza viruses as a novel internal control for diagnostic rRT-PCR assays

Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is now widely used to detect viral pathogens in various human specimens. The application of internal controls to validate the entire process of these assays is necessary to prevent false-negative results caused by unexpected inhibition or inefficient extraction. In the present study, we describe a strategy to produce a stable internal control for rRT-PCR by packaging foreign RNA into influenza virions using plasmid-based reverse genetics technology. The envelope structure of influenza virus can effectively protect RNA segments from RNase digestion, which provides an advantage for its routine use as an internal control. Utilizing this approach, we successfully generated a recombinant influenza virus (rPR8-HCV) containing the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA genome. After inactivation and purification, the rPR8-HCV particles were demonstrated to be RNase resistant and stable at 4 °C for at least 252 days in human plasma, with no degradation even after being frozen and thawed multiple times. These results were reproducible in the COBAS TaqMan HCV test for 164 days. Moreover, the chimeric influenza virus particles could be easily produced in embryonated eggs and were noninfectious after inactivation treatment. Additionally, this strategy could also be adapted for real-time clinical applications of other RNA targets, providing a universal approach with broad clinical applications in rRT-PCR assays.

Replicative adenoviruses for cancer therapy.

Rapid advances are being made in the engineering of replication-competent viruses to treat cancer. Adenovirus is a mildly pathogenic human virus that propagates prolifically in epithelial cells, the origin of most human cancers. While virologists have revealed many details about its molecular interactions with the cell, applied scientists have developed powerful technologies to genetically modify or regulate every viral protein. In tandem, the limited success of nonreplicative adenoviral vectors in cancer gene therapy has brought the old concept of adenovirus oncolysis back into the spotlight. Major efforts have been directed toward achieving selective replication by the deletion of viral functions dispensable in tumor cells or by the regulation of viral genes with tumor-specific promoters. However, the predicted replication selectivity has not been realized because of incomplete knowledge of the complex virus-cell interactions and the leakiness of cellular promoters in the viral genome. Capsid modifications are being developed to achieve tumor targeting and enhance infectivity. Cellular and viral functions that confer greater oncolytic potency are also being elucidated. Ultimately, the interplay of the virus with the immune system will likely dictate the success of this approach as a cancer therapy.

Virological factors that increase the transmissibility of emerging human viruses.

The early detection of pathogens with epidemic potential is of major importance to public health. Most emerging infections result in dead-end "spillover" events in which a pathogen is transmitted from an animal reservoir to a human but is unable to achieve the sustained human-to-human transmission necessary for a full-blown epidemic. It is therefore critical to determine why only some virus infections are efficiently transmitted among humans whereas others are not. We sought to determine which biological features best characterized those viruses that have achieved sustained human transmission. Accordingly, we compiled a database of 203 RNA and DNA human viruses and used an information theoretic approach to assess which of a set of key biological variables were the best predictors of human-to-human transmission. The variables analyzed were as follows: taxonomic classification; genome length, type, and segmentation; the presence or absence of an outer envelope; recombination frequency; duration of infection; host mortality; and whether or not a virus exhibits vector-borne transmission. This comparative analysis revealed multiple strong associations. In particular, we determined that viruses with low host mortality, that establish long-term chronic infections, and that are nonsegmented, nonenveloped, and, most importantly, not transmitted by vectors were more likely to be transmissible among humans. In contrast, variables including genome length, genome type, and recombination frequency had little predictive power. In sum, we have identified multiple biological features that seemingly determine the likelihood of interhuman viral transmissibility, in turn enabling general predictions of whether viruses of a particular type will successfully emerge in human populations.

Control of virus-induced cell fusion by host cell lipid composition

Abstract Virus-induced cell fusion has been examined in a series of stable cell lines which were originally selected for resistance to the fusogenic effects of polyethylene glycol (PEG). For a wide variety of viruses, including murine hepatitis virus (a coronavirus), vesicular stomatitis virus (a rhabdovirus), and two paramyxoviruses (Sendai virus and SV5), susceptibility to virus-induced fusion was found to be inversely correlated with susceptibility to PEG-induced fusion. This phenomenon was observed both for cell fusion occurring in the course of viral infection and for fusion induced “from without” by the addition of high titers of noninfectious or inactivated virus. The fusion-altered cell lines (fusible by virus but not by PEG) are characterized by their unusual lipid composition, including marked elevation of saturated fatty acids and the presence of an unusual ether-linked neutral lipid. To test the association between lipid composition and fusion, acyl chain saturation was manipulated by supplementing the culture medium with exogenous fatty acids. In such experiments, it was possible to control the responses of these cells to both viral and chemical fusogens. Increasing the cellular content of saturated fatty acyl chains increased the susceptibility of cells to viral fusion and decreased susceptibility to PEG-induced fusion, whereas lowering fatty acid saturation had the opposite effect. Thus, parallel cultures of cells can be either driven toward the PEG-fusible/virus-fusion-resistant phenotype of the parental cells or rendered susceptible to viral fusion but resistant to PEG-induced fusion, solely by the alteration of cellular lipids. The ability of cellular lipid composition to regulate virus-induced membrane fusion suggests a possible role for lipids in viral infection and pathogenesis

A novel role of nifuroxazide in attenuation of sepsis-associated acute lung and myocardial injuries; role of TLR4/NLPR3/IL-1β signaling interruption.

Acute lung injury (ALI) and the subsequent multi-system organ failure is a serious health problem with devastating impacts on the health care systems. Indeed, the world has been facing an un-preceded situation in the past couple of months following COVID-19 infestation and the associated high-mortality rates mainly attributed to sepsis and the associated multiple organ failures of particular concern; acute respiratory distress syndrome post lung injury. The current study provides evidence on the ameliorative impact of nifuroxazide, and FDA approved antidiarrheal drug in attenuation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and myocarditis when administrated either in prophylactic or curative regimens. Nifuroxazide administration was associated with a significant improvement in lung and heart histopathological characteristics and architecture with retraction of LPS-induced inflammatory-infiltration. This was associated with retraction in serum biomarkers of cellular injury of which; LDH, CK-MB, and ALP. Nifuroxazide administration was associated with a significant improvement in both lung and heart oxidative status. Such positive outcomes were underlined by a significant inhibitory effect of nifuroxazide on lung and heart contents of toll-like receptor (4) (TLR4)/the inflammasome NALPR3/interleukin- 1β (IL-1β). In conclusion: Nifuroxazide attenuates LPS-induced ALI and myocardial injury via interruption of TLR4/NALPR3/IL-1β signaling. Thus it can offer a potential approach for attenuation of sepsis in critically ill patients.

COVID-19 in otolaryngologist practice: a review of current knowledge

PURPOSE: Otorhinolaryngological manifestations are common symptoms of COVID-19. This study provides a brief and precise review of the current knowledge regarding COVID-19, including disease transmission, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and potential treatment. The article focused on COVID-19-related information useful in otolaryngologist practice. METHODS: The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using terms "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2" in conjunction with "otorhinolaryngological manifestation", "ENT", and "olfaction". RESULTS: The most common otolaryngological dysfunctions of COVID-19 were cough, sore throat, and dyspnea. Rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and dizziness were also present. COVID-19 could manifest as an isolated sudden hyposmia/anosmia. Upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms were commonly observed in younger patients and usually appeared initially. They could be present even before the molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Otolaryngologists are of great risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 as they cope with URT. ENT surgeons could be easily infected by SARS-CoV-2 during performing surgery in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Ear, nose and throat (ENT) symptoms may precede the development of severe COVID-19. During COVID-19 pandemic, patients with cough, sore throat, dyspnea, hyposmia/anosmia and a history of travel to the region with confirmed COVID-19 patients, should be considered as potential COVID-19 cases. An otolaryngologist should wear FFP3/N95 mask, glasses, disposable and fluid resistant gloves and gown while examining such individuals. Not urgent ENT surgeries should be postponed. Additional studies analyzing why some patients develop ENT symptoms during COVID-19 and others do not are needed. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism leading to anosmia.

Full-thickness skin grafts for surgical defects of the nasal ala - a comprehensive review, approach and outcomes of 186 cases over 9 years.

BACKGROUND Skin cancers of the nasal ala are commonly encountered in dermatological surgery. Various techniques have been described to reconstruct surgical defects of the ala, including melolabial transposition flaps, interpolated melolabial flaps, bilobed and trilobed transposition flaps, island pedicle flaps and spiral flaps. Full-thickness skin grafts have received little attention in the reconstructive literature. OBJECTIVES We present our experience with full-thickness skin grafts for the reconstruction of partial thickness defects of the nasal ala in the largest series to date. METHODS A retrospective analysis of the Mohs micrographic surgery database over a 9-year period was performed. All cases of full-thickness skin grafts for reconstruction of the nasal ala were identified. Defect location, size and any postoperative complications were noted. All patients were reviewed at the time of suture removal, at 3 and 6 weeks postoperatively and at 1 year. RESULTS There were 186 cases in total in 181 patients (88 men and 93 women). Their ages ranged from 31 to 88 years with a mean of 65 years (median 66). Defect size varied from 0·3 × 0·4 cm to 2·0 × 2·7 cm, with the average defect size measuring 1·0-1·2 cm in diameter. Thirty-six per cent (67 of 186) of cases underwent postoperative dermabrasion, and 8% (14 of 186) received postoperative intralesional triamcinolone. The incidence of graft failure and infection was low. Good-to-excellent cosmetic results were seen in all patients and postoperative complications were uncommon and minor. CONCLUSIONS The use of full-thickness skin grafts for defects of the nasal ala is a simple and versatile reconstructive option with excellent functional and aesthetic outcomes.

Métapneumovirus humain

Résumé Le métapneumovirus humain (hMPV) est un nouveau Pneumovirinae apparenté au métapneumovirus aviaire du type C. Le génome du hMPV diffère de celui du virus respiratoire syncytial humain (RSV) par l’ordre des gènes et le manque des gènes non structuraux. Deux sous-groupes génétiques de hMPV et quatre sous-types ont été identifiés. Les infections à hMPV évoluent sous forme d’épidémies hivernales régulières, superposées à celle du RSV et d’importance à peu près égale d’une année sur l’autre. Chez les enfants hospitalisés à Caen, le hMPV est détecté dans 9,7 % des cas, après le RSV (37 %), les rhinovirus (18 %), les virus influenza (15,4 %), les adénovirus (9 %) et les virus parainfluenza (5 %). La plupart des infections à hMPV sont observées chez des enfants atteints de bronchiolites, mais par comparaison à l’infection à RSV, l’atteinte respiratoire basse et les signes de gravité sont moins fréquents. Le hMPV est très difficile à isoler en cultures des cellules. Le diagnostic a reposé jusqu’ici sur la détection moléculaire par RT–PCR. L’apparition récente des tests antigéniques permet de disposer aujourd’hui d’un test de diagnostic rapide, simple et économique. Abstract The human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a new Pneumovirinae related to the avian metapneumovirus type C. hMPV genome differs from human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) genome by the gene order and the lack of nonstructural genes. Two genetic sub-groups and four sub-types of hMPV are identified. hMPV infections evolve as regular winter outbreaks which have roughly the same size and overlaping RSV epidemics. Among hospitalized children in Caen, hMPV is detected in 9.7% of the cases after RSV (37%), rhinovirus (18%), influenza virus (14.5%), adenovirus (9%), and parainfluenza virus (5%). Most of hMPV infections are observed in children suffering from bronchiolitis, but the localization to lower respiratory tract and the severity of the disease are less frequent in comparison with RSV infections. hMPV is very difficult to isolate using cell culture. Up to now, the only way for hMPV diagnosis was the TS–CRP assays. But the recent apparition of direct antigenic tests allows us to get a fair, rapid, and economic diagnostic tool.

Stop Doing Needless Things! Saving Healthcare Resources During COVID-19 and Beyond

The COVID-19 outbreak is putting tremendous strain on the US healthcare system, with a direct impact on medical professionals, hospital systems, and physical resources. While comprehensive public health and regulatory efforts are essential to overcome this crisis, it is important to recognize this moment as an opportunity to provide more intelligent and more efficient care in spite of increasing patient volumes and fewer resources. Specifically, we must limit unnecessary and wasteful medical practices and improve the delivery of those services which enhance the quality of patient care. In doing so, we will increase availability of the critical resources required for the provision of high-quality care to those in greatest need both now and in the future.

Direct-acting antivirals and host-targeting strategies to combat enterovirus infections

Enteroviruses (e.g., poliovirus, enterovirus-A71, coxsackievirus, enterovirus-D68, rhinovirus) include many human pathogens causative of various mild and more severe diseases, especially in young children. Unfortunately, antiviral drugs to treat enterovirus infections have not been approved yet. Over the past decades, several direct-acting inhibitors have been developed, including capsid binders, which block virus entry, and inhibitors of viral enzymes required for genome replication. Capsid binders and protease inhibitors have been clinically evaluated, but failed due to limited efficacy or toxicity issues. As an alternative approach, host-targeting inhibitors with potential broad-spectrum activity have been identified. Furthermore, drug repurposing screens have recently uncovered promising new inhibitors with disparate viral and host targets. Together, these findings raise hope for the development of (broad-range) anti-enteroviral drugs.

Evaluation of cotton rats as a model for severe acute respiratory syndrome.

Experimental studies were conducted to evaluate two species of cotton rats, Sigmodon hispidus and Sigmodon fulviventer, as a model for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Blood and turbinate wash samples, and lung tissue were collected from each animal at different time points after SARS coronavirus (CoV) infection for determining the growth curve of virus, if any, by the standard infectivity assay in Vero E6 cells. In addition, sections of the lung, liver, spleen, and kidney were taken and used for histology analysis. All animals were observed daily for signs of illness, and in some experiments, animals were weighed on the day when they were sacrificed. The results indicated that the cotton rat species, S. hispidus and S. fulviventer, were not a useful model for either SARS-CoV infection or disease. This observation was supported by the absence of any signs of illness, the failure to consistently demonstrate virus in the blood and tissues, and the absent of any notable histopathology. However, infected animals were capable of producing neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV, suggesting the seroconversion did occur. Further studies are warranted to consider other animal species in efforts to find better animal models for the evaluation of SARS-CoV vaccines and antiviral drugs.

A review of the smallpox vaccine adverse events active surveillance system.

In response to concern about smallpox possibly being used as a biological weapon, the President of the United States launched the National Smallpox Pre-Event Vaccination Program on 13 December 2002. Given safety concerns, identifying potentially serious adverse events (SAEs) was an essential tool of the program. To monitor for SAEs, both enhanced passive surveillance and active surveillance systems were used. The enhanced passive system was built, in part, on the existing Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System; the active system was implemented 24 January 2003. During January 2003-May 2005, the active system detected only 1 SAE in addition to those reported through the enhanced passive system. Furthermore, the active system was not universally used by states. With the enhancements to passive surveillance, the performance of enhanced passive surveillance was comparable to that of active surveillance. However, an active surveillance system may be important when there is no enhanced passive surveillance system available.

Treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome

The best treatment strategy for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is still unknown. Ribavirin and corticosteroids were used extensively during the SARS outbreak. Ribavirin has been criticized for its lack of efficacy. Corticosteroids are effective in lowering the fever and reversing changes in the chest radiograph but have the caveat of encouraging viral replication. The effectiveness of corticosteroids has only been suggested by uncontrolled observations, and the role of these agents in therapy remains to be established by randomized controlled studies. Both ribavirin and corticosteroids have very significant side effects. The lopinavir/ritonavir combination has been shown to reduce the intubation rate and the incidence of adverse clinical outcomes when used with ribavirin. When patients deteriorate clinically despite treatment with ribavirin and corticosteroids, rescue treatment with convalescent plasma and immunoglobulin may be beneficial. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is a sound treatment for SARS patients with respiratory failure if administered with due precaution in the correct environment. Interferons and other novel agents may hold promise as useful anti-SARS therapies in the future. The experience with traditional Chinese medicine is encouraging, and its use as an adjuvant should be further investigated.

COVID-19 in children: Epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis and management.

The new pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected children, including neonates, who mostly comprise of approximately 2% of total confirmed cases. Most children are asymptomatic or have mild disease and much lower mortality compared to adults for yet unknown reasons. Recovery from illness has largely been universal and <2% have severe disease requiring intensive care. Standardised guidelines from initial studies are now available for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Treatment is mostly supportive with no recommendations for any specific drugs so far. As the pandemic evolves, it is expected that more children will be diagnosed and treated with evolving newer regimens. Research should now focus on early diagnosis, better drugs for children, intensive care modalities, and a universal vaccine. New developments will help in better prevention asides from the other precautionary measures already being practiced.

Surviving the surge: Evaluation of early impact of COVID-19 on inpatient pharmacy services at a community teaching hospital

PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has presented novel challenges to healthcare systems; however, an analysis of the impact of the pandemic on inpatient pharmacy services has not yet been conducted. METHODS: Results of an observational assessment of operational and clinical pharmacy services at a community teaching hospital during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic are presented. Service outcomes of the inpatient pharmacy were evaluated from February 1 to April 8, 2020. Outcomes during the weeks preceding the first COVID-19 admission (February 1 to March 11, 2020) and during the pandemic period (March 12 to April 8, 2020) were compared. Evaluated outcomes included daily order verifications, clinical interventions, and usage of relevant medications. An exploratory statistical analysis was conducted using Student’s t test. RESULTS: During the pandemic period, the number of new order verifications decreased from approximately 5,000 orders per day to 3,300 orders per day (P < 0.01), a reduction of 30% during the first 4 weeks of the pandemic compared to the weeks prior. Average daily pharmacokinetic dosing consults were reduced in the pandemic period (from 82 to 67; P < 0.01) compared to the prepandemic period; however, total daily pharmacist interventions did not differ significantly (473 vs 456; P = 0.68). Dispensing of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, enoxaparin, and sedative medications increased substantially during the pandemic period (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). CONCLUSION: The operational and clinical requirements of an inpatient pharmacy department shifted considerably during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacy departments must be adaptable in order to continue to provide effective pharmaceutical care during the pandemic.

Spinal muscular atrophy care in the COVID-19 pandemic era

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in reorganization of healthcare settings affecting the delivery of clinical care to patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). There is a concern that patients with SMA may be at increased risk of manifesting severe symptoms of COVID-19. Currently approved therapies for SMA improve survival and motor function; however, their delivery requires an increased exposure to the health system and a dedicated healthcare team. In this study, we discuss consensus recommendations pertaining to care of SMA patients during the pandemic. We highlight that SMA treatments should not be perceived as elective. Decisions regarding the delay of treatments should be made with consideration of the potential risks of COVID-19 exposure and the risk of that delay. We emphasize the importance of collaborative treatment decisions between the patient, family, and healthcare provider, considering any geographic- or institution-specific policies and precautions for COVID-19.

The Impact of COVID-19 on Tourist Satisfaction with B&B in Zhejiang, China: An Importance-Performance Analysis

After the outbreak of COVID-19 (especially in the stage of tourism recovery), the bed and breakfast (B&B) tourism industry faced big challenges in improving its health strategies. B&Bs are very important for the tourism industry in China and many other countries. However, few studies have studied the impact of B&Bs, under COVID-19, on tourism in China. Our paper is among one of the first studies to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on tourist satisfaction with B&Bs in China. The work/travel restrictions started from 20 January 2020, and work/after travel resumed from 20 February 2020 in Zhejiang, China. Data were collected from 588 tourists (who experienced B&Bs in Zhejiang, China) from a WeChat online survey, from 1 March to 15 March 2020. The current study attempted to fill the gap by studying the changing tourist satisfaction levels with B&Bs before/after COVID-19. Moreover, some suggestions are given to the B&B industry for tourism resumption after COVID-19 by an importance-performance analysis (IPA).

‘Distancers’ and ‘non‐distancers’? The potential social psychological impact of moralizing COVID‐19 mitigating practices on sustained behaviour change

COVID‐19 mitigating practices such as ‘hand‐washing’, ‘social distancing’, or ‘social isolating’ are constructed as ‘moral imperatives’, required to avert harm to oneself and others. Adherence to COVID‐19 mitigating practices is presently high among the general public, and stringent lockdown measures supported by legal and policy intervention have facilitated this. In the coming months, however, as rules are being relaxed and individuals become less strict, and thus, the ambiguity in policy increases, the maintenance of recommended social distancing norms will rely on more informal social interactional processes. We argue that the moralization of these practices, twinned with relaxations of policy, may likely cause interactional tension between those individuals who do vs. those who do not uphold social distancing in the coming months: that is, derogation of those who adhere strictly to COVID‐19 mitigating practices and group polarization between ‘distancers’ and ‘non‐distancers’. In this paper, we explore how and why these processes might come to pass, their impact on an overall societal response to COVID‐19, and the need to factor such processes into decisions regarding how to lift restrictions.

Estimating the COVID-19 infection rate: Anatomy of an inference problem

As a consequence of missing data on tests for infection and imperfect accuracy of tests, reported rates of cumulative population infection by the SARS CoV-2 virus are lower than actual rates of infection. Hence, reported rates of severe illness conditional on infection are higher than actual rates. Understanding the time path of the COVID-19 pandemic has been hampered by the absence of bounds on infection rates that are credible and informative. This paper explains the logical problem of bounding these rates and reports illustrative findings, using data from Illinois, New York, and Italy. We combine the data with assumptions on the infection rate in the untested population and on the accuracy of the tests that appear credible in the current context. We find that the infection rate might be substantially higher than reported. We also find that the infection fatality rate in Illinois, New York, and Italy is substantially lower than reported.

Extensive bullous complication associated with intermittent pneumatic compression.

Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) device is an effective method to prevent deep vein thrombosis. This method has been known to be safe with very low rate of complications compared to medical thromboprophylaxis. Therefore, this modality has been used widely in patients who underwent a hip fracture surgery. We report a patient who developed extensive bullae, a potentially serious skin complication, beneath the leg sleeves during the use of IPC device after hip fracture surgery.

Rheumatologists and Pulmonologists at Temple University weather the COVID-19 storm together.

In recent commentaries from Lancet Rheumatology and The Journal of Rhuematology (1-2) the authors eloquently illustrated the connection between COVID-19 infection, the subsequent cytokine storm (CS) that ensues in a number of patients and the potential efficacy of biologics that Rheumatologists routinely use in their practices. Moreover those biologics were originally investigated by Rheumatologists for the treatment of numerous rheumatic conditions, including macrophage activating syndrome (MAS), a similar form of storm that resembles the one occurring in COVID-19 patients (3).

Respiratory pathogens in respiratory tract illnesses during the first year of life: a birth cohort study.

BACKGROUND Respiratory virus infections are the most important trigger of respiratory illnesses in childhood. Data on the occurrence and the clinical impact of respiratory pathogens in the general population of infants are scarce. Therefore, we described the occurrence and clinical impact of respiratory pathogens in infants with respiratory tract infections during the first year of life. METHODS In a prospective birth cohort study, infants were followed from birth through the first year of life with daily questionnaires about respiratory symptoms. Nose and throat swabs were collected during episodes with respiratory symptoms. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect an extensive panel of respiratory pathogens. RESULTS The parents reported a median of 5 respiratory episodes per infant per year. A total of 668 respiratory samples were collected in 305 infants. One or more respiratory pathogens were detected in 85% of the samples. The most common respiratory pathogens were human rhinovirus (HRV) (73% of the samples), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (11%), and coronavirus (8%). HRV infections were associated with a prolonged period of symptoms compared with RSV (P = 0.03). Infections with RSV were associated with more physician visits than HRV infections (P = 0.06). CONCLUSION We found a high prevalence of respiratory pathogens among infants with parent-reported respiratory illnesses in the first year of life, with HRV being the most prevalent. Although RSV infections seemed to be responsible for the most severe symptoms compared with HRV, the overall burden of disease was highest for HRV infections.

Transcriptome networks identify mechanisms of viral and nonviral asthma exacerbations in children

Respiratory infections are common precursors to asthma exacerbations in children, but molecular immune responses that determine whether and how an infection causes an exacerbation are poorly understood. By using systems-scale network analysis, we identify repertoires of cellular transcriptional pathways that lead to and underlie distinct patterns of asthma exacerbation. Specifically, in both virus-associated and nonviral exacerbations, we demonstrate a set of core exacerbation modules, among which epithelial-associated SMAD3 signaling is upregulated and lymphocyte response pathways are downregulated early in exacerbation, followed by later upregulation of effector pathways including epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, extracellular matrix production, mucus hypersecretion, and eosinophil activation. We show an additional set of multiple inflammatory cell pathways involved in virus-associated exacerbations, in contrast to squamous cell pathways associated with nonviral exacerbations. Our work introduces an in vivo molecular platform to investigate, in a clinical setting, both the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic targets to modify exacerbations.

Clinical pathways for urology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic

The public health emergency caused by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a significant reallocation of health resources with a consequent reorganization of the clinical activities also in several urological centers. A panel of Italian urologists has agreed on a set of recommendations on pathways of pre-, intra- and post-operative care for urological patients undergoing urgent procedures or non-deferrable oncological interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Simplification of the diagnostic and staging pathway has to be prioritized in order to reduce hospital visits and consequently the risk of contagion. In absence of strict uniform regulations that impose the implementation of nasopharyngeal swabs, we recommend that an accurate triage for COVID-19 symptoms be performed both by telephone at home before hospitalization and at the time of hospitalization. We recommend that during hospital stay patients should be provided with as many instructions as possible to facilitate their return to, and stay at, home. Patients should be discharged under stable good conditions in order to minimize the risk of readmission. It is advisable to reduce or reschedule post-discharge controls and implement an adequate system of communication for telemonitoring discharged patients.

Circulating Tumour Cells in Patients with Malignant Lung Tumors Undergoing Radio-frequency Ablation.

BACKGROUND/AIM Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an increasingly utilised technique in patients with surgically-untreatable lesions. The effect of this therapy on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is unknown. As far as we are aware of, this is the first study to evaluate the effects of RFA on CTCs in patients with malignant lung tumors immediately post-treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS Nine patients with primary or metastatic lung tumors underwent RFA therapy from June to November 2013. Blood samples were taken before and after RFA, and filtered through the ScreenCell CTC capture device. RESULTS A general increase in CTCs in 7 out of the 9 cases was found, the largest increases were seen in the metastatic group. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that the manipulation and ablative procedure of lung tumors leads to immediate dissemination of tumor cells, the effects of which are unknown and require further investigation.

A VLP vaccine for epidemic Chikungunya virus protects non-human primates against infection

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has infected millions of people in Africa, Europe, and Asia1,2 since its re-emergence in Kenya in 2004. The severity of disease and spread of this epidemic virus present a serious public health threat in the absence of vaccines or anti-viral therapies. Here, we describe a novel vaccine that protects against emerging CHIKV infection of non-human primates (NHP). We show that selective expression of viral structural proteins gives rise to virus-like particles (VLPs) in vitro that resemble replication-competent alphaviruses. Immunization with these VLPs elicited neutralizing antibodies against envelope proteins from different CHIKV strains. Monkeys immunized with VLPs produced high titer neutralizing antibodies that protected against viremia after high dose challenge. We transferred these antibodies into immunodeficient mice, where they protected against subsequent lethal CHIKV challenge, establishing a humoral mechanism of protection. Immunization with alphavirus VLP vaccines represents a strategy to contain the spread of CHIKV and related pathogenic viruses in humans.

A novel diagnostic approach to detecting porcine epidemic diarrhea virus: The lateral immunochromatography assay

Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes acute diarrhea and dehydration in sucking piglets and has a high mortality rate. An immunochromatography (IC) assay, known as a lateral flow test, is a simple device intended to detect the presence of target pathogens. Here, we developed an IC assay that detected PEDV antigens with 96.0% (218/227) sensitivity and 98.5% (262/266) specificity when compared with real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR using FAM-labeled probes based on sequences from nucleocapsid genes. The detection limits of the real-time RT-PCR and IC assays were 1×102 and 1×103 copies, respectively. The IC assay developed herein did not detect non-specific reactions with other viral or bacterial pathogens, and the assay could be stored at 4°C or room temperature for 15 months without affecting its efficacy. Thus, the IC assay may result in improved PED detection and control on farms, and is a viable alternative to current diagnostic tools for PEDV.

Tuberculosis in public ground transport - is there enough evidence to justify contact tracing?

Travel in public transport, especially in confined spaces, provides an opportunity for the transmission of tuberculosis (TB). In air travel, tracing of passengers to control the further spread of a pathogen is a more or less established approach in infectious disease control in many industrialized countries; however, literature reviews on the risk of TB transmission during public ground travel do not show robust evidence. On short trips, contact tracing (CT) of passengers may be unfeasible since passenger data are generally not collected. In long-distance ground travel, passenger data may not be collected routinely; incomplete data and limited or delayed access to passenger details may be further obstacles. The logistic hurdles and limited evidence suggest that CT in public ground transportation should not be a priority of TB control. However, under specific circumstances, CT in public ground transport might be considered on a case-by-case basis after an evidence-based risk assessment.

A large hepatic cyst with obstructive jaundice successfully treated with single-incision laparoscopic deroofing.

We herein present a case of hepatic cysts causing obstructive jaundice that was treated with single-incision laparoscopic deroofing. A 72-year-old female patient was referred to hospital due to a large hepatic cyst that compressed the intrahepatic bile ducts. The patient was scheduled to undergo single-incision laparoscopic deroofing. The EZ ACCESS(TM) oval type (Hakko Co. Ltd.) was placed at the umbilicus using a 25-mm incision with two 5-mm trocars. An additional 12-mm port was placed at the left epigastric region. We unroofed and excised the cyst wall using a vessel sealing system in liver segment 4. After surgery, the patient was found to be asymptomatic. The unroofed cysts were completely diminished. Notably, the remnant liver had fairly regenerated. The estimated regeneration volume of the normal liver was 153 cm(3). To prevent surgical complications, clinicians should perform adequate management and use of devices. To prevent postoperative recurrence of cysts, performing complete deroofing is essential. Single-incision laparoscopic deroofing contributes to improving the quality of life of patients and should be considered a standard treatment.

Pycnogenol, a procyanidin-rich extract from French maritime pine, inhibits intracellular replication of HIV-1 as well as its binding to host cells.

A procyanidin-rich extract from French maritime pine, Pycnogenol(R) (PYC), is known as an antioxidant that exerts a variety of physiological activities and is widely used in human beings. We report here that PYC inhibits not only human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) binding to host cells, but also its replication after entry in susceptible cells in vitro. Prominent biochemical alterations induced by PYC were the elevated expression of an intracellular antioxidant protein, manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), and the inhibition of phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein. Interestingly, ectopic expression of Mn-SOD inhibited HIV-1 replication as well. Inhibition of HIV-1 replication associated with induced expression of Mn-SOD in cells treated with PYC suggests the potential of this natural antioxidant inducer as a new anti-HIV-1 agent.

Bone Marrow Transplantation

Hematopoietic transplantation is increasingly being used as treatment for a variety of severe diseases. Data from International Registries indicate that more than 25,000 transplants are performed every year in Europe, and a similar number in the United States (US) (Copelan 2006; Gratwohl et al. 2007). The objectives of this procedure are: (1) to replace hematopoiesis affected by a severe and irreversible disorder, (2) to rescue the patient from intense marrow toxicity induced by high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation, and (3) to use a fraction of cells contained in the graft as anti-tumor immunotherapy. Of note, one or more of these objectives may be pursued in a particular situation; for example, in a patient with acute leukemia, transplantation aims to replace the neoplastic hematopoiesis by administering high-dose cytotoxic therapy and taking advantage of the graft-versus-leukemia effect of donor T-lymphocytes from the graft. In contrast, in aplastic anemia the only goal of the procedure is to restore an adequate hematopoiesis.

Integration of care for HIV and opioid use disorder: a systematic review of interventions in clinical and community-based settings.

OBJECTIVE We sought to identify optimal strategies for integrating HIV- and opioid use disorder-(OUD) screening and treatment in diverse settings. DESIGN Systematic review. METHODS We searched Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO and pre-identified websites. Studies were included if they were published in English on or after 2002 through May 2017, and evaluated interventions that integrated, at an organizational level, screening and/or treatment for HIV and OUD in any care setting in any country. RESULTS Twenty-nine articles met criteria for inclusion, including 23 unique studies: six took place in HIV care settings, 12 in opioid treatment settings, and five elsewhere. Eight involved screening strategies, 22 involved treatment strategies, and seven involved strategies that encompassed screening and treatment. Randomized controlled studies demonstrated low to moderate risk of bias and observational studies demonstrated fair to good quality. Studies in HIV care settings (n = 6) identified HIV- and OUD-related clinical benefits with the use of buprenorphine/naloxone for OUD. No studies in HIV care settings focused on screening for OUD. Studies in opioid treatment settings (n = 12) identified improving HIV screening uptake and clinical benefits with antiretroviral therapy when provided on-site. Counseling intensity for OUD medication adherence or HIV-related risk reduction was not associated with clinical benefits. CONCLUSION Screening for HIV can be effectively delivered in opioid treatment settings, yet there is a need to identify optimal OUD screening strategies in HIV care settings. Strategies integrating the provision of medications for HIV and for OUD should be expanded and should not be contingent on resources available for behavioral interventions. REGISTRATION A protocol for record eligibility was developed a priori and was registered in the PROSPERO database of systematic reviews (registration number CRD42017069314).

Lies, Gosh Darn Lies, and Not Enough Good Statistics: Why Epidemic Model Parameter Estimation Fails

An opportunity exists in exploring epidemic modeling as a novel way to determine physiological and demic parameters for genetic association studies on a population/environmental (quasi) epidemiological study level. First, the spread of SARS-COV-2 has produced population specific lineages; second, epidemic spread model parameters are tied directly to these physiological and demic rates (e. g. incubation time, recovery time, transmission rate); and third, these parameters may serve as novel phenotypes to associate with region-specific genetic mutations as well as demic characteristics (e. g. age structure, cultural observance of personal space, crowdedness). Therefore, we sought to understand whether the parameters of epidemic models could be determined from the trajectory of infections, recovery, and hospitalizations prior to peak, and also to evaluate the quality and comparability of data between jurisdictions reporting their statistics necessary for the analysis of model parameters across populations. We found that, analytically, the pre-peak growth of an epidemic is limited by a subset of the model variates, and that the rate limiting variables are dominated by the expanding eigenmode of their equations. The variates quickly converge to the ratio of eigenvector components of the positive growth rate, which determines the doubling time. There are 9 parameters and 4 independent components in the eigenmode, leaving 5 undetermined parameters. Those parameters can be strikingly population dependent, and can have significant impact on estimates of hospital loads downstream. Without a sound framework, measurements of infection rates and other parameters are highly corrupted by uneven testing rates to uneven counting and reporting of relevant values. From the standpoint of phenotype parameters, this means that structured experiments must be performed to estimate these parameters in order to perform genetic association studies, or to construct viable models that accurately predict critical quantities such as hospitalization loads.

Vitamin D deficiency as risk factor for severe COVID-19: a convergence of two pandemics

Importance: Vitamin D deficiency increases the incidence of respiratory virus infections. More than 1 billion people worldwide are vitamin D deficient. If vitamin D deficiency is associated to incidence or severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a global call could be made for vitamin D supplementation to mitigate the pandemic. Objective: to determine if lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are correlated to the risk for COVID-19 and its severity as measured by CT Design: single-center observational study Setting: AZ Delta general hospital Participants: 186 consecutive patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized for COVID-19 from March 1, 2020 to April 7, 2020 Main outcome and measures: comparative analysis of 25(OH)D levels in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at various radiological stages and a season/age/sex-matched diseased control population Results: we report on 186 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients requiring hospitalization for severe COVID-19: 109 males (median age 68 years, IQR 53-79 years) and 77 females (median age 71 years, IQR 65-74 years). At admission patients were screened by CT to determine temporal changes of COVID-19 lung disease and classified as stage 1 (ground glass opacities), 2 (crazy paving pattern) and 3 (consolidation). At intake, 25(OH)D levels were measured and compared to a season-matched population of 2717 diseased controls, consisting of 999 males (median age 69 years, IQR 53-81 years) and 1718 females (median age 68 years, IQR 43-83 years). Male and female COVID-19 patients combined showed lower median 25(OH)D than controls (18.6 ng/mL, IQR 12.6-25.3, versus 21.5 ng/mL, IQR 13.9-30.8; P=0.0016) and a higher fraction of vitamin D deficiency (58.6% versus 45.2%, P=0.0005). A strong sexual dimorphism was found: female patients had comparable vitamin D status as control females. Male COVID-19 patients, however, showed markedly higher percentage of vitamin D deficiency than controls (67.0% versus 49.2%, P=0.0006) and this effect was more pronounced with advanced radiological stage ranging from 55.2% in stage 1 to 74% in stage 3. Conclusions and relevance: vitamin D deficiency is a possible risk factor for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in males. Vitamin D supplementation might be an inexpensive, accessible and safe mitigation for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Spontaneous variability of pre-dialysis concentrations of uremic toxins over time in stable hemodialysis patients.

BACKGROUND AND AIM Numerous outcome studies and interventional trials in hemodialysis (HD) patients are based on uremic toxin concentrations determined at one single or a limited number of time points. The reliability of these studies however entirely depends on how representative these cross-sectional concentrations are. We therefore investigated the variability of predialysis concentrations of uremic toxins over time. METHODS Prospectively collected predialysis serum samples of the midweek session of week 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 16 were analyzed for a panel of uremic toxins in stable chronic HD patients (N = 18) while maintaining dialyzer type and dialysis mode during the study period. RESULTS Concentrations of the analyzed uremic toxins varied substantially between individuals, but also within stable HD patients (intra-patient variability). For urea, creatinine, beta-2-microglobulin, and some protein-bound uremic toxins, Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was higher than 0.7. However, for phosphorus, uric acid, symmetric and asymmetric dimethylarginine, and the protein-bound toxins hippuric acid and indoxyl sulfate, ICC values were below 0.7, implying a concentration variability within the individual patient even exceeding 65% of the observed inter-patient variability. CONCLUSION Intra-patient variability may affect the interpretation of the association between a single concentration of certain uremic toxins and outcomes. When performing future outcome and interventional studies with uremic toxins other than described here, one should quantify their intra-patient variability and take into account that for solutes with a large intra-patient variability associations could be missed.

Antiapoptotic activity of the cardiovirus leader protein, a viral "security" protein.

Apoptosis is a common antiviral defensive mechanism that potentially limits viral reproduction and spread. Many viruses possess apoptosis-suppressing tools. Here, we show that the productive infection of HeLa cells with encephalomyocarditis virus (a cardiovirus) was not accompanied by full-fledged apoptosis (although the activation of caspases was detected late in infection) but rather elicited a strong antiapoptotic state, as evidenced by the resistance of infected cells to viral and nonviral apoptosis inducers. The development of the antiapoptotic state appeared to depend on a function(s) of the viral leader (L) protein, since its mutational inactivation resulted in the efflux of cytochrome c from mitochondria, the early activation of caspases, and the appearance of morphological and biochemical signs of apoptosis in a significant proportion of infected cells. Infection with both wild-type and L-deficient viruses induced the fragmentation of mitochondria, which in the former case was not accompanied with cytochrome c efflux. Although the exact nature of the antiapoptotic function(s) of cardioviruses remains obscure, our results suggested that it includes previously undescribed mechanisms operating upstream and possibly downstream of the mitochondrial level, and that L is involved in the control of these mechanisms. We propose that cardiovirus L belongs to a class of viral proteins, dubbed here security proteins, whose roles consist solely, or largely, in counteracting host antidefenses. Unrelated L proteins of other picornaviruses as well as their highly variable 2A proteins also may be security proteins. These proteins appear to be independent acquisitions in the evolution of picornaviruses, implying multiple cases of functional (though not structural) convergence.

Apnea Testing for the Determination of Brain Death: A Systematic Scoping Review

Apnea is one of the three cardinal findings in brain death (BD). Apnea testing (AT) is physiologically and practically complex. We sought to review described modifications of AT, safety and complication rates, monitoring techniques, performance of AT on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and other relevant considerations regarding AT. We conducted a systematic scoping review to answer these questions by searching the literature on AT in English language available in PubMed or EMBASE since 1980. Pediatric or animal studies were excluded. A total of 87 articles matched our inclusion criteria and were qualitatively synthesized in this review. A large body of the literature on AT since its inception addresses a variety of modifications, monitoring techniques, complication rates, ways to perform AT on ECMO, and other considerations such as variability in protocols, lack of uniform awareness, and legal considerations. Only some modifications are widely used, especially methods to maintain oxygenation, and most are not standardized or endorsed by brain death guidelines. Future updates to AT protocols and strive for unification of such protocols are desirable. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1007/s12028-020-01015-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Myeloablation-associated deletion of ORF4 in a human coronavirus 229E infection

We describe metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of a human coronavirus 229E from a patient with AML and persistent upper respiratory symptoms, who underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). mNGS revealed a 548-nucleotide deletion, which comprised the near entirety of the ORF4 gene, and no minor allele variants were detected to suggest a mixed infection. As part of her pre-HCT conditioning regimen, the patient received myeloablative treatment with cyclophosphamide and 12 Gy total body irradiation. Iterative sequencing and RT-PCR confirmation of four respiratory samples over the 4-week peritransplant period revealed that the pre-conditioning strain contained an intact ORF4 gene, while the deletion strain appeared just after conditioning and persisted over a 2.5-week period. This sequence represents one of the largest genomic deletions detected in a human RNA virus and describes large-scale viral mutation associated with myeloablation for HCT.

Association between serum levels of C-reactive protein and personality traits in women.

BACKGROUND While low-grade inflammation has consistently been observed in subjects with depression, studies on the possible relationship between inflammation and other aspects of brain function are as yet sparse. In this study, we aimed to investigate the possible association between serum levels of the inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP) and personality traits. METHODS In this study, serum levels of high-sensitivity CRP were determined by ELISA in a population of 270 42-year-old women recruited from the population registry who had been assessed using the Temperament and Character Inventory. Self-reported previous or ongoing depression was also recorded. Unpaired two-tailed t-tests were used for comparison between two groups and correlations were evaluated by the calculation of Pearson's r-coefficient. RESULTS The temperament trait harm avoidance was positively (r = 0.227, p < 0.05) and the character trait self-directedness was negatively (r = -0.261, p < 0.01) associated with serum levels of CRP (p-values corrected for multiple comparisons). The correlations between the personality traits and CRP were observed also after exclusion of subjects reporting ongoing depression (n = 26). Whereas women reporting ongoing depression showed significantly increased levels of CRP as compared to non-depressed women (n = 155), women reporting a history of depression displayed no significant difference in CRP levels as compared to women that reported that they had never been depressed. CONCLUSION Serum levels of CRP in women was found to be associated with the personality traits harm avoidance and self-directedness. In addition, moderately elevated levels may be a state dependent marker of depression.

Standardized Preparation for Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Pigs

The intestine of pigs harbors a mass of microorganisms which are essential for intestinal homeostasis and host health. Intestinal microbial disorders induce enteric inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, thereby causing adverse effects on the growth and health of pigs. In the human medicine, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which engrafts the fecal microbiota from a healthy donor into a patient recipient, has shown efficacy in intestinal microbiota restoration. In addition, it has been used widely in therapy for human gastrointestinal diseases, including Clostridium difficile infection, inflammatory bowel diseases, and irritable bowel syndrome. Given that pigs share many similarities with humans, in terms of anatomy, nutritional physiology, and intestinal microbial compositions, FMT may also be used to restore the normal intestinal microbiota of pigs. However, feasible procedures for performing FMT in pigs remains unclear. Here, we summarize a standardized preparation for FMT in pigs by combining the standard methodology for human FMT with pig production. The key issues include the donor selection, fecal material preparation, fecal material transfer, stool bank establishment, and the safety for porcine FMT. Optimal donors should be selected to ensure the efficacy of porcine FMT and reduce the risks of transmitting infectious diseases to recipients during FMT. Preparing for fresh fecal material is highly recommended. Alternatively, frozen fecal suspension can also be prepared as an optimal choice because it is convenient and has similar efficacy. Oral administration of fecal suspension could be an optimal method for porcine fecal material transfer. Furthermore, the dilution ratio of fecal materials and the frequency of fecal material transfer could be adjusted according to practical situations in the pig industry. To meet the potential large-scale requirement in the pig industry, it is important to establish a stool bank to make porcine FMT readily available. Future studies should also focus on providing more robust safety data on FMT to improve the safety and tolerability of the recipient pigs. This standardized preparation for porcine FMT can facilitate the development of microbial targeted therapies and improve the intestinal health of pigs.

Stop playing with data: there is no sound evidence that Bacille Calmette-Guérin may avoid SARS-CoV-2 infection (for now)

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, a possible explanation for the high heterogeneity of infection/mortality rates across involved countries was hinted in the prevalence of tuberculosis vaccination with Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG). A systematic review was therefore performed on May 2, 2020. A total of 13 articles were ultimately retrieved, 12 of them as preprint papers. All articles were ecological studies of low quality. Most of them did not include main confounding factors (i.e. demographic of the assessed countries, share of peo- ple residing in urban settings, etc.), and simply assessed the differences among incidence/mortality of COVID-19 with vaccination rates or by having vs. having not any vaccination policy for BCG. Even though all studies shared the very same information sources (i.e. international registries for BCG vaccination rates and open source data for COVID-19 epidemics), results were conflicting, with later studies apparently denying any true correlation between COVID-19 occurrence and BCG vaccination rates and/or policies. As a consequence, there is no sound evidence to recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19.

Fighting Against COVID‐19 through Government Initiatives and Collaborative Governance: Taiwan Experience

Taiwan is situated less than 200 km from the first Covid‐19 outbreak state, China, and has millions of international visitors yearly. Taiwan's collective efforts to block and eliminate the invisible enemy (Covid‐19) from the island, have resulted in relatively low infection and death numbers, and were hailed as a successful anomaly amid the global pandemic. In this review, I pinpoint some background on the systems and organizations that helped Taiwan streamline a task force (Command Center) in a timely manner to launch related initiatives, mobilize the public, and engage private resources to implement the strategies and policies which were further enhanced by collaborative behaviors and volunteers. Also, even subject to similar threatening conditions such as cruise ship stopover and numerous foreign immigrant workers, there were no outbreaks of community infection in Taiwan similar to Singapore, Japan, etc. Taiwan's successful measures offer good example for future comparative studies.

Monitoring acute phase proteins in retrovirus infected cats undergoing feline interferon‐ω therapy

OBJECTIVES: Recombinant feline interferon‐ω therapy is an immunomodulator currently used in the treatment of different retroviral diseases including feline immune deficiency virus and feline leukaemia virus. Although its mechanism of action remains unclear, this drug appears to potentiate the innate response. Acute phase proteins are one of the key components of innate immunity and studies describing their use as a monitoring tool for the immune system in animals undergoing interferon‐ω therapy are lacking. This study aimed to determine whether interferon‐ω therapy influences acute phase protein concentrations namely serum amyloid‐A, α‐1‐glycoprotein and C‐reactive protein. METHODS: A single‐arm study was performed using 16 cats, living in an animal shelter, naturally infected with retroviruses and subjected to the interferon‐ω therapy licensed protocol. Samples were collected before (D0), during (D10 and D30) and after therapy (D65). Serum amyloid‐A and C‐reactive protein were measured by specific enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay kits and α‐1‐glycoprotein by single radial immunodiffusion. RESULTS: All the acute phase proteins significantly increased in cats undergoing interferon‐ω therapy (D0/D65: P<0·05) CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Acute phase proteins appear to be reasonable predictors of innate‐immune stimulation and may be useful in the individual monitoring of naturally retroviral infected cats undergoing interferon‐ω therapy.

Love in the Time of COVID-19: Sexual Function and Quality of Life Analysis During the Social Distancing Measures in a Group of Italian Reproductive-Age Women

BACKGROUND: The beginning of 2020 was characterized by the COVID-19 pandemic. The world governments have adopted restrictive measures to reduce the spread of infection. These measures could affect the sexual function and quality of life of women living with their partner. AIM: The aim is to assess the impact of the social distancing measures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual function and quality of life of noninfected reproductive-age women, living with their sexual partner. METHODS: Observational analysis on sexually active women, living with their partner, and without COVID-19 infection was performed. The population previously answered FSFI, FSDS, and SF-36 questionnaires. 4 weeks after the introduction of the restrictive measures, these women were invited to complete the same questionnaires by e-mail for an evaluation during the COVID-19 outbreak. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoint was the assessment of the women's sex function change during the social restriction period, by analyzing the FSFI and FSDS questionnaires. The secondary endpoint was the evaluation of the impact on the quality of life calculated by the SF-36 questionnaire. RESULTS: 89 patients were considered. The median age was 39 (28–50) years. Mean sexual intercourses/month decreased from 6.3 ± 1.9 to 2.3 ± 1.8, mean difference: −3.9 ± 1.2. FSFI decreased significantly (29.2 ± 4.2 vs 19.2 ± 3.3, mean difference: −9.7 ± 2.6) and FSDS increased significantly (9.3 ± 5.5 vs 20.1 ± 5.2, mean difference: 10.8 ± 3.4). The SF-36 showed a significant change from 82.2 ± 10.2 to 64.2 ± 11.8 4 weeks after the introduction of the restrictive measures; mean difference: −17.8 ± 6.7. The univariable analysis identified working outside the home, university educational level, and parity ≥1 as predictive factors of lower FSFI. In multivariable analysis, working outside the home and combination of working outside the home + university educational level + parity ≥1 were the independent factors of a lower FSFI. CLINICAL IMPLICATION: The negative impact of the COVID-19 epidemic period on sexual function and quality of life in women shows how acute stress might affect the psychological state. Thus, psychological or sexual support could be useful. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: To our knowledge, this study is the first that analyzes the change in sexual activity in women during the COVID-19 outbreak period. The limitations were the low number of the analyzed participants, psychological tests were not included, and no data were collected on masturbation, self-heroism, solitary, and nonpenetrative sex. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 epidemic and the restrictive social distancing measures have negatively influenced the sexual function and quality of life in not-infected reproductive-age women who live with their sexual partners.

A novel approach for addressing diseases not yielding to effective vaccination? Immunization by replication-competent controlled virus.

Vaccination involves inoculation of a subject with a disabled disease-causing microbe or parts thereof. While vaccination has been highly successful, we still lack sufficiently effective vaccines for important infectious diseases. We propose that a more complete immune response than that elicited from a vaccine may be obtained from immunization with a disease-causing virus modified to subject replication-essential genes to the control of a gene switch activated by non-lethal heat in the presence of a drug-like compound. Upon inoculation, strictly localized replication of the virus would be triggered by a heat dose administered to the inoculation site. Activated virus would transiently replicate with an efficiency approaching that of the disease-causing virus and express all viral antigens. It may also vector heterologous antigens or control co-infecting microbes.

The adverse effect of COVID pandemic on the care of patients with kidney diseases in India

INTRODUCTION: The Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the care of patients with non-communicable diseases, including those suffering from kidney-related ailments. Many parts of the world, including India, adopted lockdown to curb community transmission of disease. The lockdown affected transportation, access to healthcare facilities, availability of medicines, and consumables as well as out and inpatient services. We aimed to analyze the effect of lockdown imposed due to COVID-19 pandemic on the care of patients with kidney diseases in India. METHODS: We surveyed 19 major hospitals (8 in public and 11 in private sector) to determine the effect of lockdown on the care of patients with kidney disease, including those on dialysis after the first 3 weeks of lockdown. RESULTS: The total number of dialysis patients in these centres came down from 2517 to 2404. About 710(28.2%) of patients missed one or more dialysis sessions, 69 (2.74%) required emergency dialysis sessions, 104 (4.13%) stopped reporting for dialysis, and 9 (0.36%) were confirmed to have died. Outpatient attendance in the surveyed hospital came down by 92.3%, and inpatient service reduced by 61%. Tele-consultation was started but accessed by only a small number of patients. CONCLUSION: Lack of preparedness before lockdown resulted in an interruption in health care services and posed an immediate adverse effect on the outcome of dialysis and kidney disease patients in India. The long-term impact on the health of patients with less severe forms of kidney disease remains unknown.

A Bottom-Up Approach for Pig Skeleton Extraction Using RGB Data

Animal behavior analysis is a crucial task for the industrial farming. In an indoor farm setting, extracting Key joints of animals is essential for tracking the animal for a longer period of time. In this paper, we proposed a deep network that exploits transfer learning to train the network for the pig skeleton extraction in an end to end fashion. The backbone of the architecture is based on an hourglass stacked dense-net. In order to train the network, keyframes are selected from the test data using K-mean sampler. In total, 9 Keypoints are annotated that gives a brief detailed behavior analysis in the farm setting. Extensive experiments are conducted and the quantitative results show that the network has the potential of increasing the tracking performance by a substantial margin.

Applications of digital technology in COVID-19 pandemic planning and response

With high transmissibility and no effective vaccine or therapy, COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. Government-coordinated efforts across the globe have focused on containment and mitigation, with varying degrees of success. Countries that have maintained low COVID-19 per-capita mortality rates appear to share strategies that include early surveillance, testing, contact tracing, and strict quarantine. The scale of coordination and data management required for effective implementation of these strategies has—in most successful countries—relied on adopting digital technology and integrating it into policy and health care. This Viewpoint provides a framework for the application of digital technologies in pandemic management and response, highlighting ways in which successful countries have adopted these technologies for pandemic planning, surveillance, testing, contact tracing, quarantine, and health care.

Management and Treatment of COVID-19: The Chinese Experience

With more than 1,800,000 cases and 110,000 deaths globally, COVID-19 is one of worst infectious disease outbreaks in history. This paper provides a critical review of the available evidence regarding the lessons learned from the Chinese experience with COVID-19 prevention and management. The steps that have led to a near disappearance of new cases in China included rapid sequencing of the virus to establish testing kits, which allowed tracking of infected persons in and out of Wuhan. In addition, aggressive quarantine measures included the complete isolation of Wuhan and then later Hubei Province and the rest of the country, as well as closure of all schools and nonessential businesses. Other measures included the rapid construction of two new hospitals and the establishment of "Fangcang" shelter hospitals. In the absence of a vaccine, the management of COVID-19 included antivirals, high-flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, interferons, intravenous immunoglobulin, and convalescent plasma infusions. These measures appeared to provide only moderate success. Although some measures have been supported by weak descriptive data, their effectiveness is still unclear pending well controlled clinical trials. In the end, it was the enforcement of drastic quarantine measures that stopped SARS-CoV-2 from spreading. The earlier the implementation, the less likely resources will be depleted. The most critical factors in stopping a pandemic are early recognition of infected individuals, carriers, and contacts and early implementation of quarantine measures with an organised, proactive, and unified strategy at a national level. Delays result in significantly higher death tolls.

Opposite Modulatory Effects of Crataegus aronia Aqueous Extract on Platelet Aggregation in Rats.

OBJECTIVES To reveal the mechanisms behind the dual effects of Crataegus aronia (C. aronia) aqueous extract on platelet aggregation by focusing on function, regulation, expression, and signaling of platelets P2Y12 receptors. METHODS Adult male Wistar rats (120 ± 10 g) were classified as control received the vehicle, C. aronia (200 mg/kg), and C. aronia (2,000 mg/kg)-treated rats. After treatments for consecutive 7 days, hematological and molecular experiments were conducted to detect alterations in platelet aggregation, thromboxane B2 (THXB2) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) content; protein levels of P2Y12, p-Akt, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), phosphorylated vasodilator-stimulated-phosphoprotein (p-VASP), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), P-selectin, and etc. in platelets were determined by Western blot; mRNA expressions of P2Y12 and some inflammatory markers were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS At a concentration of 200 mg/kg, C. aronia inhibited platelet aggregation through multiple interconnected mechanisms including downregulation P2Y12 synthesis and expression, stimulating intracellular cAMP levels and protein levels of p-VASP, inhibiting platelets THXB2 release and protein levels of P-selectin. Also, it inhibited platelets level of ROS and of NF-κB, a major signaling pathway that stimulates the expression of P2Y12 and THXA2 synthesis. Opposite findings were seen in platelets of rats received C. aronia at a concentration of 2,000 mg/kg. Interestingly, co-administration of N-acetylcysteine prevented all hematological and molecular alterations exerted by the high dose of the extract and inhibited platelet aggregation. CONCLUSION Oral administration of C. aronia at low dose inhibits platelet aggregation by reducing THXB2 release, expression of P-selectin and activating cAMP and Akt signaling through two major mechanisms including downregulation of P2Y12 and inhibition of ROS-induced activation of NF-κB, an effect that is observed to be in the opposite direction with its high dose.

Viral hijacking of the host ubiquitin system to evade interferon responses

The post-translational attachment of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifiers (ULMs) to proteins regulates many cellular processes including the generation of innate and adaptive immune responses to pathogens. Vice versa, pathogens counteract immune defense by inhibiting or redirecting the ubiquitination machinery of the host. A common immune evasion strategy is for viruses to target host immunoproteins for proteasomal or lysosomal degradation by employing viral or host ubiquitin ligases. By degrading key host adaptor and signaling molecules, viruses thus disable multiple immune response pathways including the production of and response to interferons as well as other innate host defense mechanisms. Recent work further revealed that viruses inhibit the ligation of ubiquitin or ULMs or remove ubiquitin from host cell proteins. Thus, viruses succeed in either stabilizing negative regulators of innate immune signaling or thwart host cell proteins that are activated by ubiquitin or ULM-modification.

Evidence of human bocavirus circulating in children and adults, Cleveland, Ohio

Abstract Background Viral respiratory illness is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The human bocavirus (HBoV) is a recently recognized parvovirus isolated from human respiratory secretions. Objectives To define the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics in adult and pediatric patients with evidence of HBoV. Study design From October 2005 through October 2006, we screened respiratory samples from children and adults negative for common respiratory pathogens for HBoV by PCR. Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from medical records of HBoV positive individuals. Results Of 2075 samples screened, 1826 (88.0%) represented distinct respiratory events: 1539 (84.3%) were pediatric (<18 years), and 273 (15.0%) adult (≥18 years). Forty (2.2%) patients had HBoV: 36 (2.3%) children and 4 (1.5%) adults. HBoV positive children had history of prematurity (31.3%) and cardiac disease (18.8%). Adults had underlying pulmonary (100%) and cardiac (50%) disease. Twenty-seven children (84.4%) were hospitalized; 9 (28.1%) required intensive care. All adults were hospitalized; none required intensive care. Nosocomial acquisition likely occurred in 3 patients. Conclusions HBoV circulates in Cleveland, OH, in children and adults with similar frequencies, and can warrant hospitalization and intensive care. Further study would clarify our understanding of this newly recognized human pathogen.

Transnational Quarantine Rhetorics: Public Mobilization in SARS and in H1N1 Flu

This essay examines how Chinese governments, local communities, and overseas Chinese in North America responded to the perceived health risks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 flu through the use of public and participatory rhetoric about risk and quarantines. Focusing on modes of security and quarantine practices, I examine how globalization and the social crises surrounding SARS and H1N1 flu operated to regulate differently certain bodies and areas. I identify three types of quarantines (mandatory, voluntary, and coerced) and conduct a transnational comparative analysis to investigate the relationships among quarantines, rhetoric, and public communication. I argue that health authorities must openly acknowledge the legitimacy of public input and actively seek public support regarding health crises. Only by collaborating with concerned communities and citizens and by providing careful guidance for public participation can health institutions ensure the efficacy of quarantine orders during emerging epidemics.

Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever: Current Scenario in India

India is considered as a hot spot for emerging infectious diseases. In the recent past many infectious diseases of emerging and re-emerging nature have entered this subcontinent and affected a large number of populations. A few examples are Nipah, Avian influenza, Pandemic influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus and Chikungunya virus. These diseases have not only affected human and animal health but also economy of the country on a very large scale. During December 2010, National Institute of Virology, Pune detected Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus specific IgG antibodies in livestock serum samples from Gujarat and Rajasthan states. Subsequently, during January 2011 Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus was confirmed in a nosocomial outbreak, in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India. Retrospective investigation of suspected human samples confirmed that the virus was present in Gujarat state, earlier to this outbreak. This disease has a case fatality rate ranging from 5 to 80 %. Earlier presence of hemagglutination inhibition antibodies have been detected in animal sera from Jammu and Kashmir, the western border districts, southern regions and Maharashtra state of India. The evidences of virus activity and antibodies were observed during and after the outbreak in human beings, ticks and domestic animals (buffalo, cattle, goat and sheep) from Gujarat State of India. During the year 2012, this virus was again reported in human beings and animals. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all the four isolates of 2011, as well as the S segment from specimen of 2010 and 2012 were highly conserved and clustered together in the Asian/Middle East genotype IV. The S segment of South-Asia 2 type was closest to a Tajikistan strain TADJ/HU8966 of 1990. The present scenario in India suggests the need to look seriously into various important aspects of this zoonotic disease, which includes diagnosis, intervention, patient management, control of laboratory acquired and nosocomial infection, tick control, livestock survey and this, should be done in priority before it further spreads to other states. Being a high risk group pathogen, diagnosis is a major concern in India where only a few Biosafety level 3 laboratories exist and it needs to be addressed immediately before this disease becomes endemic in India.

Varying Presentations and Favourable Outcomes of COVID-19 Infection in Children and Young Adults with Sickle Cell Disease: An Additional Case Series with Comparisons to Published Cases.

Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are theoretically at greater risk for serious illness from COVID 19 due to the underlying pathophysiology of chronic inflammation with an increased risk of thrombosis, especially at the time of a vaso-occlusive event (1). Individuals living with SCD are also considered to be immunocompromised due to autoinfarction of their spleen or surgical splenectomy, often as a result of red cell splenic sequestration (2). In addition, patients with SCD often have comorbidities and secondary organ dysfunction that can put them at risk of significant morbidity and or mortality from the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and its subsequent disease COVID-19.

A systematic review of decision aids that facilitate elements of shared decision-making in chronic illnesses: a review protocol.

BACKGROUND Shared decision-making (SDM) is a patient-centred approach in which clinicians and patients work side-by-side to decide together on the best course of action for each patient's particular situation. Six key elements of SDM can be distinguished: situation diagnosis, choice awareness, option clarification, discussion of harms and benefits, deliberation of patient preferences and making the decision. Decision aids (DAs) are tools that facilitate SDM. The impact of DAs for chronic illnesses on SDM, clinical and patient reported outcomes remains uncertain. METHODS We will perform a systematic review aiming to describe (a) which SDM elements are incorporated in DAs for adult patients with chronic conditions and (b) the effects of DA use on SDM, clinical and patient reported outcomes. This manuscript reports on the protocol for this systematic review. The following databases will be searched for relevant articles: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL and PsycINFO, from their inception to October 2016. We will ascertain ongoing research by querying experts and searching trial registries. To enhance feasibility, we will limit the review to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including patients with chronic cardiovascular and/or respiratory diseases and/or diabetes. SDM elements incorporated in DAs, DA effects and DA itself will be described. DISCUSSION This study will characterize DAs for chronic illness and will provide an overview of their effects on SDM, clinical and patient reported outcomes. We anticipate this review will bring to light knowledge gaps and inform further research into the design and use of DAs for patients with chronic conditions.

Multicentre randomised controlled trial to investigate the usefulness of continuous pneumatic regulation of tracheal cuff pressure for reducing ventilator-associated pneumonia in mechanically ventilated severe trauma patients: the AGATE study protocol

INTRODUCTION: Severe trauma represents the leading cause of mortality worldwide. While 80% of deaths occur within the first 24 hours after trauma, 20% occur later and are mainly due to healthcare-associated infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Preventing underinflation of the tracheal cuff is recommended to reduce microaspiration, which plays a major role in the pathogenesis of VAP. Automatic devices facilitate the regulation of tracheal cuff pressure, and their implementation has the potential to reduce VAP. The objective of this work is to determine whether continuous regulation of tracheal cuff pressure using a pneumatic device reduces the incidence of VAP compared with intermittent control in severe trauma patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This multicentre randomised controlled and open-label trial will include patients suffering from severe trauma who are admitted within the first 24 hours, who require invasive mechanical ventilation to longer than 48 hours. Their tracheal cuff pressure will be monitored either once every 8 hours (control group) or continuously using a pneumatic device (intervention group). The primary end point is the proportion of patients that develop VAP in the intensive care unit (ICU) at day 28. The secondary end points include the proportion of patients that develop VAP in the ICU, early (≤7 days) or late (>7 days) VAP, time until the first VAP diagnosis, the number of ventilator-free days and antibiotic-free days, the length of stay in the ICU, the proportion of patients with ventilator-associated events and that die during their ICU stay. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been approved by the ethics committee of Poitiers University Hospital, and will be carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The results of this study will be disseminated through presentation at scientific conferences and publication in peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials NCT02534974

Cancer and COVID-19: Unmasking their ties.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and its clinical manifestation, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) have rapidly spread across the globe, leading to the declaration of a pandemic. While most present mild symptoms, it appears as though nearly 20% of confirmed patients develop significant complications. These include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock and multi-organ failure, with a 3-6% mortality. A plethora of treatments has been or is being assessed, but to date, none has been proven effective. Management is mainly symptomatic, with organ support for the critically ill. Several reports, mainly case series, from across the world have concluded that patients with malignancy appear more susceptible to severe infection and mortality from COVID-19. This could be attributed to immunosuppression, co-existing medical conditions and underlying pulmonary compromise which is often the case in lung malignancy. Patients with haematological cancer and those who are receiving active chemotherapy treatment may be at greatest risk due to increased immunosuppression. This pandemic tested the resilience of worldwide health-care systems in an unprecedented manner. It has forced oncologists to rethink the entire diagnostic and therapeutic process, based on the local prevalence and impact of COVID-19. In this review we will discuss the impact of COVID-19 on patients affected by cancer, their diagnosis and management, as well as the pathophysiology of COVID-19 induced acute respiratory distress symptoms and currently investigated treatment approaches.

Comparative quantitative survey of patient experience in Barrett's oesophagus and other gastrointestinal disorders.

Objective To assess health-related quality of life in patients with non-dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus (NDBO) and endoscopically treated dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus (DBO). Design This quantitative, self-administered questionnaire study was conducted across three National Health Service hospitals. Data were collected from three other cohorts; gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), colonic polyp surveillance and healthy individuals. Fisher's exact and Spearman's rank correlation tests were used for analysis. Propensity score matching adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities. Results 687 participants were eligible for analysis (NDBO n=306, DBO n=49, GORD n=132, colonic polyps n=152 and healthy n=48). 53% of NDBO participants reported similarly high cancer worry, comparable to DBO (50%, p=0.933) and colonic polyp participants (51%, p=0.355). Less cancer worry was reported in GORD participants (43.4%, p=0.01 vs NDBO). NDBO participants reported anxiety in 15.8% and depression in 8.6% of cases, which was similar to the other disease cohorts. Moderate or severe heartburn or acid regurgitation was found in 11% and 10%, respectively, in the NDBO cohort, comparable to DBO participants (heartburn 2% p=0.172, acid regurgitation 4% p=0.31) but lower (better) than GORD participants (heartburn 31% p=<0.001, acid regurgitation 25% p=0.001). NDBO participants with moderate or severe GORD symptoms were associated with higher rates of anxiety (p=<0.001), depression (p=<0.001) and cancer worry (p=<0.001). NDBO patients appropriately perceiving their cancer risk as low had lower rates of cancer worry (p=<0.001). Conclusion This study provides insight into the problems Barrett's oesophagus patients may face. Future care pathways must be more patient focussed to address misconceptions of cancer risk, oesophageal cancer related worry and GORD symptom control.

Evidence and characteristics of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2

Background: On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 in humans was reported in Wuhan, and then spread fast to other provinces, China. We analyzed data from field investigations and genetic sequencing to describe the evidence and characteristics of human-to-human transmission in Guangdong Province. Methods: A confirmed COVID-19 case was defined if a suspected case was verified with positive of SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), or endotracheal aspirates by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) or genetic sequencing. Field investigations were conducted for each confirmed case. Clinical and demographic data of confirmed cases were collected from medical records. Exposure and travel history were obtained by interview. Results: A total of 1,151 confirmed cases were identified as of February 10, 2020 in Guangdong Province, China. Of them, 697 (60.1%) cases were from 234 cluster infections. Two hundred and fourteen (18.6%) were secondary cases, in which 144 cases were from family cluster infections. With the epidemic continuing, although familial cluster events were dominated, community cluster events increased with a nosocomial event. The whole genomes within the same family cluster infections were identical, and presented a few unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) compared with SARS-CoV-2 identified on December 2019 in Wuhan. Conclusions: We observed evident human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong, China. Although most of them were from family cluster infections, community and nosocomial infections were increasing. Our findings indicate that human-to-human transmission risks are transferring from family to community in Guangdong Province.

Dental care and infection-control procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic: the experience in Taipei City Hospital, Taiwan

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has now widely spread globally. The main transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 comprise human-to-human droplet infection, including inhalation and contact infection of patient’s saliva, blood and other body fluids through oral mucosa, nasal mucosa, and the eyes, and orofecal transmission. Dental treatment necessitates close-proximity, face-to-face practices and can generate droplets or aerosols containing water, saliva, blood, microorganisms, and other debris during the procedure. Therefore, dental professionals are at a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To prevent nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 spread during dental procedures, Taipei City Hospital established a dental patient triage and workflow algorithm for the provision of dental services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2, it is imperative to institute an appropriate standard procedural policy for patient management and recommendation of dental treatment at hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Corticosteroid Administration Is Associated With Improved Outcome in Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2-Related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome

OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical outcome of mechanically ventilated patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome, who received corticosteroid with those who did not. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Intensive care setting. PATIENTS: All adult mechanically ventilated patients, who were admitted to the ICU between March 20, 2020, and May 10, 2020, for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cohort was divided into two groups based on corticosteroid administration. The primary outcome variable was ventilator-free days at day 28. Secondary outcome variable was ICU-free days at day 30, and hospital-free days at day 30. Consecutive 61 mechanically ventilated patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome were analyzed. Patient in corticosteroid group as compared with noncorticosteroid group have higher 28-day ventilator-free days (mean, 10.2; median, 7 [interquartile range, 0–22.3] vs mean, 4.7; median, 0 [interquartile range, 0–11]; p = 0.01).There was no significant difference noted in secondary outcomes (ICU-free days at day 30 and hospital-free days at day 30). CONCLUSIONS: Among mechanically ventilated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, corticosteroids use was associated with significant improvement in 28-day ventilator-free days at day 28, but no significant improvement in ICU-free days at day 30, and hospital-free days at day 30.

Multiple lung abscesses due to acinetobacter infection: a case report

Acinetobacter species are well-known causes of nosocomial infections. Recent increasing evidence emphasize on the role of these pathogens in community-acquired infections. We report a case of a 16-yr-old female with fever, sore throat, productive cough, malaise and the presence of lung consolidation with multiple abscesses on radiographic examination. The patient had no significant medical history. After a detailed diagnostic work-up the diagnosis of community acquired Acinetobacter pneumonia with multiple lung abscesses was made. The Acinetobacter stain was susceptible to a variety of antimicrobial agents and the patient's condition improved rapidly. A new computed tomography chest scan, three months later, confirmed full recovery. The presence of lung abscesses due to Acinetobacter infection is an extremely uncommon manifestation of the disease. This case underlines the emergent role which these, often multi-drug resistant, bacteria may play in the future, perhaps in community infections as well.

Revitalisation of industrial buildings in Hong Kong: New measures, new constraints?

Like many post-industrial cities around the world, Hong Kong has been experiencing de-industrialisation since the 1980s, and revitalisation of multi-storey industrial buildings within a high-density development context is necessary. Focussing on recent progress in revitalisation of industrial buildings in Hong Kong, this research investigates the Government regulations and market responses. It is found that simply relieving the regulations and institutional constraints in revitalisation does not work, either for the policy aim in a narrow sense or for the local economy in a broad sense. New revitalisation measures by the Government have led to new constraints in revitalisation. It is necessary to address the policy lag. This paper presents an opening statement of discussing effectiveness of revitalisation policy in terms of urban competitiveness. It advocates some general principles and goals been taken into account in making revitalisation policy, including industrial diversity, indigenously owned companies, social costs and quality of life.

Emerging Plant Viruses: a Diversity of Mechanisms and Opportunities

Although emerging plant viruses receive much less publicity than their animal- or human-infecting cousins, they pose a serious threat to worldwide agricultural production. These viruses can be new (i.e., not previously known) or already known; however, they share the common characteristic of occupying and spreading within new niches. Factors driving the emergence of plant viruses include genetic variability in the virus, changes in agricultural practices, increases in the population and/or distribution of insect vectors and long-distance transport of plant materials. In recent years, individual as well as entire groups of viruses have emerged, and this has involved a variety of mechanism(s), depending on the virus and the environment. Here, we will discuss some of these viruses, and highlight the mechanisms that have mediated their emergence. Special emphasis is placed upon the whiteflytransmitted geminiviruses (begomoviruses) and the thrips-transmitted tosposviruses, which have emerged as major threats to crop production throughout the world. Other examples include the recent emergence of novel viruslike agents, the acquisition and role of satellite DNA or RNA molecules in emergence of plant viruses, and cases where emerging viruses have had only a transient impact. It seems clear that global movement of plant materials, expansion of agriculture and large-scale monoculture will continue to favor emergence of plant viruses. However, improved diagnostics should allow for rapid identification of emerging viruses and better understanding of viral biology. This information can be used in the development of effective management strategies, which will hopefully minimize impact on agricultural production.

Combined IL-6 and JAK-STAT inhibition therapy in COVID-19 related sHLH, potential game changer

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by novel SARS-CoV-2, leads to significant mortality and morbidity with increasing evidence for inflammatory pathways being implicated in the lung damage it causes. (1,2) Severe COVID-19 patients present with increased inflammatory markers, akin to secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), that have been shown to predict mortality. (3,4) There is emerging evidence for the use of an interleukin 6 (IL-6) inhibitor, tocilizumab (TCZ), for suppression of the inflammatory cytokine storm in this context. (5-7) Ruxolitinib (RXB), a JAK-STAT inhibitor, has also been shown to have proven efficacy in the treatment of sHLH. (8) Both agents appear to be promising in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection, (9,10) leading to an increasing number of trials being registered with their use. (11,12) Until this point, no single agent has shown a survival benefit against SARS-CoV-2 and it is possible that monotherapy may not suppress inflammation enough to overcome the COVID-19 related cytokine storm and hyper-inflammation.

Neurological manifestations of COVID-19, SARS and MERS

Since December 2019, the world is affected by an outbreak of a new disease named COVID-19, which is an acronym of ‘coronavirus disease 2019’. Coronaviruses (CoV) were assumed to be associated with mild upper respiratory tract infections, such as common cold. This perception changed in time due to occurrence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV in 2002 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV in 2012, both inducing an epidemic severe viral pneumonia with potentially respiratory failure and numerous extra-pulmonary manifestations. The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is likewise a causative pathogen for severe viral pneumonia with the risk of progression to respiratory failure and systemic manifestations. In this review, we will give a summary of the neurological manifestations due to SARS and MERS, as those might predict the neurological outcome in the novel COVID-19. Additionally, we provide an overview of the current knowledge concerning neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19, to the extent that literature is already available as the pandemic is still ongoing.

The role of climate during the COVID‐19 epidemic in New South Wales, Australia

Previous research has identified a relationship between climate and occurrence of SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV cases, information that can be used to reduce the risk of infection. Using COVID‐19 notification and postcode data from New South Wales, Australia during the exponential phase of the epidemic in 2020, we used time series analysis to investigate the relationship between 749 cases of locally acquired COVID‐19 and daily rainfall, 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. temperature, and 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. relative humidity. Lower 9 a.m. relative humidity (but not rainfall or temperature) was associated with increased case occurrence; a reduction in relative humidity of 1% was predicted to be associated with an increase of COVID‐19 cases by 6.11%. During periods of low relative humidity, the public health system should anticipate an increased number of COVID‐19 cases.

IL-12 deficiency transiently improves viral clearance during the late phase of respiratory tract infection with influenza A virus in mice

Abstract T helper 1-driven immune responses have been implicated in protective immunity against viral infections. Interleukin (IL)-12 is a heterodimeric proinflammatory cytokine formed by a p35 and a p40 subunit that can induce differentiation of naïve T cells towards a T helper 1-response. To determine the role of IL-12 in respiratory tract infection with influenza, p35 gene deficient (p35−/−) and normal wild type mice were intranasally infected with influenza A virus. IL-12 p35−/− mice displayed a transiently enhanced rather than an impaired viral clearance, as indicated by a 10-fold reduction in viral loads on day 8 after infection. Although interferon-γ levels were significantly lower in the lungs of IL-12 p35−/− mice, their cellular immune responses were not altered, as reflected by similar T cell CD69 expression and influenza-specific T cell recruitment. Our data indicate that endogenous IL-12 impairs viral clearance during the late phase of influenza A virus infection in mice.

Translational Potential of Metabolomics on Animal Models of Inflammatory Bowel Disease-A Systematic Critical Review.

In the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the gut microbiota has been established as a key factor. Recently, metabolomics has become important for understanding the functional relevance of gut microbial changes in disease. Animal models for IBD enable the study of factors involved in disease development. However, results from animal studies may not represent the human situation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether results from metabolomics studies on animal models for IBD were similar to those from studies on IBD patients. Medline and Embase were searched for relevant studies up to May 2017. The Covidence systematic review software was used for study screening, and quality assessment was conducted for all included studies. Data showed a convergence of ~17% for metabolites differentiated between IBD and controls in human and animal studies with amino acids being the most differentiated metabolite subclass. The acute dextran sodium sulfate model appeared as a good model for analysis of systemic metabolites in IBD, but analytical platform, age, and biological sample type did not show clear correlations with any significant metabolites. In conclusion, this systematic review highlights the variation in metabolomics results, and emphasizes the importance of expanding the applied detection methods to ensure greater coverage and convergence between the various different patient phenotypes and animal models of inflammatory bowel disease.

COVID-19 genomic susceptibility: Definition of ACE2 variants relevant to human infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the context of ACMG/AMP Guidance

BACKGROUND: Mortality remains very high and unpredictable in COVID-19, with intense public protection strategies tailored to preceived risk. Genomic studies are in process to identify differences in host susceptibility to infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Open source research publications are accessible to pre-genotyped individuals. Males are more at risk from severe COVID-19. METHODS: To facilitate development of Clinical Genetics support to the public and healthcare professionals, genomic structure and variants in 213,158 exomes/genomes were integrated for ACE2 encoding the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. ACMG/AMP-based pathogenicity criteria were applied. RESULTS: Across the 19 ACE2 exons on the X chromosome, 9 of 3596 (0.25%) nucleotides were homozygous variant in females compared to 262/3596 (7.3%) hemizygous variant in males (p< 0.0001). 90% of variants were very rare, although K26R affecting a SARS-CoV-2-interacting amino acid is present in ~1/239 people. Modelling the ''COVID-resistant '' state where pathogenic alleles would be beneficial, nine null alleles met PVS1. Thirty-seven variants met PM1 based on critical location +/-PP3 based on computational modelling. Modelling a ''COVID-susceptible '' state, 31 variants in four upstream open reading frames and 5' untranslated regions could meet PM1, and may have differential effects if aminoglycoside antibiotics were prescribed for pneumonia and sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Males are more likely to exhibit consequences from a single variant ACE2 allele. Differential allele frequencies in COVID-19 susceptible and resistant individuals are likely to emerge before variants meet ACMG/AMP criteria for actionable results in patients. Prioritising genomic regions for functional study and ACMG/AMP-structured approaches to research-based presentation of COVID-19 susceptibility variant results are encouraged.

Chronic Inflammation in the Context of Everyday Life: Dietary Changes as Mitigating Factors

The lifestyle adopted by most people in Western societies has an important impact on the propensity to metabolic disorders (e.g., diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases). This is often accompanied by chronic low-grade inflammation, driven by the activation of various molecular pathways such as STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), IKK (IκB kinase), MMP9 (matrix metallopeptidase 9), MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases), COX2 (cyclooxigenase 2), and NF-Kβ (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells). Multiple intervention studies have demonstrated that lifestyle changes can lead to reduced inflammation and improved health. This can be linked to the concept of real-life risk simulation, since humans are continuously exposed to dietary factors in small doses and complex combinations (e.g., polyphenols, fibers, polyunsaturated fatty acids, etc.). Inflammation biomarkers improve in patients who consume a certain amount of fiber per day; some even losing weight. Fasting in combination with calorie restriction modulates molecular mechanisms such as m-TOR, FOXO, NRF2, AMPK, and sirtuins, ultimately leads to significantly reduced inflammatory marker levels, as well as improved metabolic markers. Moving toward healthier dietary habits at the individual level and in publicly-funded institutions, such as schools or hospitals, could help improving public health, reducing healthcare costs and improving community resilience to epidemics (such as COVID-19), which predominantly affects individuals with metabolic diseases.

Addressing the triple burden of malnutrition in the time of COVID-19 and climate change in Small Island Developing States: what role for improved local food production?

The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on food and nutrition insecurity are likely to be significant for Small Island Developing States due to their high dependence on foreign tourism, reliance on imported foods and underdeveloped local food production systems. SIDS are already experiencing high rates of nutrition-related death and disability, including double and triple burdens of malnutrition due to unhealthy diets. We consider the potential role for improved local food production to offset the severity of food system shocks in SIDS and identify the need for localized approaches to embrace systems thinking in order to facilitate communication, coordination and build resilience.

Comprehensive overview of COVID-19 clinical trials.

Here, we present an overview of the clinical trials that are currently being conducted or have concluded to date on COVID-19 globally. A comprehensive search was conducted to present 16 trial registries from around the world. Collectively, there are 1,528 trials reported for COVID-19 to date. Out of them, 50 studies included paediatric age group from day 0 to less than or equal to 18 years of age. A few 18 studies involve only females and 20 only males. There are 2 trials currently underway in Bangladesh, 4 in Pakistan and 13 in India. Overall, 940 trials are related to medicines and/or interventions. They include standard of care for any viral illness, antivirals, anti-inflammatory and immune altering medications. Two out of 10 vaccine trials are novel vaccines. It is knowledgeable and resourceful to reach out to the concerned sponsor if a physician thinks his patient can benefit from the trials in the region.

Reported HIV status of tuberculosis patients--United States, 1993-2005.

Knowing the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status of tuberculosis (TB) patients is essential to optimal patient management. TB is an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic condition. Patients with both TB and HIV infection are five times more likely to die during anti-TB treatment than patients who are not HIV infected (CDC, unpublished data, 2003). HIV infection is the greatest known risk factor for progression from latent TB infection to TB disease. In the United States, after TB exposure and infection, HIV-infected persons who do not receive appropriate treatment progress to TB disease over 5 years at a rate 10 times greater than that for persons not infected with HIV. In 1989, CDC recommended that all TB patients be offered HIV testing and, in 2006, called for routine HIV screening of all TB patients after the patient is notified that testing will be performed, unless the patient declines (opt-out screening). In addition to enabling optimal patient management, knowing the HIV status (i.e., positive or negative) of TB patients helps public health agencies to identify HIV-infected contacts of TB patients. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can reduce the progression to TB disease, TB relapse, and death. To assess reported HIV status of TB patients and selected characteristics of TB patients with HIV infection, CDC analyzed data from the U.S. National TB Surveillance System for the period 1993-2005. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that 1) reporting of HIV status among TB patients increased from 35% in 1993 to 68% in 2003, 2) HIV status of 31% of TB patients was unknown in 2005, 3) 9% of TB patients were HIV positive in 2005, and 4) groups of TB patients at greater risk for HIV infection included injection-drug users (IDUs), noninjection-drug users (NIDUs), homeless persons, non-Hispanic blacks, correctional-facility inmates, and alcohol abusers. Increased promotion of routine HIV testing and rapid HIV tests might increase acceptability of testing, which would allow health-care providers to know the HIV status of a greater percentage of TB patients and enable them to provide optimal care.

Complement Receptor 1 availability on red blood cell surface modulates Plasmodium vivax invasion of human reticulocytes

Plasmodium vivax parasites preferentially invade reticulocyte cells in a multistep process that is still poorly understood. In this study, we used ex vivo invasion assays and population genetic analyses to investigate the involvement of complement receptor 1 (CR1) in P. vivax invasion. First, we observed that P. vivax invasion of reticulocytes was consistently reduced when CR1 surface expression was reduced through enzymatic cleavage, in the presence of naturally low-CR1-expressing cells compared with high-CR1-expressing cells, and with the addition of soluble CR1, a known inhibitor of P. falciparum invasion. Immuno-precipitation experiments with P. vivax Reticulocyte Binding Proteins showed no evidence of complex formation. In addition, analysis of CR1 genetic data for worldwide human populations with different exposure to malaria parasites show significantly higher frequency of CR1 alleles associated with low receptor expression on the surface of RBCs and higher linkage disequilibrium in human populations exposed to P. vivax malaria compared with unexposed populations. These results are consistent with a positive selection of low-CR1-expressing alleles in vivax-endemic areas. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CR1 availability on the surface of RBCs modulates P. vivax invasion. The identification of new molecular interactions is crucial to guiding the rational development of new therapeutic interventions against vivax malaria.

Bacterial Pathogen Emergence Requires More than Direct Contact with a Novel Passerine Host

While direct contact may sometimes be sufficient to allow a pathogen to jump into a new host species, in other cases, fortuitously adaptive mutations that arise in the original donor host are also necessary. Viruses have been the focus of most host shift studies, so less is known about the importance of ecological versus evolutionary processes to successful bacterial host shifts. Here we tested whether direct contact with the novel host was sufficient to enable the mid-1990s jump of the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum from domestic poultry to house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus). We experimentally inoculated house finches with two genetically distinct M. gallisepticum strains obtained either from poultry (Rlow) or from house finches (HF1995) during an epizootic outbreak. All 15 house finches inoculated with HF1995 became infected, whereas Rlow successfully infected 12 of 15 (80%) inoculated house finches. Comparisons among infected birds showed that, relative to HF1995, Rlow achieved substantially lower bacterial loads in the host respiratory mucosa and was cleared faster. Furthermore, Rlow-infected finches were less likely to develop clinical symptoms than HF1995-infected birds and, when they did, displayed milder conjunctivitis. The lower infection success of Rlow relative to HF1995 was not, however, due to a heightened host antibody response to Rlow. Taken together, our results indicate that contact between infected poultry and house finches was not, by itself, sufficient to explain the jump of M. gallisepticum to house finches. Instead, mutations arising in the original poultry host would have been necessary for successful pathogen emergence in the novel finch host.

CMV viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage for diagnosis of pneumonia in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation

The objective of this report is to analyze the value of CMV viral load (VL) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) and to analyze the concordance between CMV quantification in plasma and BAL samples. Fifty-six patients were included; in 16 (28.6%) patients with symptoms of lung disease a BAL sample was collected, 7 (43.7%) patients had a VL >150 copies/mL (six had probable CMV pneumonia). Patients with CMV pneumonia were female (100%), of median age 53.5 years, and the median time from transplantion to onset of symptoms was 67.5 days. Pneumonia was early in three cases (incidence 5.4%). Median BAL VL was 53 250 copies/mL and plasma VL was 538 copies/mL (in one patient, the plasma VL was negative). Three (50.0%) patients had an improvement in the first week of treatment, and plasma VL became negative; the other 3 (50.0%) patients died with a CMV pneumonia refractory to treatment. Therefore, any value of CMV VL in BAL, especially if it is greater than plasma, with compatible signs or symptoms, should be considered suggestive of CMV pneumonia in recipients of AHSCT and they should receive specific treatment.

Thoracic ultrasound and SARS-COVID-19: a pictorial essay

Thoracic ultrasound seems to adapt to the screening for lung involvement of patients with suspected or ascertained SARS-COVID-19 infection due to its characteristics of easy applicability. It can be also a relevant method in monitoring patients. B lines are early finding of COVID-19, even in mild-symptomatic subjects; in the most serious cases such as pre-ARDS or ARDS, the B lines end up filling the ultrasound image almost completely, until it merges, so as to create a single hyperechoic image named as "white lung", with distortion and irregularity of the pleural line. In advanced stage, lung consolidations are present, representing pulmonary pathological areas that are no longer normally ventilated.

Importance of homo-dimerization of Fanconi-associated nuclease 1 in DNA flap cleavage

Fanconi-associated nuclease 1 (FAN1) removes interstrand DNA crosslinks (ICLs) through its DNA flap endonuclease and exonuclease activities. Crystal structures of human and bacterial FAN1 bound to a DNA flap have been solved. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial FAN1 and human FAN1 (hFAN1) missing a flexible loop are monomeric, while intact hFAN1 is homo-dimeric in structure. Importantly, the monomeric and dimeric forms of FAN1 exhibit very different DNA binding modes. Here, we interrogate the functional differences between monomeric and dimeric forms of FAN1 and provide an explanation for the discrepancy in oligomeric state between the two hFAN1 structures. Specifically, we show that the flexible loop in question is needed for hFAN1 dimerization. While monomeric and dimeric bacterial or human FAN1 proteins cleave a short 5’ flap strand with similar efficiency, optimal cleavage of a long 5’ flap strand is contingent upon protein dimerization. Our study therefore furnishes biochemical evidence for a role of hFAN1 homodimerization in biological processes that involve 5’ DNA Flap cleavage.

An Online Repository of Solvation Thermodynamic and Structural Maps of SARS-CoV-2 Targets.

SARS-CoV-2 recently jumped species and rapidly spread via human-to-human transmission to cause a global outbreak of COVID-19. The lack of effective vaccine combined with the severity of the disease necessitates attempts to develop small molecule drugs to combat the virus. COVID19_GIST_HSA is a freely available online repository to provide solvation thermodynamic maps of COVID-19-related protein small molecule drug targets. Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory maps were generated using AmberTools cpptraj-GIST and Hydration Site Analysis maps were created using SSTmap code. The resultant data can be applied to drug design efforts: scoring solvent displacement for docking, rational lead modification, prioritization of ligand- and protein- based pharmacophore elements, and creation of water-based pharmacophores. Herein, we demonstrate the use of the solvation thermodynamic mapping data. It is hoped that this freely provided data will aid in small molecule drug discovery efforts to defeat SARS-CoV-2.

Transcriptional Regulation of Flotillins by the Extracellularly Regulated Kinases and Retinoid X Receptor Complexes

Flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 are important regulators of signal transduction pathways such as growth factor signaling. Flotillin expression is increased under pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Despite their importance for signal transduction, very little is known about the transcriptional regulation of flotillins. Here, we analyzed the expression of flotillins at transcriptional level and identified flotillins as downstream targets of the mitogen activated kinases ERK1/2. The promoter activity of flotillins was increased upon growth factor stimulation in a MAPK dependent manner. Overexpression of serum response factor or early growth response gene 1 resulted in increased flotillin mRNA and protein expression. Furthermore, both promoter activity and expression of endogenous flotillins were increased upon treatment with retinoic acid or by overexpression of the retinoid X receptor and its binding partners RARα and PPARγ. Our data indicate that the expression of flotillins, which can be detected in all cultured cells, is fine-tuned in response to various external stimuli. This regulation may be critical for the outcome of signaling cascades in which flotillins are known to be involved.

[Application of convalescent plasma therapy on novel coronavirus infection].

Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) caused by 2019-nCoV was in an outbreak globally. A large number of severe cases lead to strong clinical pressure even treated actively. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy refers to a therapy infusing plasma from recovered donors into other infected individuals. It has played an important role in conquering variety of epidemics over a century with some limitations. Considering the absence of specific treatments, CP has been used for treating COVID-19 and achieved some efficacies. This article provides a reference for clinical application of CP therapy in COVID-19, by discussing the history, mechanism and application of CP therapy in viral diseases such as SARS.

Bonded-communities in HantaVirus research: a research collaboration network (RCN) analysis

Hantavirus, one of the deadliest viruses known to humans, hospitalizes tens of thousands of people each year in Asia, Europe and the Americas. Transmitted by infected rodents and their excreta, Hantavirus are identified as etiologic agents of two main types of diseases—Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the latter having a fatality rate of above 40 %. Although considerable research for over two decades has been going on in this area, bibliometric studies to gauge the state of research of this field have been rare. An analysis of 2631 articles, extracted from WoS databases on Hantavirus between 1980 and 2014, indicated a progressive increase (R (2) = 0.93) in the number of papers over the years, with the majority of papers being published in the USA and Europe. About 95 % papers were co-authored and the most common arrangement was 4–6 authors per paper. Co-authorship has seen a steady increase (R (2) = 0.57) over the years. We apply research collaboration network analysis to investigate the best-connected authors in the field. The author-based networks have 49 components (connected clump of nodes) with 7373 vertices (authors) and 49,747 edges (co-author associations) between them. The giant component (the largest component) is healthy, occupying 84.19 % or 6208 vertices with 47,117 edges between them. By using edge-weight threshold, we drill down into the network to reveal bonded communities. We find three communities’ hotspots—one, led by researchers at University of Helsinki, Finland; a second, led by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, USA; and a third, led by Hokkaido University, Japan. Significant correlation was found between author’s structural position in the network and research performance, thus further supporting a well-studied phenomenon that centrality effects research productivity. However, it was the PageRank centrality that out-performed degree and betweenness centrality in its strength of correlation with research performance.

The hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum intestinal transcriptome provides a platform for selecting drug and vaccine candidates

BACKGROUND: The intestine of hookworms contains enzymes and proteins involved in the blood-feeding process of the parasite and is therefore a promising source of possible vaccine antigens. One such antigen, the hemoglobin-digesting intestinal aspartic protease known as Na-APR-1 from the human hookworm Necator americanus, is currently a lead candidate antigen in clinical trials, as is Na-GST-1 a heme-detoxifying glutathione S-transferase. METHODS: In order to discover additional hookworm vaccine antigens, messenger RNA was obtained from the intestine of male hookworms, Ancylostoma ceylanicum, maintained in hamsters. RNA-seq was performed using Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology. The genes expressed in the hookworm intestine were compared with those expressed in the whole worm and those genes overexpressed in the parasite intestine transcriptome were further analyzed. RESULTS: Among the lead transcripts identified were genes encoding for proteolytic enzymes including an A. ceylanicum APR-1, but the most common proteases were cysteine-, serine-, and metallo-proteases. Also in abundance were specific transporters of key breakdown metabolites, including amino acids, glucose, lipids, ions and water; detoxifying and heme-binding glutathione S-transferases; a family of cysteine-rich/antigen 5/pathogenesis-related 1 proteins (CAP) previously found in high abundance in parasitic nematodes; C-type lectins; and heat shock proteins. These candidates will be ranked for downstream antigen target selection based on key criteria including abundance, uniqueness in the parasite versus the vertebrate host, as well as solubility and yield of expression. CONCLUSION: The intestinal transcriptome of A. ceylanicum provides useful information for the identification of proteins involved in the blood-feeding process, representing a first step towards a reverse vaccinology approach to a human hookworm vaccine. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13071-016-1795-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

[Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)].

On November 2002, 305 cases of atypical pneumonia appeared in southern China. In February 2003, cases were reported in Hong Kong and from there the disease spread to many other countries, mainly, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam and Toronto in Canada. The syndrome was defined as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS), and a person is suspected of having SARS if he/she became ill after November 1 2002, has a fever exceeding 38 degrees C, has symptoms of a respiratory disease and was in a risk area or in close contact with a SARS patient within ten days prior the appearance of symptoms. The World Health Organization has received reports of 4,836 cases, of which 293 persons have died. Most were family members or medical staff treating the patient, persons who came into close and prolonged contact with the patient. The estimated incubation period is two days to one week. Symptoms of the disease include fever, shortness of breath and cough. Ten percent of patients afflicted with SARS require artificial breathing. The mortality rate is 6-7%. A novel coronavirus is associated with this outbreak, and the evidence indicates that this virus has an etiologic role in SARS. Infection is transmitted from person to person through direct or close contact with airborne droplets or personal objects of an infected person. Patients must be isolated and treated by contact and airborne isolation. Treatment consists of support care and artificial respiration when required. The use of anti-viral medications has not yet proven effective.

Comparison of stapled haemorrhoidopexy with traditional excisional surgery for haemorrhoidal disease (eTHoS): a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial.

BACKGROUND Two commonly performed surgical interventions are available for severe (grade II-IV) haemorrhoids; traditional excisional surgery and stapled haemorrhoidopexy. Uncertainty exists as to which is most effective. The eTHoS trial was designed to establish the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of stapled haemorrhoidopexy compared with traditional excisional surgery. METHODS The eTHoS trial was a large, open-label, multicentre, parallel-group, pragmatic randomised controlled trial done in adult participants (aged 18 years or older) referred to hospital for surgical treatment for grade II-IV haemorrhoids. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either traditional excisional surgery or stapled haemorrhoidopexy. Randomisation was minimised according to baseline EuroQol 5 dimensions 3 level score (EQ-5D-3L), haemorrhoid grade, sex, and centre with an automated system to stapled haemorrhoidopexy or traditional excisional surgery. The primary outcome was area under the quality of life curve (AUC) measured with the EQ-5D-3L descriptive system over 24 months, assessed according to the randomised groups. The primary outcome measure was analysed using linear regression with adjustment for the minimisation variables. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN80061723. FINDINGS Between Jan 13, 2011, and Aug 1, 2014, 777 patients were randomised (389 to receive stapled haemorrhoidopexy and 388 to receive traditional excisional surgery). Stapled haemorrhoidopexy was less painful than traditional excisional surgery in the short term and surgical complication rates were similar between groups. The EQ-5D-3L AUC score was higher in the traditional excisional surgery group than the stapled haemorrhoidopexy group over 24 months; mean difference -0·073 (95% CI -0·140 to -0·006; p=0·0342). EQ-5D-3L was higher for stapled haemorrhoidopexy in the first 6 weeks after surgery, the traditional excisional surgery group had significantly better quality of life scores than the stapled haemorrhoidopexy group. 24 (7%) of 338 participants who received stapled haemorrhoidopexy and 33 (9%) of 352 participants who received traditional excisional surgery had serious adverse events. INTERPRETATION As part of a tailored management plan for haemorrhoids, traditional excisional surgery should be considered over stapled haemorrhoidopexy as the surgical treatment of choice.

Community Calls: Lessons and Insights Gained from a Medical-Religious Community Engagement During the COVID-19 Pandemic

During the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, public health instructions were issued with the hope of curbing the virus' spread. In an effort to assure accordance with these instructions, equitable strategies for at-risk and vulnerable populations and communities are warranted. One such strategy was our community conference calls, implemented to disseminate information on the pandemic and allow community leaders to discuss struggles and successes. Over the first 6 weeks, we held 12 calls, averaging 125 (standard deviation 41) participants. Participants were primarily from congregations and faith-based organizations that had an established relationship with the hospital, but also included school leaders, elected officials, and representatives of housing associations. Issues discussed included reasons for quarantining, mental health, social isolation, health disparities, and ethical concerns regarding hospital resources. Concerns identified by the community leaders as barriers to effective quarantining and adherence to precautions included food access, housing density, and access to screening and testing. Through the calls, ways to solve such challenges were addressed, with novel strategies and resources reaching the community. This medical-religious resource has proven feasible and valuable during the pandemic and warrants discussions on reproducing it for other communities during this and future infectious disease outbreaks.

Hemodynamic analysis of fast and slow aneurysm occlusions by flow diversion in rabbits.

PURPOSE To assess hemodynamic differences between aneurysms that occlude rapidly and those occluding in delayed fashion after flow diversion in rabbits. METHODS Thirty-six elastase-induced aneurysms in rabbits were treated with flow diverting devices. Aneurysm occlusion was assessed angiographically immediately before they were sacrificed at 1 (n=6), 2 (n=4), 4 (n=8) or 8 weeks (n=18) after treatment. The aneurysms were classified into a fast occlusion group if they were completely or near completely occluded at 4 weeks or earlier and a slow occlusion group if they remained incompletely occluded at 8 weeks. The immediate post-treatment flow conditions in aneurysms of each group were quantified using subject-specific computational fluid dynamics and statistically compared. RESULTS Nine aneurysms were classified into the fast occlusion group and six into the slow occlusion group. Aneurysms in the fast occlusion group were on average significantly smaller (fast=0.9 cm, slow=1.393 cm, p=0.024) and had smaller ostia (fast=0.144 cm2, slow=0.365 cm2, p=0.015) than aneurysms in the slow occlusion group. They also had a lower mean post-treatment inflow rate (fast=0.047 mL/s, slow=0.155 mL/s, p=0.0239), kinetic energy (fast=0.519 erg, slow=1.283 erg, p=0.0468), and velocity (fast=0.221 cm/s, slow=0.506 cm/s, p=0.0582). However, the differences in the latter two variables were only marginally significant. CONCLUSIONS Hemodynamic conditions after flow diversion treatment of cerebral aneurysms in rabbits are associated with the subsequent aneurysm occlusion time. Specifically, smaller inflow rate, kinetic energy, and velocity seem to promote faster occlusions, especially in smaller and small-necked aneurysms. These results are consistent with previous studies based on clinical series.

Understanding the knowledge, attitudes and practices of providing and receiving nutrition care for prediabetes: an integrative review.

To synthesise the literature on nutrition care for prediabetes from both the perspective of healthcare providers and patients, six databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus and ProQuest) were searched to identify qualitative or quantitative studies that focussed on nutrition care and prediabetes in primary care practice. Studies examining the perspectives of patients with prediabetes and healthcare providers were included. Outcomes of interest included knowledge of nutrition care for prediabetes, attitudes around providing or receiving nutrition care and actual nutrition care practices for prediabetes. Overall, 12851 studies were screened and 26 were included in the final review. Inductive analysis produced five themes: (i) nutrition care is preferable to pharmacological intervention; (ii) patients report taking action for behaviour change; (iii) healthcare providers experience barriers to nutrition care; (iv) healthcare providers tend not to refer patients for nutrition care; and (v) there are contradictory findings around provision and receipt of nutrition care. This review has revealed the contradictions between patients' and healthcare providers' knowledge, attitudes and practices around nutrition care for prediabetes. Further research is needed to shed light on how to resolve these disconnects in care and to improve nutrition care practices for people with prediabetes.

Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals that transmissible gastroenteritis virus activates the JAK-STAT1 signaling pathway.

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine enteropathogenic coronavirus, causes lethal watery diarrhea and severe dehydration in piglets. In this study, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry coupled to isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification labeling was used to quantitatively identify differentially expressed cellular proteins after TGEV infection in PK-15 cells. In total, 162 differentially expressed cellular proteins were identified, including 60 upregulated proteins and 102 downregulated proteins. These differentially expressed proteins were involved in the cell cycle, cellular growth and proliferation, the innate immune response, etc. Interestingly, many upregulated proteins were associated with interferon signaling, especially signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Immunoblotting and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that TGEV infection induces STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, as well as ISG expression. This study for the first time reveals that TGEV induces interferon signaling from the point of proteomic analysis.

Disease Detection or Public Opinion Reflection? Content Analysis of Tweets, Other Social Media, and Online Newspapers During the Measles Outbreak in the Netherlands in 2013

BACKGROUND: In May 2013, a measles outbreak began in the Netherlands among Orthodox Protestants who often refuse vaccination for religious reasons. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare the number of messages expressed on Twitter and other social media during the measles outbreak with the number of online news articles and the number of reported measles cases to answer the question if and when social media reflect public opinion patterns versus disease patterns. METHODS: We analyzed measles-related tweets, other social media messages, and online newspaper articles over a 7-month period (April 15 to November 11, 2013) with regard to topic and sentiment. Thematic analysis was used to structure and analyze the topics. RESULTS: There was a stronger correlation between the weekly number of social media messages and the weekly number of online news articles (P<.001 for both tweets and other social media messages) than between the weekly number of social media messages and the weekly number of reported measles cases (P=.003 and P=.048 for tweets and other social media messages, respectively), especially after the summer break. All data sources showed 3 large peaks, possibly triggered by announcements about the measles outbreak by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment and statements made by well-known politicians. Most messages informed the public about the measles outbreak (ie, about the number of measles cases) (93/165, 56.4%) followed by messages about preventive measures taken to control the measles spread (47/132, 35.6%). The leading opinion expressed was frustration regarding people who do not vaccinate because of religious reasons (42/88, 48%). CONCLUSIONS: The monitoring of online (social) media might be useful for improving communication policies aiming to preserve vaccination acceptability among the general public. Data extracted from online (social) media provide insight into the opinions that are at a certain moment salient among the public, which enables public health institutes to respond immediately and appropriately to those public concerns. More research is required to develop an automatic coding system that captures content and user’s characteristics that are most relevant to the diseases within the National Immunization Program and related public health events and can inform official responses.

Molecular characteristics of a novel strain of canine minute virus associated with hepatitis in a dog

A 5-year-old female Yorkshire terrier dog died a few days following hernia and ovariohysterectomy surgeries. Necropsy performed on the dog revealed that the surgeries were not the cause of death; however, degenerative viral hepatitis, showing intranuclear inclusion bodies in hepatic cells, was observed in histopathologic examination. Several diagnostic methods were used to screen for the cause of disease, and minute virus of canines (MVC) was detected in all parenchymal organs, including the liver. Other pathogens that may cause degenerative viral hepatitis were not found. Infection with MVC was confirmed by in situ hybridization, which revealed the presence of MVC nucleic acid in the liver tissue of the dog. Through sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the nearly complete genome sequence, the strain was found to be distinct from other previously reported MVC strains. These results indicate that this novel MVC strain might be related to degenerative viral hepatitis in dogs.

Laparoscopic transperitoneal nephrectomy in non-functioning inflammatory kidneys with or without renal stone.

OBJECTIVE To compare our laparoscopic simple nephrectomy results in non-functioning inflammatory kidneys with or without renal stones. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients, who underwent laparoscopic transperitoneal nephrectomy for non-functioning kidney between June, 2010 and October, 2014 were included to study. Overall, data of 32 patients including 15 patients with renal stone (Group 1) and 17 patients without renal stone (Group 2) were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Mean age was 44.4 ± 18.5 years (10-71) in group 1 and 35.2 ± 21 years (9-77) in group 2. Mean operation time was 95.0±25.9 minutes (70-175) in group 1 and 86.7 ± 15.1 minutes (70-125) in group 2. Mean estimated blood loss was found to be 64.13 ± 26.67 ml (30-120) in group 1 and 58.94 ± 24.24 ml (30-100) in group 2. Both groups had inflammatory findings in pathological analysis. There was no significant difference between groups regarding estimated blood loss, operation time, pre-operative and post-operative hemoglobin values, percent hemoglobin decrease, complications and hospitalization times (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Non-functioning kidney with or without renal stone could be operated safely with comparable complication rates and success via laparoscopy in experienced hands.

Reduce Driveline Trauma Through Stabilization and Exit Site Management: 30 Days Feasibility Results from the Multicenter RESIST Study.

The percutaneous lead management kit (PLMK) was developed for the HeartMate 2 (HM2) left ventricular assist device (LVAD) to reduce trauma at the exit site and to maintain a clean environment. REduce Driveline Trauma through StabIlization and Exit Site ManagemenT (RESIST) was a multicenter, prospective, nonrandomized study designed to evaluate the feasibility of the PLMK for managing the HM2 driveline exit site. Fifty patients were enrolled at five sites at a median of 495 days post-HM2 implant; 92% (46 of 50) of patients used the PLMK for a minimum of 30 days. At 30 days, more patients found the PLMK to be extremely comfortable (80% vs. 37%, p < 0.001) and extremely effective at stabilizing the driveline (82% vs. 40%, p < 0.001) compared with each center's standard of care. Frequency of dressing changes was 6-7 days or higher for 85% of the patients with PLMK. Three patients developed driveline infection while on PLMK (6%, 0.15 events per patient year), and 35 patients continued to use the PLMK after 6 months. The PLMK is easy to use, increases patient comfort, and increases driveline stability with a dressing change frequency of 6-7 days.

The inflammatory response in transgastric surgery: gastric content leak leads to localized inflammatory response and higher adhesive disease.

BACKGROUND Risk of gastric spillage during transgastric surgery is a potential complication of NOTES procedures. The aim of this study was to determine risk outcomes from gastric spillage in a rat survival model by measuring local and systemic inflammatory markers, adhesive disease, and morbidity. METHODS We performed a minilaparotomy with needle aspiration of 2 ml of gastric contents mixed with 2 ml of sterile saline (study group, SG) or 4 ml of sterile saline (control group, CG) injected into the peritoneal cavity of 60 male rats. Inflammatory markers (TNFalpha, IL-6, and IL-10) were analyzed at 1, 3, 6, and 24 h postoperatively by obtaining plasma levels and peritoneal washings. At necropsy, the peritoneal cavity was examined grossly for adhesions. RESULTS Adhesions were seen more frequently in the SG versus the CG (100% vs. 33.3%, p < 0.014). There was a significant difference in the peritoneal TNFalpha levels in the SG compared with the CG, which peaked 1 h after surgery (p < 0.02). Both peritoneal IL-6 and IL-10 levels were higher in the SG versus the CG, which peaked 3 h after surgery (p < 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively). All peritoneal inflammatory markers returned to undetectable levels at 24 h for both groups. Plasma cytokines were undetectable at all time intervals. CONCLUSION The inflammatory response was found to be a localized and not systemic event, with plasma cytokine levels remaining normal while peritoneal washings revealed a brisk, short-lived localized inflammatory response. There was a significantly higher rate of adhesive disease in the SG compared with the CG; this, however did not translate into a difference in apparent clinical outcome. We conclude that gastric leakage in this NOTES rodent model induces a localized inflammatory response, followed by mild to moderate adhesive disease. This may be important in human NOTES.

Nasal plugs for preventing respiratory infections.

Nasal plugs were made from an N-95 respirator, surgical mask or a cotton ball and inserted into the nares of volunteer healthcare workers for 30 min. Initial and persistent respiratory resistance, choking sensation, and discomfort in the mouth and nose areas were recorded for the three different nasal plugs, the N-95 respirator and a surgical mask. Nasal plugs were more convenient and better tolerated than the masks. The ability of the nasal plug material to prevent infection by droplet transmission was also tested. A piece of each material was placed on a blood agar plate, the volunteer coughed onto the plate and the material was removed. Bacterial colonies only grew in the areas not previously covered by the nasal plug material. The cotton ball nasal plug is probably as effective as the N-95 respirator or surgical masks at preventing infection, and is much cheaper.

Emergency nurses’ perceptions regarding the risks appraisal of the threat of the emerging infectious disease situation in emergency departments

Purpose: Emerging infectious diseases are considered as a pressing challenge to global public health. Throughout public health response to emerging infectious diseases, emergency nurses are situated at the forefront of the healthcare system. The present study has explored emergency nurses’ perceptions regarding the risks appraisal of the threat of the emerging infectious disease situation in emergency department context. Methods: The present study used a qualitative descriptive approach. A purposive sampling method was employed to recruit emergency nurses who worked in public hospitals in Hong Kong. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to 24 emergency nurses. The data were interpreted using a thematic analysis strategy. Results: Five overarching themes emerged from the data: (1) the novelty of an emerging infectious disease, (2) the severity of an emerging infectious disease, (3) the proximity to an emerging infectious disease, (4) the complexity of an emerging infectious disease situation, and (5) the response levels towards an emerging infectious disease situation. Conclusion: It is anticipated that the information may help to predict the attitudes and behaviours of emergency nurses in future impending epidemic events, enhancing emergency nurses’ preparedness towards in such situations.

Emerging respiratory and novel coronavirus 2012 infections and mass gatherings.

Mass gatherings are attended by an increasingly global audience and thus raise the concern of possible acute public health risks not normally encountered by the host population. The potential acute risks to individual and population health include communicable diseases. The communicable disease risks include emerging and re-emerging diseases in host and visiting populations. In this review, we provide an overview ofthe literature on respiratory infections at mass gatherings, then describe the impact of novel coronavirus 2012 (nCoV), an emerging respiratory disease virus, on the preparations for mass gathering. Although, nCoV emerged prior to the 2012 Hajj pilgrimage season, Muslims completed their religious duty without acquiring infections by nCoV. Clearly, the global nature of mass gatherings and their potential risks to international health make it imperative that research on such events and guidelines produced for their management are relevant to diverse contexts and are a collaborative effort between global experts.

Quality of life in 265 patients with gastroenteropancreatic or bronchial neuroendocrine tumors treated with [177Lu-DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotate.

UNLABELLED Quality of life (QOL) is an important outcome in cancer therapy. In this study, we investigated the QOL and symptoms after [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate ((177)Lu-octreotate) therapy in patients with inoperable or metastasized gastroenteropancreatic or bronchial neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). METHODS Two hundred sixty-five Dutch patients completed the QOL questionnaire of the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer after being treated for NETs. ANOVA was used for statistical analyses, with a P value of 0.05 or less being considered significant. Differences of at least 10 points in global health status (GHS)/QOL scores, symptom scores, and Karnofsky performance scores (KPS) before and after therapy were regarded as indicating an improvement. RESULTS Regardless of the treatment outcome, GHS/QOL, insomnia, appetite loss, and diarrhea improved significantly in the total group. These improvements were also seen in patients with bone metastases or a decrease of 50% or more in chromogranin A. Improvement in the scores by at least 10 points was also analyzed in a subgroup of patients with decreased GHS/QOL or symptoms at the start of therapy: in 36% of these patients, GHS/QOL improved after therapy; in 49%, fatigue; in 70%, nausea plus vomiting; in 53%, pain; in 44%, dyspnea; in 59%, insomnia; in 63%, appetite loss; in 60%, constipation; and in 67%, diarrhea. Additionally, we did not see a statistically significant deterioration in patients who had GHS/QOL 100, KPS 100, or no symptoms at the start. In patients with initial stable disease or remission after treatment, GHS/QOL and KPS decreased significantly when regrowth of the tumors occurred. CONCLUSION GHS/QOL, KPS, and symptoms improved significantly after (177)Lu-octreotate therapy, and there was no significant decrease in QOL in patients who had no symptoms before therapy. In patients who had suboptimal scores for GHS/QOL or symptoms before therapy, a clinically significant improvement was demonstrated. Our results indicate that (177)Lu-octreotate therapy not only reduces tumors and prolongs overall survival but also improves the patients' self-assessed QOL.

Virus spread and voter model on random graphs with multiple type nodes

When modelling epidemics or spread of information on online social networks, it is crucial to include not just the density of the connections through which infections can be transmitted, but also the variability of susceptibility. Different people have different chance to be infected by a disease (due to age or general health conditions), or, in case of opinions, ones are easier to be convinced by others, or stronger at sharing their opinions. The goal of this work is to examine the effect of multiple types of nodes on various random graphs such as Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graphs, preferential attachment random graphs and geometric random graphs. We used two models for the dynamics: SEIR model with vaccination and a version of voter model for exchanging opinions. In the first case, among others, various vaccination strategies are compared to each other, while in the second case we studied sevaral initial configurations to find the key positions where the most effective nodes should be placed to disseminate opinions.

INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the suspension of programmed activity in most of the Endoscopy Units in our environment. The aim of this document is to facilitate the resumption of elective endoscopic activity in an efficient and safe manner. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A series of questions considered to be of clinical and logistical relevance were formulated. In order to elaborate the answers, a structured bibliographic search was carried out in the main databases and the recommendations of the main Public Health and Digestive Endoscopy institutions were reviewed. The final recommendations were agreed upon through telematic means. RESULTS: A total of 33 recommendations were made. The main aspects discussed are: 1) Reassessment and prioritization of the indication, 2) Restructuring of spaces, schedules and health personnel, 3) Screening for infection, 4) Hygiene measures and personal protective equipment. CONCLUSION: The AEG and SEED recommend restarting endoscopic activity in a phased, safe manner, adapted to local resources and the epidemiological situation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Risk Profiles of Financial Service Portfolio for Women Segment Using Machine Learning Algorithms

Typically, women are scored with a lower financial risk than men. However, the understanding of variables and indicators that lead to such results, are not fully understood. Furthermore, the stochastic nature of the data makes it difficult to generate a suitable profile to offer an adequate financial portfolio to the women segment. As the amount, variety, and speed of data increases, so too does the uncertainty inherent within, leading to a lack of confidence in the results. In this research, machine learning techniques are used for data analysis. In this way, faster, more accurate results are obtained than in traditional models (such as statistical models or linear programming) in addition to their scalability.

Facile continuous production of soy peptide nanogels via nanoscale flash desolvation for drug entrapment.

A facile continuous production of soy peptide nanogels was demonstrated using a multi-inlet vortex micromixer for the entrapment of active ingredients. The full flow regime in the micromixer was systematically studied to understand the flow impact on nanogel size, drug encapsulation efficiency and drug loading efficiency. Ibuprofen was chosen as a model drug to demonstrate encapsulation capability. The study showed that the nanogel size, drug encapsulation efficiency and drug loading efficiency did not alter significantly as long as the flow rates were in transition and turbulent regimes. The driving force behind the folding of peptides within the microenvironment is kinetic mixing with high flow rates, which dominates in comparison to molecular diffusion, nucleation, and growth. Moreover, the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance of the soy peptides determined the drug encapsulation efficiency and the drug loading efficiency, which did not vary much under different manufacturing parameters. Both characteristics are beneficial to mass production of drug-entrapped peptide. In a 50% water-ethanol mixture, the encapsulation efficiency achieved 70% and the drug loading efficiency was up to 25% in transition and turbulent flow regimes. This work opens the avenues to continuous production of drug-entrapped soy peptide nanogels using a multi-inlet vortex micromixer.

Excess Mortality Estimation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Preliminary Data from Portugal

INTRODUCTION: Portugal is experiencing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic since March 2020. All-causes mortality in Portugal increased during March and April 2020 compared to previous years, but this increase is not explained by COVID-19 reported deaths. The aim of this study was to analyze and consider other criteria for estimating excessive all-cause mortality during the early COVID-19 pandemic period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Public data was used to estimate excess mortality by age and region between March 1 and April 22, proposing baselines adjusted for the lockdown period. RESULTS: An excess mortality of 2400 to 4000 deaths was observed. Excess mortality was associated with older age groups (over age 65) [corrected]. DISCUSSION: The data suggests a ternary explanation for early excess mortality: COVID-19, non-identified COVID-19 and decrease in access to healthcare. The estimates have implications in terms of communication of non-pharmaceutical actions, for research, and to healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: Despite the inherent uncertainty, the excess mortality occurred between March 1 and April 22 could be 3.5- to 5-fold higher than what can be explained by the official COVID-19 deaths [corrected].

Healthcare epidemiology: the current status of planning for pandemic influenza and implications for health care planning in the United States.

The United States needs to be better prepared for a large-scale medical catastrophe, be it a natural disaster, a bioterrorism act, or a pandemic. There are substantial planning efforts now devoted to responding to an influenza pandemic. Here, we review these efforts and identify some harsh realities: (1) the US health care system is private, competitive, broke, and at capacity, so that any demand for surge cannot be met with existing economic resources, hospital beds, manpower, or supplies; (2) the emphasis placed on the development and rapid production of an effective vaccine is excellent, but the effort is underfunded to meet global demand; (3) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's community mitigation measures, such as the use nonpharmacological and social interventions (e.g., use of face masks or respirators, social distancing, and closure of schools), lack validation and could have substantial indirect and unintended consequences. Finally, international collaborations are essential for disease surveillance and to assure investigator access to influenza strains, equitable vaccine distribution, and availability of critical supplies from offshore sources.

Reference-Based Haplotype Phasing with FPGAs

Haplotype phasing of individual samples is commonly carried out as a precursor step before genotype imputation to reduce the runtime complexity of the imputation step and to improve imputation accuracy. The phasing process is time-consuming and generally exceeds hours even on server-grade computing systems. Loh et al. recently introduced a fast and effective reference-based haplotype phasing software named EAGLE2 which scales linearly with the number of reference samples and variants to phase. We discovered that from the several steps of the EAGLE2 phasing process, data preparation for the internally used HapHedge data structure already consumes about half of the total runtime in general use cases. We addressed this problem by introducing a new design for reconfigurable architectures that accelerates this part of the software by a factor of up to 29 on a Xilinx Kintex UltraScale FPGA, resulting in a total speedup of the complete phasing process of almost 2 (the theoretical limit according to Amdahl’s Law) when compared to a server-grade computing system with two Intel Xeon CPUs. As a result, we reduced the EAGLE2 runtime of genome-wide phasing of 520,000 variants in 2500 samples using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel from 68 min to 39 min on our system while maintaining quality.

Responding to Health Care Professionals' Mental Health Needs During COVID-19 Through the Rapid Implementation of Project ECHO.

OBJECTIVE The COVID-19 pandemic can cause significant mental health distress amongst health care professionals (HCPs). We describe the psychological needs of HCPs during COVID-19 and the implementation of Project ECHO Coping with COVID (ECHO-CWC) to help HCPs' manage COVID-19 distress. METHODS We used an established rapid implementation approach to accelerate the development and delivery of ECHO-CWC to address the emerging needs of HCPs. Participants' needs were identified using a 10-question survey of participants' perceived risk of COVID-19 and a 5-item self-efficacy measure. Implementation outcomes consisted of participant engagement and session satisfaction scores using a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS 426 participants registered for ECHO-CWC. Needs assessment data (n=129) showed that most participants' reported feeling increased stress at work (84.5%), fear of infecting others (75.2%), and fear of falling ill (70.5%) from COVID-19, yet most participants accepted the risk associated with work during this time (59.7%). Participants were highly satisfied with the initial five sessions (mean=4.26). CONCLUSION HCPs reported the greatest concern with fears of infection and infecting others during the acute phase of the pandemic. Using an iterative curriculum design approach and existing implementation frameworks, the ECHO tele-education model can be rapidly mobilized to address HCPs mental health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Evaluation of a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-based candidate pandemic influenza A/H1N1 vaccine in the ferret model.

The zoonotic transmissions of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype that have occurred since 1997 have sparked the development of novel influenza vaccines. The advent of reverse genetics technology, cell-culture production techniques and novel adjuvants has improved the vaccine strain preparation, production process and immunogenicity of the vaccines, respectively, and has accelerated the availability of pandemic influenza vaccines. However, there is still room for improvement, and alternative vaccine preparations can be explored, such as viral vectors. Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), originally developed as a safe smallpox vaccine, can be exploited as a viral vector and has many favourable properties. Recently, we have demonstrated that an MVA-based vaccine could protect mice and macaques against infection with highly pathogenic influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype. In the present study, recombinant MVA expressing the haemagglutinin (HA) gene of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus was evaluated in the ferret model. A single immunization induced modest antibody responses and afforded only modest protection against the development of severe disease upon infection with a 2009(H1N1) strain. In contrast, two immunizations induced robust antibody responses and protected ferrets from developing severe disease, confirming that MVA is an attractive influenza vaccine production platform.

Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

BACKGROUND The efficacy of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains controversial. METHODS In an international clinical trial, we randomly assigned patients with very severe ARDS, as indicated by one of three criteria - a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 50 mm Hg for more than 3 hours; a Pao2:Fio2 of less than 80 mm Hg for more than 6 hours; or an arterial blood pH of less than 7.25 with a partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide of at least 60 mm Hg for more than 6 hours - to receive immediate venovenous ECMO (ECMO group) or continued conventional treatment (control group). Crossover to ECMO was possible for patients in the control group who had refractory hypoxemia. The primary end point was mortality at 60 days. RESULTS At 60 days, 44 of 124 patients (35%) in the ECMO group and 57 of 125 (46%) in the control group had died (relative risk, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 1.04; P=0.09). Crossover to ECMO occurred a mean (±SD) of 6.5±9.7 days after randomization in 35 patients (28%) in the control group, with 20 of these patients (57%) dying. The frequency of complications did not differ significantly between groups, except that there were more bleeding events leading to transfusion in the ECMO group than in the control group (in 46% vs. 28% of patients; absolute risk difference, 18 percentage points; 95% CI, 6 to 30) as well as more cases of severe thrombocytopenia (in 27% vs. 16%; absolute risk difference, 11 percentage points; 95% CI, 0 to 21) and fewer cases of ischemic stroke (in no patients vs. 5%; absolute risk difference, -5 percentage points; 95% CI, -10 to -2). CONCLUSIONS Among patients with very severe ARDS, 60-day mortality was not significantly lower with ECMO than with a strategy of conventional mechanical ventilation that included ECMO as rescue therapy.

Acute phase protein changes in calves during an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by bovine respiratory syncytial virus

Abstract Bovine acute phase proteins (APPs), lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin (Hp) and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) were evaluated as inflammatory markers during an outbreak of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) caused by bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV). Calves (n =10) presented mild to moderate signs of respiratory disease. Secondary bacterial infections, Pasteurella multocida and Mycoplasma dispar as major species, were detected in tracheobronchial lavage samples. Concentrations of SAA and LBP increased at week 1 had the highest values at week 3 and decreased at week 4 of outbreak. Some calves had high Hp concentrations at week 3, but AGP concentrations did not rise during respiratory disease. Higher SAA, LBP and Hp concentrations at a later stage of BRD (week 3) were associated with the low BRSV-specific IgG1 production, suggesting that these calves had enhanced inflammatory response to the secondary bacterial infection. In conclusion, APPs (especially SAA and LBP) are sensitive markers of respiratory infection, and they may be useful to explore host response to the respiratory infections in clinical research.

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with suspected COVID-19 admitted in Metro Manila, Philippines

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to almost every region and country in the world, leading to widespread travel restrictions and national lockdowns. Currently, there are limited epidemiological and clinical data on COVID-19 patients from low and middle-income countries. We conducted a retrospective single-center study of the first 100 individuals with suspected COVID-19 (between Jan. 25 and Mar. 29, 2020) admitted to San Lazaro Hospital (SLH), the national infectious diseases referral hospital in Manila, Philippines. RESULTS: Demographic data, travel history, clinical features, and outcomes were summarized and compared between COVID-19 confirmed and non-confirmed cases. The first two confirmed cases were Chinese nationals, admitted on Jan. 25. The third confirmed case was a Filipino, admitted on Mar. 8. Trends toward confirmed COVID-19 cases not reporting international travel and being admitted to SLH from the densely populated area of Manila city were observed during Mar. 8-29. All 42 of the 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases were adults, 40% were aged 60 years and above and 55% were male. Three were health workers. Among individuals with suspected COVID-19, confirmed cases were more likely to be older, Filipino, not report international travel history and have at least one underlying disease, particularly diabetes, report difficulty in breathing, and a longer duration of symptoms. In over 90% of non-COVID-19 cases, the alternative diagnosis was respiratory. Nine (21%) confirmed cases died. The median duration from symptoms onset to death was 11.5 (range: 8–18) days. CONCLUSIONS: Imported COVID-19 cases have reduced but local transmission persists and there is a trend toward cases being admitted to SLH from densely populated areas. This study highlights the difficulty in diagnosing COVID-19 on clinical grounds and the importance of diagnostic capacity in all settings. Difficulty of breathing was the only symptom associated with COVID-19 infection and should alert clinicians to the possibility of COVID-19. Clinical characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 cases and a hospital case fatality rate of 21% are comparable with other settings.

Direct observation of distinct A/P hybrid-state tRNAs in translocating ribosomes

Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) link the genetic code in the form of messenger RNA (mRNA) to protein sequence. Translocation of tRNAs through the ribosome from aminoacyl (A) site to peptidyl (P) site, and from P-site to exit (E) site is catalysed in eukaryotes by the translocase elongation factor 2 (EF-2), and in prokaryotes by its homologue EF-G. During tRNA movement one or more “hybrid” states (A/P) is occupied, but molecular details of them and of the translocation process are limited. Here we show by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) that a population of mammalian ribosomes stalled at an mRNA pseudoknot structure contains structurally-distorted tRNAs in two different A/P hybrid states. In one (A/P’) the tRNA is in contact with the translocase EF-2 which induces it. In the other (A/P”) the translocase is absent. The existence of these alternative A/P intermediate states has relevance to our understanding of the mechanics and kinetics of translocation.

Comparison of Long-term Clinical Outcomes according to the Change in the Rectocele Depth between Transanal and Transvaginal Repairs for a Symptomatic Rectocele.

PURPOSE This study was aimed to compare the results of a transanal repair with those of a transvaginal levatorplasty and to determine the long-term clinical outcomes according to the change in the depth of the rectocele after the procedure. METHODS Of 50 women who underwent a rectocele repair from March 2005 to February 2007, 26 women (group A) received a transanal repair, and 24 (group B) received a transvaginal repair with or without levatorplasty. At 12 months after the procedures, 45 (group A/B, 22/23 women) among the 50 women completed physiologic studies, including anal manometry and defecography, and clinical-outcome measurements. The variations of the clinical outcomes with changes in the depth of the rectocele were also evaluated in 42 women (group A/B, 20/22) at the median follow-up of 50 months. RESULTS On the defecographic findings, the postoperative depth of the rectocele decreased significantly in both groups (group A vs. B, 1.91 ± 0.20 vs. 2.25 ± 0.46, P = 0.040). At 12 months after surgery, 17 women in each group (group A/B, 77/75%) reported improvement of their symptoms. However, only 11 and 13 women (group A/B, 55/59%) of groups A and B, respectively, maintained their improvement at the median follow-up of 50 months. Better results were reported in patients with a greater change in the depth of their rectocele (≥4 cm) after the procedure (P = 0.001) CONCLUSION In both procedures, clinical outcomes might become progressively worse as the length of the follow-up is increased.

[EMCAM (Multiple Sclerosis Autonomous Community of Madrid) document for the management of patients with multiple sclerosis during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic].

INTRODUCTION The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is forcing neurologists to carry out a series of adaptations in the management of multiple sclerosis. Neurologists must weigh up the need to start or continue disease-modifying treatments against the risk of infection, the risk of complications from the infection, and the risk of multiple sclerosis activity. Since this is an unprecedented situation, most decisions are being made on the basis of a theoretical approach and the criteria of each neurologist. AIMS The aim of this study is conduct a literature search to collect available evidence on the relationship between disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection. This evidence, together with the experience of the authors in the management of patients with multiple sclerosis during the pandemic, will make it possible to offer some proposals for the treatment and follow-up of patients in this epidemiological context. DEVELOPMENT After the literature search and our experience in the management of patients, a number of proposals for treatment are established for each drug, which must necessarily be individualised for each patient, since, in these exceptional circumstances, their peculiarities can affect the prognosis. CONCLUSIONS The neurologist should be aware of current evidence to assess the risk-benefit of starting, maintaining and stopping disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis during the pandemic.

The pain quality response profile of a corticosteroid injections and heated lidocaine/tetracaine patch in the treatment of shoulder impingement syndrome.

OBJECTIVES To describe the effects of 2 pain treatments for shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS), and illustrate how investigators can use pain quality information to understand treatment response differences. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study presents pain quality data from a randomized open-label study comparing the effects of an injection of triamcinolone and up to twice daily application of a heated lidocaine/tetracaine (Trilexis) patch in individuals with SIS. Study participants completed a measure of pain quality at baseline and again on study days 14, 28, and 42 following initiation of 2 treatments for SIS. Baseline and posttreatment pain quality scores were graphed to provide a visual representation of treatment-associated changes. Analyses of variance were used to examine the differences between treatment conditions in changes in pain quality with treatment. RESULTS Both treatments resulted in substantial (and similar) pretreatment to posttreatment improvements in many pain qualities. However, differences in the time course of treatment effects were observed for itchy and heavy qualities. DISCUSSION Although 2 different pain treatments appear to have the same effects when only pretreatment to posttreatment changes are examined, treatment differences emerged when the time course of treatment is examined. The findings support the importance of assessing both pain qualities and time course of treatment as outcome domains. The results illustrate how investigators can use data from clinical trials to provide a more fine-tuned description of treatment effects, providing knowledge that could be helpful in selecting treatment options at the individual patient level. SUMMARY Examination of the effects of pain treatments on pain qualities over time will help researchers and clinicians understand if certain pain quality domains respond faster to one treatment versus another, and may identify differences between treatments that would not be observed by measures of global pain intensity alone.

Diagnostic moléculaire des infections respiratoires à entérovirus : apport de la PCR et du génotypage pour une meilleure approche de la circulation des souches en Basse-Normandie au cours de l’année 2008

Résumé Alors que la place de la PCR est bien reconnue pour le diagnostic des infections neuroméningées à entérovirus (EV), l’utilisation des techniques de biologie moléculaire dans les infections respiratoires à EV est encore mal définie. Objectifs Définir les apports des outils moléculaires (PCR et génotypage) dans le diagnostic et l’épidémiologie des infections respiratoires à EV. Méthodes Au cours de l’année 2008, 3612 sécrétions nasales ont eu une recherche virale par IFD et culture MRC5. Dans un second temps, sont réalisés une recherche virale sur culture HuH7 (SN négative en IF) et une PCR duplex entérorhinovirus (PEVRV) sur 816 surnageants de culture HuH7 présentant un ECP. De plus, 327 SN de nouveau-nés ont eu une recherche systématique par la PCR EV temps réel « maison » (PEV) utilisée pour le diagnostic des infections méningées. Un génotypage a été réalisé chez 68 patients présentant une identification d’EV sur surnageants de cultures MRC5 ou HuH7. Résultats Trente-cinq EV ont été isolés en culture (0,97 %) ; la combinaison des deux PCR, PEVRV et PEV, a permis d’identifier respectivement, 41 EV, 8 EV-RV et 12 RV supplémentaires, portant le nombre de positif à 96 (2,6 %). Chez les NN, 32 (11,3 %) SN sont positives avec la PEV. Parmi les 98 SN testées par PEV et PEVRV, 27 étaient positives et nous avons détecté dix EV, cinq EV-RV et 12 RV. De janvier à décembre 2008, la distribution saisonnière montre le pic estival habituel d’infections méningées et un pic automnal correspondant d’infections respiratoires. Cinq sérotypes prédominent : 19 EV68 (29,7 %), 12 CB3 (18,7 %), neuf E3 (14,1 %), six CA9 (9,4 %) et six CB1 (9,4 %). Les EV68 sont tous isolés en octobre à novembre et 17/19 (89,5 %) des patients positifs ont été hospitalisés avec des signes d’insuffisance respiratoire aiguë. Conclusion Les méthodes de diagnostic moléculaires des infections respiratoires à EV (PCR et génotypage) permettent d’identifier précisément les souches circulantes dans un temps relativement court, apportant un bénéfice épidémiologique, clinique et économique de santé. Abstract The PCR assays are currently used in diagnosis of enterovirus (EV) meningitis. Nevertheless, the use of molecular diagnosis of EV should be investigated in respiratory tract infections (RTI). Objectives To perform enterovirus molecular diagnostic tools, PCR and genotyping, in nasal samples for diagnostic and epidemiologic purposes. Methods During 2008, 3612 nasal specimen (NS) were studied by IFD and MRC5 culture. Next, we realised successively viral isolation on HuH7 culture (for NS negative by IFD assay) and a duplex PCR enterovirus-rhinovirus for the 816 HuH7 positive supernatants. Furthermore, 327 NS collected from neonates were systematically tested by a real-time RT-PCR. This assay was used in routine for EV diagnosis setting in cerebrospinal fluid. Enterovirus genotyping was then performed for the 68 positive supernatants. Results Thirty-five NS (0.97%) were positive for EV by culture (MRC5). A combination of both PCR assays, PEVRV and PEV, allowed an additional identification of 41 EV, eight EV-RV and 12 RV, increasing the number of positive to 96 NS (2.6%). Among the neonates, 32 NS (11.3%) were positive for EV by PEV. Of the 98 NS tested by the two PCR assays (PEV and PEVRV), 27 were positive and we detected 10 EV, five EV-RV and 12 RV. From January to December 2008, the circulation of EV showed the usual peak in June–July when a small outbreak of aseptic meningitis occurred and an additional autumnal peak corresponding to respiratory tract infections. Five main serotypes were isolated: 19 EV68 (29.7%), 12 CB3 (18.7%), nine E3 (14,1%), six CA9 (9.4%) and six CB1 (9.4%); the 19 EV68 were isolated in October–November and 17/19 (89.5%) of positive patients were hospitalised for severe respiratory diseases. Conclusion The use of molecular screening techniques (PCR assays and genotyping) on nasal samples collected from patients with respiratory infections allowed a prospective, effective and precise identification of circulating strains.

Complications Among Adults Hospitalized With Influenza: A Comparison of Seasonal Influenza and the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic

Background. Persons with influenza can develop complications that result in hospitalization and death. These are most commonly respiratory related, but cardiovascular or neurologic complications or exacerbations of underlying chronic medical conditions may also occur. Patterns of complications observed during pandemics may differ from typical influenza seasons, and characterizing variations in influenza-related complications can provide a better understanding of the impact of pandemics and guide appropriate clinical management and planning for the future. Methods. Using a population-based surveillance system, we compared clinical complications using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) discharge diagnosis codes in adults hospitalized with seasonal influenza (n = 5270) or 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (H1N1pdm09; n = 4962). Results. Adults hospitalized with H1N1pdm09 were younger (median age, 47 years) than those with seasonal influenza (median age, 68 years; P < .01), and differed in the frequency of certain underlying medical conditions. Whereas there was similar risk for many influenza-associated complications, after controlling for age and type of underlying medical condition, adults hospitalized with H1N1pdm09 were more likely to have lower respiratory tract complications, shock/sepsis, and organ failure than those with seasonal influenza. They were also more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit, require mechanical ventilation, or die. Young adults, in particular, had 2–4 times the risk of severe outcomes from H1N1pdm09 than persons of the same ages with seasonal influenza. Conclusions. Although H1N1pdm09 was thought of as a relatively mild pandemic, these data highlight the impact of the 2009 pandemic on the risk of severe influenza, especially among younger adults, and the impact this virus may continue to have.

The Human‐Inducible Costimulator Ligand is Polymorphic

Inducible costimulator ligand (ICOSL) is a costimulatory molecule related to B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86). B cells, monocytes, dendritic cells and endothelial cells express ICOSL. Inducible costimulator (ICOS) interacts with ICOSL, and this interaction leads to signals involved in isotype switching and the development of immunological memory. Hitherto, no polymorphisms of this gene have been described. The aim of this study was to reveal variation of the ICOSL gene in normal individuals. All eight exons, except exon 1, were sequenced with flanking introns in 10 healthy blood donors. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and two length polymorphisms were found. One of the SNPs was found in the coding regions of the gene. The base involved was located in exon 3 and caused a conservative amino acid change from valine (GTT) to isoleucine (ATT). Three individuals were heterozygous G/A for the exon polymorphism, while the remaining seven individuals were homozygous for the wildtype G/G. Exon 3 encodes the immunoglobulin variable (IgV)‐like domain of the molecule which is situated outside the cell. This means that the amino acid could be critical for the stability of the molecule or could constitute part of the binding site for ICOS. The results form the basis for further experiments to find possible associations of the alleles to diseases caused by immune dysregulation. Especially, the exon 3 variant is interesting and could play a role for the development of immunological diseases. Besides, it would be interesting to see whether both exon 3 alleles are expressed or only the wildtype allele is functional.

Divide and conquer: strategies to manage a nuclear medicine department during COVID-19.

The Covid-19 outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 30 January 2020. Since then, the virus has spread to affect more countries worldwide. During this period, our nuclear medicine at Singapore General Hospital segregated our staff and patients either by time, space, or both, to minimise contact and prevent the spread of the virus. We also made necessary changes to clinical practices and enforced strict infection control measures. We share our personal experience in managing a nuclear medicine department during this epidemic.

How the COVID-19 pandemic changed the Plastic Surgery activity in a regional referral center in Northen Italy

The Covid 19 epidemic has modified the way that plastic surgeons can treat their patients. At our hospital all elective surgery was canceled and only the more severe cases were admitted. The outpatient department activity has been reduced also. We present the number and diagnoses of patients, treated as in- and out-patients, during seven weeks from the onset of the epidemic, comparing our activity from the lockdown of elective surgery with the numbers and diagnoses observed during the same weeks of last year. Finally we underline the importance of using telemedicine and web-based tools to transmit images of lesions that need the surgeon's evaluation, and can be used by the patient to keep in touch with a doctor during the distressing time of delay of the expected procedure.

CD4–CD8-T cells contribute to the persistence of viral hepatitis by striking a delicate balance in immune modulation

Abstract Viral hepatitis remains the most common cause of liver disease and a major public health problem. Here, we focus on the role of CD4 CD8 double negative T (DN T) cells involved in the mechanisms of viral persistence in hepatitis. C3H/HeJ mice infected with murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) were used to display chronic viral hepatitis. DN T cells dramatically increased in MHV-3 infected mice. Adoptive transfer of DN T cells from MHV-3 infected mice led to a significant increase in mice survival. The DN T cells with production of IFN-γ and IL-2 are able to kill virus-specific CD8+ T cells via the Fas/FasL dependent pathway. The delicate balance of multiple effects of DN T cells may lead to viral persistence in MHV-3 induced hepatitis. In short, our study identified DN T cells contributing to viral persistence in MHV-3 induced hepatitis in C3H/HeJ mice, which provides a rationale for modulating DN T cells for the management of viral hepatitis.

Immediate and long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on delivery of surgical services

BACKGROUND: The ongoing pandemic is having a collateral health effect on delivery of surgical care to millions of patients. Very little is known about pandemic management and effects on other services, including delivery of surgery. METHODS: This was a scoping review of all available literature pertaining to COVID-19 and surgery, using electronic databases, society websites, webinars and preprint repositories. RESULTS: Several perioperative guidelines have been issued within a short time. Many suggestions are contradictory and based on anecdotal data at best. As regions with the highest volume of operations per capita are being hit, an unprecedented number of operations are being cancelled or deferred. No major stakeholder seems to have considered how a pandemic deprives patients with a surgical condition of resources, with patients disproportionally affected owing to the nature of treatment (use of anaesthesia, operating rooms, protective equipment, physical invasion and need for perioperative care). No recommendations exist regarding how to reopen surgical delivery. The postpandemic evaluation and future planning should involve surgical services as an essential part to maintain appropriate surgical care for the population during an outbreak. Surgical delivery, owing to its cross-cutting nature and synergistic effects on health systems at large, needs to be built into the WHO agenda for national health planning. CONCLUSION: Patients are being deprived of surgical access, with uncertain loss of function and risk of adverse prognosis as a collateral effect of the pandemic. Surgical services need a contingency plan for maintaining surgical care in an ongoing or postpandemic phase.

Assessment of quality of life in patients with non-operated pancreatic cancer after videothoracoscopic splanchnicectomy.

INTRODUCTION Pancreatic tumours are a crucial medical issue. The majority of patients report sick in the late stage of carcinoma clinical advancement, which considerably limits the possibility of surgical treatment. Pancreatic cancer patients with no other alternative but palliative treatment constitute a large group. AIM To assess pain intensity levels and quality of life of pancreatic cancer patients after videothoracoscopic splanchnicectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 2001 January and 2010 November in the Department of Thorax, General Surgery and Oncology of the Medical University of Lodz 262 patients with pancreatic tumours were hospitalized. In 121 cases grade 3 and grade 4 tumours were observed. Hundred and twenty-one videothoracoscopic procedures of sympathetic trunk and ganglion excision were performed in 89 patients. RESULTS Before the procedure the pain intensity level according to VAS was 5.66 (3.9-7.2; SD 1.24) in the trial group and 5.46 (4.1-7.1; SD 1.15) in the control group. The quality of life average assessment in both groups did not differ statistically (p = 1.07) and was 46.3 (32-66; SD 0.92) in patients before the operation and in the control group 50.3 (41-63; SD 0.75). On the 7(th) postoperative day the pain intensity on average was 2.33 (1.2-3.9; SD 0.78) and 4.57 (3.6-5.5; SD 0.69) respectively. One week after the procedure the quality of patients' life was estimated at 64.1 (39-83; SD 1.38) and in the control group at 52.2 (42-65; SD 0.71); the differences are significant (p < 0.05). Thirty days after the procedure 12 patients did not take any painkillers (13.5%), and in the others a considerable decrease of the taken drugs was observed. On average, the pain intensity was estimated at 1.78 (0.6-3.6; SD 0.68). The quality of life, on the other hand, improved considerably in relation to the state prior to the procedure, but increased insignificantly in relation to the state on the 7(th) postoperative day to 70.9 (52-88; SD 1.14). CONCLUSIONS Splanchnicectomy is a safe method of cancer pain treatment in patients with advanced pancreatic tumours. Videothoracoscopic excision of visceral nerve thoracic section contributes to the statistically significant decrease of cancer pain intensity and considerably improves the quality of patients' lives.

Predictors of Interpersonal Violence in the Household in Humanitarian Settings: A Systematic Review.

Interpersonal violence against women and children has increasingly been recognized as a public health priority in humanitarian emergencies. However, because the household is generally considered a private sphere, violence between family members remains neglected. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify predictors of household violence in humanitarian emergencies. PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched from January 1, 1998, to February 16, 2016. A predictor was defined as any individual, household, or community-level exposure that increases or decreases the risk associated with physical, sexual, or emotional interpersonal violence between two or more people living together. All studies reporting on quantitative research were eligible for inclusion. Results were analyzed using qualitative synthesis. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed as applicable. The search strategy resulted in 2,587 original records, of which 33 studies met inclusion criteria. Thirty-two of the 33 studies used a cross-sectional design. This was the first known systematic review of predictors of household violence in humanitarian settings. The household framework drew attention to several factors that are associated with violence against both women and children, including conflict exposure, alcohol and drug use, income/economic status, mental health/coping strategies, and limited social support. There is a need for longitudinal research and experimental designs that can better establish temporality between exposures and household violence outcomes, control for confounding, and inform practice. In the interim, programmers and policy makers should try to leverage the predictors identified by this review for integrated violence prevention and response strategies, with the important caveat that ongoing evaluation of such strategies is needed.

Vertebral endplate defects: nomenclature, classification and measurement methods: a scoping review.

PURPOSE To summarize the scope of nomenclature and measurement methods used to document endplate defects in the health sciences literature. METHODS The scoping review followed the York framework and was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. The databases of PubMed, Scopus, Embase and CINAHL were searched using key terms. Screening and selection were conducted by two independent reviewers. A standardized, pilot-tested form was used for extracting data, which were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS The review included 211 studies, originating from 29 countries, with the USA (18.8%) and China (12.26%) as leading contributors. Thirty-four different terms for structural endplate defects were reported, but were never defined in most studies (65%). Of the 34 different terms used, some appeared to represent the same phenomenon, while the same terms were occasionally defined differently between studies. Schmorl's nodes were most commonly investigated (n = 99 studies) and defined similarly across studies, with the main difference relating to whether the indentation (node) was required to have a sclerotic margin. There were also similarities in definitions for endplate sclerosis. However, there was great variability in the definitions of other terms, such as lesions, irregularities, abnormalities, erosions and changes. CONCLUSION With the possible exception of Schmorl's nodes, we lack a common language for effectively communicating structural endplate findings. This review provides a foundation and impetus for standardizing terminology and core measures to improve communication and synthesis of the growing body of endplate research to advance related knowledge. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material (paragraph). Then process the ppt slide as graphical image.

Allelic Variation in the Toll-Like Receptor Adaptor Protein Ticam2 Contributes to SARS-Coronavirus Pathogenesis in Mice

Host genetic variation is known to contribute to differential pathogenesis following infection. Mouse models allow direct assessment of host genetic factors responsible for susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Based on an assessment of early stage lines from the Collaborative Cross mouse multi-parent population, we identified two lines showing highly divergent susceptibilities to SARS-CoV: the resistant CC003/Unc and the susceptible CC053/Unc. We generated 264 F2 mice between these strains, and infected them with SARS-CoV. Weight loss, pulmonary hemorrhage, and viral load were all highly correlated disease phenotypes. We identified a quantitative trait locus of major effect on chromosome 18 (27.1–58.6 Mb) which affected weight loss, viral titer and hemorrhage. Additionally, each of these three phenotypes had distinct quantitative trait loci [Chr 9 (weight loss), Chrs 7 and 12 (virus titer), and Chr 15 (hemorrhage)]. We identified Ticam2, an adaptor protein in the TLR signaling pathways, as a candidate driving differential disease at the Chr 18 locus. Ticam2(−/−) mice were highly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, exhibiting increased weight loss and more pulmonary hemorrhage than control mice. These results indicate a critical role for Ticam2 in SARS-CoV disease, and highlight the importance of host genetic variation in disease responses.

Effect of IBDV infection on the interfollicular epithelium of chicken bursa of Fabricius

In the chicken bursa of Fabricius (BF), the interfollicular epithelium (IFE) consists of cylindrical- and cuboidal-shaped cells. Among the cylindrical-shaped epithelial cells, mucus-producing and caveolin-1 (Cav-1)-expressing cells can be distinguished. Occasionally, the cuboidal-shaped cells also express Cav-1, which suggests that they are precursors of both mucus-producing and Cav-1-expressing cells. Very virulent infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) impedes the differentiation of Cav-1-expressing cells and shifts the differentiation of cuboidal cells towards mucus-producing cells. In control birds exclusively, the IFE surface shows a mucous membrane, but after IBDV infection, the surfaces of both IFE and FAE are also covered by a mucous membrane. After IBDV infection, the cells of FAE also produce mucus, providing evidence for cell transformation. In late postinfection (pi; 28 d pi), the Cav-1 expression returned in the IFE cells, whereas the follicle (the primary lymphoid organ) underwent atrophy. The appearance of the renewed Cav-1-positive cells is similar to that of the normal basal cell, but they randomly locate in different levels of IFE, suggesting the loss of epithelial polarity. Between days 2 and 7 pi, the Cav-1 expression in the endothelial cells of the cortico-medullary capillary web is variable, which may explain the hemorrhage in several infected birds. The IBDV infection stops the Cav-1 expression and subsequently the cholesterol efflux into the bursal lumen. In the infected birds, the high cholesterol level may further worsen the clinical syndrome of IBDV.

Clinical utility of a near patient care microarray based diagnostic test for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infections.

UNLABELLED In primary care medicine, establishing a diagnosis of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections is usually based on clinical history and physical examination as well as a consideration of time of the year and circulating respiratory viruses in the community. METHODS We tested the potential clinical samples using the automated molecular assay which included rapid influenza diagnostic test, Rapid Immunochromatographic Antigen Test, Verigene Respiratory Virus Plus Nucleic Acid Test, BD Veritor(TM) System for Rapid Detection of RSV in the paediatric setting for diagnosis of influenza and respiratory syntactical virus infections when testing was done by the paediatrician seeing the patient. RESULTS Principally, with respect influenza virus specificity and sensitivity for RIAT were 100% and 68.8%; compared to 100% and 100%, respectively for RV(+). The specificity and sensitivity for 92.23% and 98% for BD Veritor(TM) System for Rapid Detection of RSV as compared to 96.6% and 98.42% for RIDT. CONCLUSION Therefore, this study confirms the clinical utility of RV(+) in the pediatric setting.

Risques viraux émergents en transfusion sanguine

During the last 20 years, the safety of blood products increased dramatically with regard to the infectious risk and notably to that represented by retroviruses (HIV and HTLV) and hepatitis B and C viruses. The aim of this review is to identify the residual and emergent viral threats that could be responsible for the occurring of new contaminations in the receivers of blood products. Beside many other viruses (HHV-8, erythrovirus B19, hepatitis A and E viruses…), a special attention has been paid to emerging arbovirus diseases (West Nile virus infection, dengue, chikungunya) that threaten to occur in the French metropolitan area following the implantation in Europe of the mosquito Aedes albopictus, the main vector of dengue and chikungunya in temperate regions. Another blood-linked risk, notably in United Kingdom and France, is the prion agent responsible for the variant form of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The review is concluded by a brief overview of the measures aimed to control these emergences, including the exclusion of at-risk donors, the diagnostic tests able to detect a specific agent, the leukocyte reduction of labile blood products, and the physical or chemical treatments aiming the nonspecific inactivation of infectious agents potentially present in blood without impairing significantly the physiological properties of blood compounds. The ability to control prospectively the new viral risks linked to blood products is a challenge for the preservation of the confidence of both clinicians and receivers in the safety of blood transfusion.

Intravenous Amide Anesthetics to Treat Pain Associated with Renal Colic in the Emergency Department: a Systematic Review.

Introduction Renal colic affects 12% of the U.S. population, accounting for nearly 1% of emergency department (ED) visits. Current recommendations advocate narcotic-limiting multimodal analgesia regimens. The objective of this review is to determine if in patients with renal colic (Population), intravenous (IV) amide anesthetics (Intervention) result in better pain control, lower requirements for rescue analgesia, or less adverse medication effects (outcome) compared to placebo, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or opiates (Comparisons). Methods Scholarly databases and relevant bibliographies were searched using a pre-designed systematic review protocol and registered with PROSPERO. Inclusion criteria were: (1) randomized clinical trial (RCT), (2) age ≥ 18 years, (3) confirmed or presumed renal colic, (4) amide anesthetic administered IV. Eligible comparison groups included: placebo, conventional therapy, acetaminophen, NSAID, or opiate. The primary outcome was pain intensity at baseline, 30, 60, and 120 minutes. Trial quality was graded, and risk-of-bias was assessed. Results Of the 3930 identified references, 4 RCTs (479 participants) were included. One trial (n=240) reported improved analgesia with IV lidocaine (LidoIV) plus metoclopramide, compared to morphine. All other trials reported unchanged or less analgesia compared to placebo, ketorolac, or fentanyl. Very severe heterogeneity (I2= 88%) precluded pooling data. Conclusion Current evidence precludes drawing a firm conclusion on the efficacy or superiority of LidoIV over traditional therapies for ED patients with renal colic. Evidence suggests LidoIV may be an effective non-opiate analgesic alliterative; however, it's efficacy may not exceed that of NSAIDs or opiates. Further study is needed to validate the potential improved efficacy of LidoIV plus metoclopramide.

A global perspective on hepatitis B‐related single nucleotide polymorphisms and evolution during human migration

Genome‐wide association studies have indicated that human leukocyte antigen (HLA)‐DP and HLA‐DQ play roles in persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Asia. To understand the evolution of HBV‐related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and to correlate these SNPs with chronic HBV infection among different populations, we conducted a global perspective study on hepatitis‐related SNPs. We selected 12 HBV‐related SNPs on the HLA locus and two HBV and three hepatitis C virus immune‐related SNPs for analysis. Five nasopharyngeal carcinoma‐related SNPs served as controls. All SNP data worldwide from 26 populations were downloaded from 1,000 genomes. We found a dramatic difference in the allele frequency in most of the HBV‐ and HLA‐related SNPs in East Asia compared to the other continents. A sharp change in allele frequency in 8 of 12 SNPs was found between Bengali populations in Bangladesh and Chinese Dai populations in Xishuangbanna, China (P < 0.001); these areas represent the junction of South and East Asia. For the immune‐related SNPs, significant changes were found after leaving Africa. Most of these genes shifted from higher expression genotypes in Africa to lower expression genotypes in either Europe or South Asia (P < 0.001). During this two‐stage adaptation, immunity adjusted toward a weak immune response, which could have been a survival strategy during human migration to East Asia. The prevalence of chronic HBV infection in Africa is as high as in Asia; however, the HBV‐related SNP genotypes are not present in Africa, and so the genetic mechanism of chronic HBV infection in Africa needs further exploration. Conclusion: Two stages of genetic changes toward a weak immune response occurred when humans migrated out of Africa. These changes could be a survival strategy for avoiding cytokine storms and surviving in new environments. (Hepatology Communications 2017;1:1005–1013)

Antimicrobial resistance: the good, the bad, and the ugly

As the Royal Society for Biology (RSB) was forming 10 years ago, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was being heralded as the next threat with a magnitude on a par with global warming. Just a few years later, in 2016, Jim O'Neill's report was published laying out recommendations for tackling drug-resistant infections globally. Where are we now, and what are the challenges ahead? As a slow burner, how will the impact of AMR compare against the recent rapid devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic, and how can we channel some of the good things that come from it (like the awareness and technique of effective hand hygiene) to help us combat AMR speedily and definitively?

Amino terminus of the SARS coronavirus protein 3a elicits strong, potentially protective humoral responses in infected patients.

The 3a protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus is expressed and transported to the plasma membrane in tissue cells of infected patients. Its short N-terminal ectodomain was found to elicit strong humoral responses in half of the patients who had recovered from SARS. The ectodomain-specific antibodies from the convalescent-phase plasma readily recognized and induced destruction of 3a-expressing cells in the presence of the human complement system, demonstrating their potential ability to provide immune protection by recognizing and eliminating SARS coronavirus-infected cells that express the target protein. In addition, when coupled to a carrier protein, the ectodomain peptide elicited 3a-specific antibodies in mice and rabbit at high titres. These results showed that the N terminus of the 3a protein is highly immunogenic and elicits potentially protective humoral responses in infected patients. Therefore, the short extracellular domain may be a valuable immunogen in the development of a vaccine for infectious SARS.

Combinatorial RNAi: A Winning Strategy for the Race Against Evolving Targets?

The ability to use double-stranded RNA to inhibit gene expression sequence-specifically (RNA interference, or RNAi) is currently revolutionizing science and medicine alike. Numerous pre-clinical studies are evaluating RNAi as a novel therapeutic modality in the battle against gain-of-function autosomal dominant diseases, cancer, and viral infections. One emerging concern is that RNAi mono-therapies might ultimately fail to control viruses that can escape silencing by mutation and/or RNAi suppression. Thus, sophisticated strategies are being developed that aim to avert viral resistance by combining RNAi effectors with each other or with further gene expression inhibitors. Several reports already validate this new concept of “combinatorial RNAi” (coRNAi) and illustrate its versatility by describing co-expression of RNAi triggers directed against single or multiple, viral or cellular, targets. Other studies document the successful delivery of these triggers with additional RNA- or protein-based silencers. Moreover, vectors have been engineered to blend RNAi-mediated gene inhibition with conventional gene replacement strategies. Collectively, these efforts open up exciting new therapeutic avenues but could also augment the inherent risks of RNAi technology, including immune responses, off-targeting, and oversaturation of endogenous pathways. Here, we critically review all coRNAi strategies and discuss the requirements for their transition into clinical application.

Clinical features and outcome of HIV/SARS‐CoV‐2 coinfected patients in The Bronx, New York city

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease with millions of people have been infected. However, there is limited data regarding clinical features, disease courses and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Herein, we presented the demographic data, clinical characteristics and outcomes of nine confirmed COVID-19 patients with HIV infection admitted to our hospital located in south Bronx, New York City. Our study revealed very high mortality rate at 78%, which may contradict to the hypothesis that immunosuppression from HIV infection prevents against severe COVID-19. More research is needed to determine the impact of HIV on the clinical course of COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Indirubin, a small molecular deriving from connectivity map (CMAP) screening, ameliorates obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction by enhancing brown adipose thermogenesis and white adipose browning

BACKGROUND: Obesity occurs when the body’s energy intake is constantly greater than its energy consumption and the pharmacological enhancing the activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and (or) browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) has been considered promising strategies to treat obesity. METHODS: In this study, we took a multi-pronged approach to screen UCP1 activators, including in silico predictions, in vitro assays, as well as in vivo experiments. RESULTS: Base on Connectivity MAP (CMAP) screening, we obtained multiple drugs that possess a remarkably correlating gene expression pattern to that of enhancing activity in BAT and (or) sWAT signature. Particularly, we focused on a previously unreported drug-indirubin, a compound obtained from the Indigo plant, which is now mainly used for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In the current study, our results shown that indirubin could enhance the BAT activity, as evidenced by up-regulated Ucp1 expression and enhanced mitochondrial respiratory function in vitro cellular model. Furthermore, indirubin treatment restrained high-fat diet (HFD)-induced body weight gain, improved glucose homeostasis and ameliorated hepatic steatosis which were associated with the increase of energy expenditure in the mice model. Moreover, we revealed that indirubin treatment increased BAT activity by promoting thermogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis in BAT and induced browning of subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue (sWAT) of mice under HFD. Besides, our results indicated that indirubin induced UCP1 expression in brown adipocytes, at least in part, via activation of PKA and p38MAPK signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our results clearly show that as an effective BAT (as well as beige cells) activator, indirubin may have a protective effect on the prevention and treatment of obesity and its complications.

Persistent infection of cultured cells with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) results from the epigenetic expression of the MHV receptor.

The A59 strain of murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) can cause persistent infection of 17C1-1 cells and other murine cell lines. Persistently infected cultures released large amounts of virus (10(7) to 10(8) PFU/ml) and were resistant to superinfection with MHV but not to infection with unrelated Semliki Forest and vesicular stomatitis viruses. The culture medium from persistently infected cultures did not contain a soluble inhibitor such as interferon that protected uninfected cells from infection by MHV or vesicular stomatitis virus. The persistent infection was cured if fewer than 100 cells were transferred during subculturing, and such cured cultures were susceptible to reinfection and the reestablishment of persistent infection. Cultures of 17C1-1 cells that had been newly cloned from single cells consisted of a mixture of MHV-resistant and -susceptible cells. 17C1-1/#97 cells, which were cured by subcloning after 97 passages of a persistently infected culture over a 1-year period, contained 5 to 10% of their population as susceptible cells, while 17C1-1/#402 cells, which were cured by subcloning after 402 passages over a 3-year period, had less than 1% susceptible cells. Susceptibility to infection correlated with the expression of MHV receptor glycoprotein (MHVR [Bgp1a]). Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with antibody to MHVR showed that 17C1-1/#97 cells contained a small fraction of MHVR-expressing cells. These MHVR-expressing cells were selectively eliminated within 24 h after challenge with MHV-A59, and pretreatment of 17C1-1/#97 cells with monoclonal antibody CC1, which binds to the N-terminal domain of MHVR, blocked infection. We conclude that the subpopulation of MHVR-expressing cells were infected and killed in acutely or persistently infected cultures, while the subpopulation of MHVR-nonexpressing cells survived and proliferated. The subpopulation of MHVR-negative cells produced a small proportion of progeny cells that expressed MHVR and became infected, thereby maintaining the persistent infection as a steady-state carrier culture. Thus, in 17C1-1 cell cultures, the unstable or epigenetic expression of MHVR permitted the establishment of a persistent, chronic infection.

The Stanford Hall consensus statement for post-COVID-19 rehabilitation.

The highly infectious and pathogenic novel coronavirus (CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, has emerged causing a global pandemic. Although COVID-19 predominantly affects the respiratory system, evidence indicates a multisystem disease which is frequently severe and often results in death. Long-term sequelae of COVID-19 are unknown, but evidence from previous CoV outbreaks demonstrates impaired pulmonary and physical function, reduced quality of life and emotional distress. Many COVID-19 survivors who require critical care may develop psychological, physical and cognitive impairments. There is a clear need for guidance on the rehabilitation of COVID-19 survivors. This consensus statement was developed by an expert panel in the fields of rehabilitation, sport and exercise medicine (SEM), rheumatology, psychiatry, general practice, psychology and specialist pain, working at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre, Stanford Hall, UK. Seven teams appraised evidence for the following domains relating to COVID-19 rehabilitation requirements: pulmonary, cardiac, SEM, psychological, musculoskeletal, neurorehabilitation and general medical. A chair combined recommendations generated within teams. A writing committee prepared the consensus statement in accordance with the appraisal of guidelines research and evaluation criteria, grading all recommendations with levels of evidence. Authors scored their level of agreement with each recommendation on a scale of 0-10. Substantial agreement (range 7.5-10) was reached for 36 recommendations following a chaired agreement meeting that was attended by all authors. This consensus statement provides an overarching framework assimilating evidence and likely requirements of multidisciplinary rehabilitation post COVID-19 illness, for a target population of active individuals, including military personnel and athletes.

Long-term outcome of colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis for Crohn's colitis.

BACKGROUND Ileorectal anastomosis is an important surgical option for patients with Crohn's colitis with relative rectal sparing. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to audit outcomes of ileorectal anastomosis for Crohn's and factors associated with proctectomy and reoperation. DESIGN This retrospective study involved a chart review and contacting patients. SETTINGS Patients with Crohn's colitis who had an ileorectal anastomosis were identified from the Mount Sinai Hospital Inflammatory Bowel Disease Database. PATIENTS Demographics, operative and perioperative outcomes, and reoperative data were collected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Five- and 10-year Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for survival from proctectomy and Crohn's-related revisional surgery. Cox proportional hazards models were used to model the hazards of proctectomy and Crohn's-related revision on the clinical characteristics of patients. RESULTS Eighty-one patients had an ileorectal anastomosis for Crohn's disease from 1982 to 2010. The most common indications for surgery were failed medical management (60/81, 74.1%) and a stricture causing obstruction (14/81, 17.3%). Seventy-seven percent (n = 62) had a 1-stage procedure, whereas 23% (n = 19) had a 2-stage procedure (colectomy followed by ileorectal anastomosis). The overall anastomotic leak rate was 7.4% (n = 6). Fifty-six patients had a functioning ileorectal anastomosis at the time of follow-up. At 5 and 10 years, 87% (95% CI: 75.5-93.3) and 72.2% (95% CI: 55.8-83.4) of individuals had a functioning ileorectal anastomosis. Eighteen patients required proctectomy for poor symptom control, whereas 11 patients required a small-bowel resection plus redo-ileorectal anastomosis. The mean time to proctectomy from the original ileorectal anastomosis was 88.3 months (SD = 62.1). Smoking was associated with both proctectomy (HR 3.93 (95% CI: 1.46-10.55)) and reoperative surgery (HR 2.12 (95% CI: 0.96-4.72)). LIMITATIONS : This study was retrospective. CONCLUSIONS Ileorectal anastomosis is an appropriate operation for selected patients with Crohn's colitis with sparing of the rectum. However, patients must be counseled that the reoperation rate and/or proctectomy rate is approximately 30%.

An educational programme for nursing college staff and students during a MERS- coronavirus outbreak in Saudi Arabia

BACKGROUND: The Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus is a serious and emerging issue in Saudi Arabia and the world. A response was required to reduce possible disease transmission between the hospital and university. College of Nursing academic staff developed a programme in response to the educational and emotional needs of participants. METHODS: A MERS-CoV Task Force responded to the rapidly unfolding epidemic. The aim was to find out what nursing staff and nursing students in the college knew about MERS- CoV. While most gaps in knowledge were addressed after an intense information seminar, other learning needs were identified and responded to. The Task Force developed mandatory information sessions for all nursing faculty, students and staff. All staff were informed by email, letters and posters. There are 28 faculty staff, 84 support staff and 480 students in the College of Nursing. The information settings all took place within the College of Nursing, Princess Nourah University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Questionnaires were given to faculty, students and staff to understand their baseline knowledge. After the sessions, faculty, students and staff were asked about what was learned through the sessions, and what educational needs still needed to be addressed. Approval was sought and received by the Ethics Committee for the College of Nursing. Participants completed informed consent forms and the voluntary nature of the study was explained. RESULTS: The total number of people attending the education sessions was133, including 65 students. 18 faculty members attended and 57 support staff. Data was gathered on gaps in participant knowledge and a plan was developed to address the gaps. Policies were established around student participation in clinical and return to work practices for staff with any symptoms. CONCLUSION: In hospitals there is above average risk for exposure to infectious diseases. Student nurses travel between hospital and university, with the capacity to act as a conduit of pathogens to large, susceptible populations. Nursing colleges must respond thoroughly to protect students and staff and prevent spread of disease into the university community in the midst of an epidemic.

Chicken GRIFIN: Structural characterization in crystals and in solution

Abstract Despite its natural abundance in lenses of vertebrates the physiological function(s) of the galectin-related inter-fiber protein (GRIFIN) is (are) still unclear. The same holds true for the significance of the unique interspecies (fish/birds vs mammals) variability in the capacity to bind lactose. In solution, ultracentrifugation and small angle X-ray scattering (at concentrations up to 9 mg/mL) characterize the protein as compact and stable homodimer without evidence for aggregation. The crystal structure of chicken (C-)GRIFIN at seven pH values from 4.2 to 8.5 is reported, revealing compelling stability. Binding of lactose despite the Arg71Val deviation from the sequence signature of galectins matched the otherwise canonical contact pattern with thermodynamics of an enthalpically driven process. Upon lactose accommodation, the side chain of Arg50 is shifted for hydrogen bonding to the 3-hydroxyl of glucose. No evidence for a further ligand-dependent structural alteration was obtained in solution by measuring hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometrically in peptic fingerprints. The introduction of the Asn48Lys mutation, characteristic for mammalian GRIFINs that have lost lectin activity, lets labeled C-GRIFIN maintain capacity to stain tissue sections. Binding is no longer inhibitable by lactose, as seen for the wild-type protein. These results establish the basis for detailed structure-activity considerations and are a step to complete the structural description of all seven members of the galectin network in chicken.

Causes and Implications of Codon Usage Bias in RNA Viruses

Choice of synonymous codons depends on nucleotide/dinucleotide composition of the genome (termed mutational pressure) and relative abundance of tRNAs in a cell (translational pressure). Mutational pressure is commonly simplified to genomic GC content; however mononucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies in different genomes or mRNAs may vary significantly, especially in RNA viruses. A series of in silico shuffling algorithms were developed to account for these features and analyze the relative impact of mutational pressure components on codon usage bias in RNA viruses. Total GC content was a poor descriptor of viral genome composition and causes of codon usage bias. Genomic nucleotide content was the single most important factor of synonymous codon usage. Moreover, the choice between compatible amino acids (e.g., leucine and isoleucine) was strongly affected by genomic nucleotide composition. Dinucleotide composition at codon positions 2-3 had additional effect on codon usage. Together with mononucleotide composition bias, it could explain almost the entire codon usage bias in RNA viruses. On the other hand, strong dinucleotide content bias at codon position 3-1 found in some viruses had very little effect on codon usage. A hypothetical innate immunity sensor for CpG in RNA could partially explain the codon usage bias, but due to dependence of virus translation upon biased host translation machinery, experimental studies are required to further explore the source of dinucleotide bias in RNA viruses.

Linear Time Construction of Indexable Founder Block Graphs

We introduce a compact pangenome representation based on an optimal segmentation concept that aims to reconstruct founder sequences from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Such founder sequences have the feature that each row of the MSA is a recombination of the founders. Several linear time dynamic programming algorithms have been previously devised to optimize segmentations that induce founder blocks that then can be concatenated into a set of founder sequences. All possible concatenation orders can be expressed as a founder block graph. We observe a key property of such graphs: if the node labels (founder segments) do not repeat in the paths of the graph, such graphs can be indexed for efficient string matching. We call such graphs segment repeat-free founder block graphs. We give a linear time algorithm to construct a segment repeat-free founder block graph given an MSA. The algorithm combines techniques from the founder segmentation algorithms (Cazaux et al. SPIRE 2019) and fully-functional bidirectional Burrows-Wheeler index (Belazzougui and Cunial, CPM 2019). We derive a succinct index structure to support queries of arbitrary length in the paths of the graph. Experiments on an MSA of SAR-CoV-2 strains are reported. An MSA of size $410\times 29811$ is compacted in one minute into a segment repeat-free founder block graph of 3900 nodes and 4440 edges. The maximum length and total length of node labels is 12 and 34968, respectively. The index on the graph takes only $3\%$ of the size of the MSA.

Nutritional management and support in COVID-19: Emerging nutrivigilance.

Corona virus disease (COVID-19) emerged as an epidemic from China, with quick spread globally. The disease can lead to serious problems, like pneumonia or even death especially among vulnerable people with existing health conditions. Its treatment and management require huge efforts from medical professionals often at the cost of their own health and life. Nutrition is the epicenter for the management of such diseases which works synergistically with the medical treatment for quick and better recovery. It has been associated with great human and economic toll and it is still not contained. Currently over two million people are affected and over 300,000 deaths globally. However, due to its newness and unfamiliarity, the understanding of this novel virus is still evolving. This viral infection poses numerous metabolic challenges to those severely affected and addressing them is a key to better outcomes. Medical nutritional therapy is thus among the mainstay of core components of comprehensive treatment measures for patients with COVID-19. This manuscript therefore aims to highlight the role of nutritional management and support in covid-19 disease.

TNF-α − 308 G/A and IFN-γ + 874 A/T gene polymorphisms in Saudi patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis

BACKGROUND: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is well linked with immunogenetic factors. This study was undertaken to test the association of TNF-α − 308 and IFN-γ + 874 gene polymorphisms with the susceptibility of Leishmania (L) species among CL patients in central region of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This is a case-control study involved 169 Saudi subjects with different L. species and 199 healthy controls from central region of Saudi Arabia. All subjects were characterized by TNF-α − 308 G/A and IFN-γ + 874 A/T gene polymorphisms using PCR. RESULTS: Evaluation of genotyping and allelic frequency of TNF-α − 308 G/A in different L. species showed no significant association compared to controls (p > 0.05). Except, in cases of L. tropica that showed significantly higher TNF-α − 308 A versus G allele frequency (p = 0.0004). Evaluation of genotyping of IFN-γ + 874 (TT versus AA+AT recessive) and allelic frequency of IFN-γ + 874 (T versus A) showed significant higher in L. major and also in total CL cases as compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05). Furthermore, a strong association was observed between the susceptibility of L. major, L. tropica or total CL cases with synergistically combined high TNF-α 308/INF-γ 874 alleles. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report that shows the gene polymorphisms of TNF-α − 308 G/A and IFN-γ + 874 A/T in Saudi patients with different L. species infections. Data showed that the TNF-α-308 G/A gene polymorphism is not associated with the susceptibility of CL in Saudi subjects. The only correlation was found in between A versus G allelic frequency in L. tropica. Importantly, IFN-γ + 874 A/T polymorphism was found to be associated with the susceptibility of L. major and also with total CL subjects. Moreover, data from synergistically combined high TNF-α 308/INF-γ 874 alleles strongly suggest their potential role in the susceptibility of leishmania infection.

Personal economic anxiety in response to COVID-19

The economic effects of COVID-19 have been far-reaching. Using a sample of adults from the United States (n = 513), the present study examined demographic and individual correlates of anxiety about financial hardship on March 17th, 2020, the day after historic stock market drops in response to the emerging COVID-19 crisis. Confirmatory factor analysis models determined that a unidimensional approach best accounted for covariation among types of economic anxiety. Zero-order and semi-partial correlations with economic anxiety were estimated. Younger adults tended to report greater anxiety than older adults. Black respondents reported significantly more anxiety, whereas respondents without children living at home reported less anxiety. Low collective self-esteem, low conscientiousness, and low openness to experience were associated with greater economic anxiety. High neuroticism, perceived vulnerability to disease, and belongingness stemming from large group activities also were associated with greater anxiety. The current study provides a first glance at individual differences in understanding who may experience economic anxiety due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Inequalities in air pollution exposure are increasing in the United States

Exposure to ambient air pollution contributes substantially to the global burden of disease, and in 2015, ambient exposure to PM2.5 (fine particles with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 m) was the fifth-ranking risk factor of mortality globally. We analyzed data from the US zip code tabulation areas (N=32047) for 2000-2016 and found strong evidence of inequalities in exposure to PM2.5 among both racial/ethnic and income groups. Most alarming, we found that these inequalities have been increasing over time. From 2010 to 2016 inequalities in the exposure to PM2.5 levels above 8 g/m3 across racial/ethnic, and income groups increased by factors of 1.6 and 4.0 respectively. As shown in our powerful map visualizations, these results indicate that air pollution regulations must not only decrease PM2.5 concentration levels nationwide but also prioritize reducing environmental injustice across the US.

Representation of molecular structures with persistent homology for machine learning applications in chemistry

Machine learning and high-throughput computational screening have been valuable tools in accelerated first-principles screening for the discovery of the next generation of functionalized molecules and materials. The application of machine learning for chemical applications requires the conversion of molecular structures to a machine-readable format known as a molecular representation. The choice of such representations impacts the performance and outcomes of chemical machine learning methods. Herein, we present a new concise molecular representation derived from persistent homology, an applied branch of mathematics. We have demonstrated its applicability in a high-throughput computational screening of a large molecular database (GDB-9) with more than 133,000 organic molecules. Our target is to identify novel molecules that selectively interact with CO(2). The methodology and performance of the novel molecular fingerprinting method is presented and the new chemically-driven persistence image representation is used to screen the GDB-9 database to suggest molecules and/or functional groups with enhanced properties.

Coronaviruses in polarized epithelial cells.

Coronaviruses have a marked tropism for epithelial cells. In this paper the interactions of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) with epithelial cells are compared. Porcine (LLC-PK1) and murine (mTAL) epithelial cells were grown on permeable supports. By inoculation from the apical or basolateral side both TGEV and MHV-A59 were found to enter the polarized cells only through the apical membrane. The release of newly synthesized TGEV from LLC-PK1 cells occurred preferentially from the apical plasma membrane domain, as evidenced by the accumulation of viral proteins and infectivity in the apical culture fluid. In contrast, MHV was released preferentially from the basolateral membrane of mTAL cells. The apical release of TGEV and the basolateral release of MHV may explain the in vivo establishment of a local and systemic infection, respectively.

French West Indies castaway children as a result of the covid‐19 outbreak

I read with interest the submission of Haward et al. (1) dealing with the pediatrical ethics issues during this Covid‐19 outbreak. I was particularly sensitive to the chapter dedicated to neonatal which highlighted very clearly the indirect consequences of this pandemic on the paediatric population. I would like to insist on the situation in the West Indies. The numbers of adult's vital distress sharply increase the need for intensive care beds. Even the great majority of pediatric intensive care units have provided equipment and staff to support the adult units (2).

Perspectives on the death investigation during the COVID-19 pandemic

Abstract The pandemic of COVID-19 caused by 2019-nCoV outbreaks in most of the countries, which has subsequently spread rapidly and become a pandemic worldwide. Due to the strong infectivity of COVID-19 and lack of experience of performing an autopsy to infectious disease-induced death, the pandemic created some challenges for forensic practitioners. In this article, we summarize the experience of how we handle the confirmed or suspected infectious cases, and give some perspectives for the future.

National Smoking Rates Correlate Inversely with COVID-19 Mortality

ABSTRACT Introduction: Recent studies show cigarette smokers are markedly under-represented among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in over a dozen countries. It is unclear if this may be related to confounding factors such as age distribution, access to care, and inaccurate records. We hypothesized that these concerns could be avoided by studying smoking prevalence in relation to COVID-19 mortality. Since climate has been identified as a factor in COVID-19, we studied groups of countries with relatively comparable temperatures. Methods: The 20 hottest and 20 coldest countries in the Johns Hopkins Mortality Analysis database with a minimum mortality rate of .3 deaths/100,000 were selected on the basis of the average temperatures of their largest city. Mortality rates were determined as of May 1, 2020 and correlated with national smoking rate adjusting for sex ratio, obesity, temperature, and elderly population. Results: A highly significant inverse correlation between current daily smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality rate was noted for the group of hot countries (R=-.718, p = .0002), cold countries (R=-.567, p=.0046), and the combined group (R=-.324, p=.0207). However, after adjustments only the regression for hot countries and the combined group remained significant. In hot countries, for each percentage point increase in smoking rate mortality decreased by .147 per 100,000 population (95% CI .102- 192, p=.0066). This resulted in mortality rates several-fold elevated in the countries with the lowest smoking rates relative to the highest smoking rates. In the combined group, mortality decreased by .257 per 100,000 population (95% CI .175-.339, p=.0034). Discussion: These findings add support to the finding of an inverse relationship between current smoking and seriously symptomatic COVID-19. However, we conclude that the difference in mortality between the highest and lowest smoking countries appears too large to be due primarily to the effects of smoking per se. A potentially beneficial effect of smoking is surprising, but compatible with a number of hypothetical mechanisms which deserve exploration: 1) Studies show smoking alters ACE2 expression which may affect COVID-19 infection or its progression to serious lung pathology. 2) Nicotine has anti-inflammatory activity and also appears to alter ACE2 expression. 3) Nitric oxide in cigarette smoke is known to be effective in treating pulmonary hypertension and has shown in vitro antiviral effects including against SARS-CoV-2. 4) Smoking has complicated effects on the immune system involving both up and down regulation, any of which might alone or in concert antagonize progression of COVID-19. 5) Smokers are exposed to hot vapors which may stimulate immunity in the respiratory tract by various heat-related mechanisms (e.g. heat shock proteins). Studies of steam and sauna treatments have shown efficacy in other viral respiratory conditions. At this time there is no clear evidence that smoking is protective against COVID-19, so the established recommendations to avoid smoking should be emphasized. The interaction of smoking and COVID-19 will only be reliably determined by carefully designed prospective study, and there is reason to believe that there are unknown confounds that may be spuriously suggesting a protective effect of smoking. However, the magnitude of the apparent inverse association of COVID-19 and smoking and its myriad clinical implications suggest the importance of further investigation.

Effect of Process Parameters on Weld Spatter in Robotic Welding

Abstract This research deals with the investigation of a real-life industrial problem of excessive weld spatter produced in an automated welding robot cell using gas metal arc welding process. Spatter generation was attributed to a number of sources including incorrect machine settings, surface contaminants, and erratic wire feeding. Random variation of different welding process parameters such as voltage, wire feed speed, and torch travel angle, affected spatter production, which served as a motivation to embark on a systematic study involving design of experiments. A total of ten most significant parameters were identified through a brainstorming process involving robotic cell operators, section managers, and subject matter experts. Using the selected ten parameters, preliminary experiments were conducted to determine the appropriate operating range for each process parameter that has the most significant impact on weld spatter. An Orthogonal L16 Array from Taguchi’s designs was chosen with four parameters at 4-levels, four parameters at 2-levels, and two parameters were held constant at 1-level. Following the establishment of a defined set of parameters and corresponding ranges of values, a series of designed experiments were conducted to measure the effect of process parameters on weld spatter production. During each designed experiment, six different responses were recorded that included, the weight of wire used, the weight of the weld bead deposited, the mass of spatter collected in a tray, audio signals generated, the spatter particle count using ImageJ, and the quality of the weld bead. The optimal process parameters identified in this study were of practical significance, and as such the recommended parameters were implemented in the industry.

Biological Invasions Across Spatial Scales: Intercontinental, Regional, and Local Dispersal of Cladoceran Zooplankton

The frequency of dispersal of invertebrates among lakes depends upon perspective and spatial scale. Effective passive dispersal requires both the transport of propagules and the establishment of populations large enough to be detected. At a global scale, biogeographic patterns of cladoceran zooplankton species suggest that effective dispersal among continents was originally rare, but greatly increased in the past century with expanded commerce. Genetic analysis allows some reconstruction of past dispersal events. Allozyme and mitochondrial DNA comparisons among New World and Old-World populations of several exotic cladocerans have provided estimates for likely source populations of colonists, their dispersal corridors, and timing of earlier dispersal events. Detecting the Old-World tropical exotic Daphnia lumholtzi early in its invasion of North America has allowed detailed analysis of its spatial spread. Twelve years of collection records indicate a rapid invasion of reservoirs in the United States, by both regional spread and long-distance jumps to new regions. Combining landscape features with zooplankton surveys from south-central US reservoirs revealed higher colonization rates of D. lumholtzi at lower landscape positions, a result which can be explained by either greater propagule load or by higher susceptibility of these downstream reservoirs. Because invaded reservoirs provide a source of propagules for nearby floodplain ponds, the rarity of this species in ponds suggests limitation by local environments. Such analyses of invading species over multiple spatial scales allow a better understanding of ecological processes governing invasion dynamics.

Economic analysis of healthcare-associated infection prevention and control interventions in medical and surgical units: Systematic review using a discounting approach

BACKGROUND: Nosocomial or healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) are associated with a financial burden that affects both patients and healthcare institutions worldwide. The clinical best care practices (CBPs) of hand hygiene, hygiene and sanitation, screening, and basic and additional precautions aim to reduce this burden. The COVID-19 pandemic has confirmed these four CBPs are critically important prevention practices that limit the spread of HCAIs. AIM: This paper conducted a systematic review of economic evaluations related to these four CBPs using a discounting approach. METHODS: We searched for articles published between 2000 and 2019. We included economic evaluations of infection prevention and control of Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhoea, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. Results were analyzed with: cost-minimization, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-benefit and cost-consequence analyses. Articles were assessed for quality. RESULTS: A total of 11 898 articles were screened and seven were included. Most studies (4/7) were of overall moderate quality. All studies demonstrated cost effectiveness of CBPs. The average yearly net cost savings from the CBPs ranged from $252 847 (2019 $CAD) to $1 691 823 depending on the rate of discount (3% and 8%). The average incremental benefit cost ratio of CBPs varied from 2.48 to 7.66. CONCLUSION: In order to make efficient use of resources and maximize health benefits, ongoing research in the economic evaluation of infection control should be carried out to support evidence-based healthcare policy decisions.

SARS-CoV-2 infection in farmed minks, the Netherlands, April and May 2020

Respiratory disease and increased mortality occurred in minks on two farms in the Netherlands, with interstitial pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in organ and swab samples. On both farms, at least one worker had coronavirus disease-associated symptoms before the outbreak. Variations in mink-derived viral genomes showed between-mink transmission and no infection link between the farms. Inhalable dust contained viral RNA, indicating possible exposure of workers. One worker is assumed to have attracted the virus from mink.

Behavior of a new long-chain cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive used for mesh fixation in hernia repair.

BACKGROUND Synthetic tissue adhesives (TA) are sometimes used in hernia repair surgery. This study compares the use of a new, noncommercial, long-chain cyanoacrylate (n-octyl) TA and Ifabond for mesh fixation. MATERIALS AND METHODS In two implant models in the rabbit, expanded polytetrafluorethylene meshes were fixed to the parietal peritoneum using a TA or tacks (intraperitoneal model), or polypropylene meshes used to repair partial abdominal wall defects were fixed with a TA or sutures (extraperitoneal model). Animals were euthanized 14 or 90 d postsurgery and implant specimens were processed for microscopy (labeling of macrophages and apoptotic cells), peritoneal fluid and biomechanical strength testing. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) were determinated in peritoneal fluid. RESULTS Mesothelial cell deposition on the intraperitoneal implants fixed using the new TA and Ifabond was adequate and similar IL-6 and TNF-α levels were detected in these implants. Intraperitoneal meshes fixed with tacks showed IL-6 overexpression. Three months after surgery, macrophage and apoptotic cell rates were higher for the intraperitoneal implants fixed with Ifabond versus the new TA or tacks. In the extraperitoneal model, reduced macrophage and cell damage responses were observed in the meshes fixed with sutures versus both TA. Tensile strengths were greater for the tacks versus TA in the intraperitoneal implants and similar for the sutures and TA in the extraperitoneal implants (90 d). CONCLUSIONS Both TA showed a good cell response in both models. Their use in an intraperitoneal location resulted in reduced tensile strength compared with the tacks. However, strengths were comparable when extraperitoneal implants were fixed with these adhesives or sutures.

Mapping genetic determinants of viral traits with F ST and quantitative trait locus (QTL) approaches

Abstract The genetic determinism of viral traits can generally be dissected using either forward or reverse genetics because the clonal reproduction of viruses does not require the use of approaches based on laboratory crosses. Nevertheless, we hypothesized that recombinant viruses could be analyzed as sexually reproducing organisms, using either a quantitative trait loci (QTL) approach or a locus-by-locus fixation index (F ST). Locus-by-locus F ST analysis, and four different regressions and interval mapping algorithms of QTL analysis were applied to a phenotypic and genotypic dataset previously obtained from 47 artificial recombinant genomes generated between two begomovirus species. Both approaches assigned the determinant of within-host accumulation—previously identified using standard virology approaches—to a region including the 5׳ end of the replication-associated protein (Rep) gene and the upstream intergenic region. This study provides a proof of principle that QTL and population genetics tools can be extended to characterize the genetic determinants of viral traits.

Endogenous IL‐12 synthesis is not required to prevent hyperexpression of type 2 cytokine and antibody responses

Endogenous IL‐12 production is hypothesized to play an essential role preventing spontaneous expression of type 2 responses, acting as a natural inhibitor limiting development of immediate hypersensitivity. Here, IL‐12‐deficient p35(– / –) and p40(– / –) mice were used to examine the role of endogenous IL‐12 and p40 homodimer during in vivo development of exogenous antigen‐driven responses. In the absence of deliberate immunization, IL‐12‐deficient mice exhibited greatly reduced serum IgG2a but IgG1 / IgE levels no higher than controls. Immunization to elicit polarized ovalbumin‐specific type 1 or type 2 dominant responses, or using Trichinella spiralis extract in the absence of adjuvants, led to IFN‐γ production of approximately 10 % of C57BL / 6 controls yet the kinetics and intensity of primary and secondary type 2 cytokine (IL‐4, IL‐5, IL‐13) and antibody (IgG1, IgE) responses, as well as functional IL‐12 receptor expression, were consistently unaltered. Thus, while IL‐12 provides an important positive signal for Th1 development, antigen exposure in its absence does not lead to generalized enhancement of type 2 cytokine or antibody responses. The data argue that endogenous IL‐12 production is not required as a constitutive negative regulator limiting induction or expression of type 2 effector responses.

Chemical and Structural Aspects of Ebola Virus Entry Inhibitors

[Image: see text] The Ebolaviruses are members of the family Filoviridae (“filoviruses”) and cause severe hemhorragic fever with human case fatality rates as high as 90%. Infection requires attachment of the viral particle to cells and triggering of membrane fusion between the host and viral membranes, a process that occurs in the host endosome and is facilitated by the envelope glycoprotein (GP). One potential strategy for therapeutic intervention is the development of agents (antibodies, peptides, and small molecules) that can interfere with viral entry aspects such as attachment, uptake, priming, or membrane fusion. This paper highlights recent developments in the discovery and evaluation of therapeutic entry inhibitors and identifies opportunities moving forward.

Interstitial lung diseases—can pathologists arrive at an etiology-based diagnosis? A critical update

Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) encompass a group of diseases with a wide range of etiologies and a variety of tissue reactions within the lung. In many instances, a careful evaluation of the tissue reactions will result in a specific diagnosis or at least in a narrow range of differentials, which will assist the clinician to arrive at a definite diagnosis, when combining our interpretation with the clinical presentation of the patient and high-resolution computed tomography. In this review, we will exclude granulomatous pneumonias as well as vascular diseases (primary arterial pulmonary hypertension and vasculitis); however, pulmonary hypertension as a complication of interstitial processes will be mentioned. Few entities of pneumoconiosis presenting as an interstitial process will be included, whereas those with granulomatous reactions will be excluded. Drug reactions will be touched on within interstitial pneumonias, but will not be a major focus. In contrast to the present-day preferred descriptive pattern recognition, it is the author’s strong belief that pathologists should always try to dig out the etiology from a tissue specimen and not being satisfied with just a pattern description. It is the difference of sorting tissue reactions into boxes by their main pattern, without recognizing minor or minute reactions, which sometimes will guide one to the correct etiology-oriented interpretation. In the author’s personal perspective, tissue reactions can even be sorted by their timeliness, and therefore, ordered by the time of appearance, providing an insight into the pathogenesis and course of a disease. Also, underlying immune mechanisms will be discussed briefly as far as they are essential to understand the disease. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00428-012-1305-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Impact of Access Site on Bleeding and Ischemic Events in Patients With Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Treated With Prasugrel: The ACCOAST Access Substudy.

OBJECTIVES This study assessed whether the choice of vascular access site influenced outcomes among non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients enrolled in the ACCOAST (A Comparison of prasugrel at the time of percutaneous Coronary intervention Or as pre-treatment At the time of diagnosis in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction NCT01015287). BACKGROUND Transfemoral access (TFA) has been associated with the risk of bleeding and increased mortality that is elevated compared to transradial access (TRA) in acute coronary syndromes, although less consistently in NSTE acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) than in STE-ACS. METHODS The ACCOAST study evaluated a prasugrel loading dose of 60 mg given at the start of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus a split loading dose of 30 mg given at the time of diagnosis of NSTE-ACS (prior to coronary angiography), followed by 30 mg given at the start of PCI. In the study, choice of access site was at the investigator's discretion. We compared ischemic and bleeding outcomes with TFA versus those with TRA, using propensity score correction. RESULTS Of 4,033 patients, 1,711 (42%) underwent TRA. Use of TRA varied widely by country. TFA was not associated with significant increases in noncoronary bypass graft (CABG)-related thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) (hazard ratio [HR] for TFA = 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.59 to 3.62; p = 0.42), nor in GUSTO (Global Utilization Of Streptokinase and Tpa for Occluded arteries) or STEEPLE (Safety and Efficacy of Enoxaparin in PCI) major bleeding after propensity score correction. TFA, however, increased combined non-CABG TIMI major or minor bleeding (HR for TFA = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.17 to 4.69; p = 0.017). Primary ischemic outcomes did not differ by access site, albeit individual endpoint analysis suggested an association between TFA with an increase in urgent revascularizations and reduced risk of procedure-related stroke. CONCLUSIONS In the ACCOAST trial, TFA did not significantly increase TIMI major bleeding, although TRA was associated with a reduction in TIMI major or minor bleeding. Further study is needed to determine whether wider application of radial approach to NSTE-ACS patients at high risk for bleeding improves overall outcomes.

Incorporating Geographic Information Science and Technology in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Incorporating geographic information science and technology (GIS&T) into COVID-19 pandemic surveillance, modeling, and response enhances understanding and control of the disease. Applications of GIS&T include 1) developing spatial data infrastructures for surveillance and data sharing, 2) incorporating mobility data in infectious disease forecasting, 3) using geospatial technologies for digital contact tracing, 4) integrating geographic data in COVID-19 modeling, 5) investigating geographic social vulnerabilities and health disparities, and 6) communicating the status of the disease or status of facilities for return-to-normal operations. Locations and availability of personal protective equipment, ventilators, hospital beds, and other items can be optimized with the use of GIS&T. Challenges include protection of individual privacy and civil liberties and closer collaboration among the fields of geography, medicine, public health, and public policy.

Targeting autophagy to enhance oncolytic virus-based cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process crucial in maintaining cellular homeostasis. On infection, oncolytic viruses (OVs) perturb the cellular autophagy machinery in infected tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. Currently, pharmacological modulation of autophagy in OV-infected tumor cells has been shown to augment OV-mediated antitumor effects in preclinical studies. Combination of OVs with autophagy modulators can, therefore, have many potential applications in the future research on targeting autophagy and novel anticancer therapies. AREAS COVERED This review provides a detailed description of known interactions between OVs and autophagy and summarizes the roles of autophagy in OV replication and cell lysis. The recent literature on targeting autophagy with either the autophagy inducers, such as rapamycin, or autophagy inhibitors, such as chloroquine, to increase OV-induced cytotoxicity is reviewed to help researchers in further investigations. The major challenge for investigators is to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the interplay between OV and the autophagy machinery and its effect on oncolysis. EXPERT OPINION Targeting the cellular autophagy machinery could be explored as a new therapeutic strategy to enhance OV-mediated antitumor effects in the future.

No way out? Intention zur Einhaltung von Corona-Ausgangsbeschränkungen im Kontext einer „extended theory of reasoned action“

BACKGROUND: In March 2020, it was necessary to impose so-called curfews for several weeks across Germany due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This meant massive restraints for the population. OBJECTIVES: It was to be investigated whether the theory of reasoned action (TORA) is an adequate method for explaining the intention to follow the curfews and to explain whether anticipation of sanctions influences the intention. There are two key questions: (1) is the TORA suitable for explaining the intention to comply with the imposed curfews? and (2) does an extension of TORA by the variable sanction-anticipation influence the intention to obey the imposed curfews? METHODS: Using an online survey, it was investigated the individual’s intention, attitudes and subjective norm to follow the restrictions, and also the anticipation of sanctions for noncompliance using a rating scale (1–7). Multiple linear regression and hierarchical regression analysis were used to clarify key questions. RESULTS: In all, 1269 evaluable records demonstrated that the intention to follow the curfews is high (mean 6.24, standard deviation 1.2) and that this can be elucidated through the attitudes and subjective norm to 67% (p < 0.001). There is no impact of impending sanctions for noncompliance (∆R(2) = 0.002). DISCUSSION: The TORA is suitable for explaining the intention to comply with the curfews. Key political decision-makers should avoid threatening sanctions during speeches to increase compliance but instead emphasize the meaning and benefit of the measures for society and also for the individual’s own social environment in order to positively influence the intended goals.

Influenza A virus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase act as novel motile machinery

Influenza A virus (IAV) membrane proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are determinants of virus infectivity, transmissibility, pathogenicity, host specificity, and major antigenicity. HA binds to a virus receptor, a sialoglycoprotein or sialoglycolipid, on the host cell and mediates virus attachment to the cell surface. The hydrolytic enzyme NA cleaves sialic acid from viral receptors and accelerates the release of progeny virus from host cells. In this study, we identified a novel function of HA and NA as machinery for viral motility. HAs exchanged binding partner receptors iteratively, generating virus movement on a receptor-coated glass surface instead of a cell surface. The virus movement was also dependent on NA. Virus movement mediated by HA and NA resulted in a three to four-fold increase in virus internalisation by cultured cells. We concluded that cooperation of HA and NA moves IAV particles on a cell surface and enhances virus infection of host cells.

ENDOCRINOLOGY IN THE TIME OF COVID-19: Management of Cushing's syndrome

Clinical evaluation should guide those needing immediate investigation. Strict adherence to COVID-19 protection measures is necessary. Alternative ways of consultations (telephone, video) should be used. Early discussion with regional/national experts about investigation and management of potential and existing patients is strongly encouraged. Patients with moderate or severe clinical features need urgent investigation and management. Patients with active Cushing's syndrome, especially when severe, are immunocompromised and vigorous adherence to the principles of social isolation is recommended. In patients with mild features or in whom a diagnosis is less likely, clinical re-evaluation should be repeated at 3 and 6 months or deferred until the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has significantly decreased; however, those individuals should be encouraged to maintain social distancing. Diagnostic pathways may need to be very different from usual recommendations in order to reduce possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2. When extensive differential diagnostic testing and/or surgery is not feasible, it should be deferred and medical treatment should be initiated. Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery should be delayed during high SARS-CoV-2 viral prevalence. Medical management rather than surgery will be the used for most patients, since the short- to mid-term prognosis depends in most cases on hypercortisolism rather than its cause; it should be initiated promptly to minimize the risk of infection in these immunosuppressed patients. The risk/benefit ratio of these recommendations will need re-evaluation every 2-3 months from April 2020 in each country (and possibly local areas) and will depend on the local health care structure and phase of pandemic.

Elective Tracheostomy During Mechanical Ventilation in Patients Affected by COVID-19: Preliminary Case Series From Lombardy, Italy.

The COVID-19 outbreak poses continued struggles due to the unprecedented number of patients admitted to intensive care units and the overwhelming need for mechanical ventilation. We report a preliminary case series of 32 patients with COVID-19 who underwent elective tracheostomies after a mean intubation period of 15 days (range, 9-21 days). The procedure was performed with percutaneous (10 cases) and open (22 cases) surgical techniques. Neither procedure-related complications nor viral transmission to health care workers was observed. Our preliminary experience supports the safety of tracheostomy, provided that appropriate protocols are strictly followed. The postoperative care is still debated, and, prudentially, our protocol includes tracheal tube change not before 2 weeks after tracheostomy, with cuff deflation and decannulation deferred until confirmation of negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. This is the first case series to report on such a rapidly evolving issue and might represent a source of information for clinicians worldwide who will soon be facing the same challenges.

Neutralizing Complement C5a Protects Mice with Pneumococcal Pulmonary Sepsis.

BACKGROUND Community-acquired pneumonia and associated sepsis cause high mortality despite antibiotic treatment. Uncontrolled inflammatory host responses contribute to the unfavorable outcome by driving lung and extrapulmonary organ failure. The complement fragment C5a holds significant proinflammatory functions and is associated with tissue damage in various inflammatory conditions. The authors hypothesized that C5a concentrations are increased in pneumonia and C5a neutralization promotes barrier stabilization in the lung and is protective in pneumococcal pulmonary sepsis. METHODS The authors investigated regulation of C5a in pneumonia in a prospective patient cohort and in experimental pneumonia. Two complementary models of murine pneumococcal pneumonia were applied. Female mice were treated with NOX-D19, a C5a-neutralizing L-RNA-aptamer. Lung, liver, and kidney injury and the inflammatory response were assessed by measuring pulmonary permeability (primary outcome), pulmonary and blood leukocytes, cytokine concentrations in lung and blood, and bacterial load in lung, spleen, and blood, and performing histologic analyses of tissue damage, apoptosis, and fibrin deposition (n = 5 to 13). RESULTS In hospitalized patients with pneumonia (n = 395), higher serum C5a concentrations were observed compared to healthy subjects (n = 24; 6.3 nmol/l [3.9 to 10.0] vs. 4.5 nmol/l [3.8 to 6.6], median [25 to 75% interquartile range]; difference: 1.4 [95% CI, 0.1 to 2.9]; P = 0.029). Neutralization of C5a in mice resulted in lower pulmonary permeability in pneumococcal pneumonia (1.38 ± 0.89 vs. 3.29 ± 2.34, mean ± SD; difference: 1.90 [95% CI, 0.15 to 3.66]; P = 0.035; n = 10 or 11) or combined severe pneumonia and mechanical ventilation (2.56 ± 1.17 vs. 7.31 ± 5.22; difference: 4.76 [95% CI, 1.22 to 8.30]; P = 0.011; n = 9 or 10). Further, C5a neutralization led to lower blood granulocyte colony-stimulating factor concentrations and protected against sepsis-associated liver injury. CONCLUSIONS Systemic C5a is elevated in pneumonia patients. Neutralizing C5a protected against lung and liver injury in pneumococcal pneumonia in mice. Early neutralization of C5a might be a promising adjunctive treatment strategy to improve outcome in community-acquired pneumonia. : WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: Pneumonia, sepsis, and immune dysregulation cause morbidity and mortalityC5a is a component of the complement system and a proinflammatory mediator that modulates the innate immune response in critical illnessDisruption of the C5a receptor axis with antibodies or antagonists was previously protective in various animal sepsis models WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: In hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia, serum C5a concentrations were 1.4-fold higher compared to healthy subjectsIn two mouse models of pneumonia and sepsis, NOX-D19, a C5a-neutralizing L-RNA aptamer, caused lower pulmonary hyperpermeability and sepsis-related acute liver injury.

Detection of Viral RNA Splicing in Diagnostic Virology

Diagnostic virology is to identify the etiologic cause of infection from patient’s samples. In the past the diagnostic virology relied on three classical techniques to make a diagnosis of viral infection: (a) virus isolation by direct virus cultivation, (b) viral antigen detection, (c) indirect detection of virus-specific antibodies. While being important tools in the diagnostic virology today, these techniques are time-consuming and require specific tools such as cultivation media, cell or tissue cultures, antibodies, purified antigens. In the past decade the number of new molecular-based methods grew rapidly and gained more popularity in diagnostic labs. The core of these techniques constitutes of techniques based on nucleic acid detection by specific amplification, hybridization, and/or sequencing (reviewed in ref. [1]). The most nucleic acid-based diagnostic methods are simple, speed, sensitive and specific and thus meet the gold four-S-standard for their application in any diagnostic laboratories. The methods are simple and speed because only a specific primer pair and a PCR machine are needed in a lab setting and identification of a viral pathogen takes within few hours. They are sensitive and specific and require only a small amount of patients’ materials to detect a specific nucleotide sequence region. In general, these techniques can be used to detect almost all types of viral pathogens and even to identify multiple viral pathogens or their variants at the same time. In this chapter we focus on detection of viral RNA splicing as a new tool for diagnostic virology.

Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae: Ecology, Infection Dynamics and Disease Epidemiology

Since 2008, the kiwifruit industry has been devastated by a pandemic outbreak of Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), the causal agent of bacterial canker. This disease has become the most significant limiting factor in kiwifruit production. Psa colonizes different organs of the host plant, causing a specific symptomatology on each of them. In addition, the systemic invasion of the plant may quickly lead to plant death. Despite the massive risk that this disease poses to the kiwifruit industry, studies focusing on Psa ecology have been sporadic, and a comprehensive description of the disease epidemiology is still missing. Optimal environmental conditions for infection, dispersal and survival in the environment, or the mechanisms of penetration and colonization of host tissues have not been fully elucidated yet. The present work aims to provide a synthesis of the current knowledge, and a deeper understanding of the epidemiology of kiwifruit bacterial canker based on new experimental data. The pathogen may survive in the environment or overwinter in dormant tissues and be dispersed by wind or rain. Psa was observed in association with several plant structures (stomata, trichomes, lenticels) and wounds, which could represent entry points for apoplast infection. Environmental conditions also affect the bacterial colonization, with lower optimum values of temperature and humidity for epiphytic than for endophytic growth, and disease incidence requiring a combination of mild temperature and leaf wetness. By providing information on Psa ecology, these data sets may contribute to plan efficient control strategies for kiwifruit bacterial canker. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1007/s00248-019-01459-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

SARS-CoV-2 detection using digital PCR for COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment monitoring and criteria for discharge

Background: SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection by RT-PCR is one of the criteria approved by China FDA for diagnosis of COVID-19. However, inaccurate test results (for example, high false negative rate and some false positive rate) were reported in both China and US CDC using the RT-PCR method. Inaccurate results are caused by inadequate detection sensitivity of RT-PCR, low viral load in some patients, difficulty to collect samples from COVID-19 patients, insufficient sample loading during RT-PCR tests, and RNA degradation during sample handling process. False negative detection could subject patients to multiple tests before diagnosis can be made, which burdens health care system. Delayed diagnosis could cause infected patients to miss the best treatment time window. False negative detection could also lead to prematurely releasing infected patients who still carry residual SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this case, these patients could infect many others. A high sensitivity RNA detection method to resolve the existing issues of RT-PCR is in need for more accurate COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods: Digital PCR (dPCR) instrument DropX-2000 and assay kits were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 from 108 clinical specimens from 36 patients including pharyngeal swab, stool and blood from different days during hospitalization. Double-blinded experiment data of 108 clinical specimens by dPCR methods were compared with results from officially approved RT-PCR assay. A total of 109 samples including 108 clinical specimens and 1 negative control sample were tested in this study. All of 109 samples, 26 were from 21patients reported as positive by officially approved clinical RT-PCR detection in local CDC and then hospitalized in Nantong Third Hospital. Among the 109 samples, dPCR detected 30 positive samples on ORFA1ab gene, 47 samples with N gene positive, and 30 samples with double positive on ORFA1ab and N genes. Results: The lower limit of detection of the optimize dPCR is at least 10-fold lower than that of RT-PCR. The overall accuracy of dPCR for clinical detection is 96.3%. 4 out 4 of (100 %) negative pharyngeal swab samples checked by RT-PCR were positive judged by dPCR based on the follow-up investigation. 2 of 2 samples in the RT-PCR grey area (Ct value > 37) were confirmed by dPCR with positive results. 1 patient being tested positive by RT-PCR was confirmed to be negative by dPCR. The dPCR results show clear viral loading decrease in 12 patients as treatment proceed, which can be a useful tool for monitoring COVID-19 treatment. Conclusions: Digital PCR shows improved lower limit of detection, sensitivity and accuracy, enabling COVID-19 detection with less false negative and false positive results comparing with RT-PCR, especially for the tests with low viral load specimens. We showed evidences that dPCR is powerful in detecting asymptomatic patients and suspected patients. Digital PCR is capable of checking the negative results caused by insufficient sample loading by quantifying internal reference gene from human RNA in the PCR reactions. Multi-channel fluorescence dPCR system (FAM/HEX/CY5/ROX) is able to detect more target genes in a single multiplex assay, providing quantitative count of viral load in specimens, which is a powerful tool for monitoring COVID-19 treatment.

Peripheral Intravenous Access in Preterm Neonates during Postnatal Stabilization: Feasibility and Safety.

BACKGROUND Current European Guideline for resuscitation recommends a centrally positioned umbilical venous catheter as the best option for administering necessary drugs. Especially in preterm infants, a frequently used alternative is the peripheral venous catheter. METHODS Two randomized controlled studies were conducted at the Division of Neonatology, Medical University of Graz. During neonatal resuscitation, a standardized protocol was filled out by an uninvolved observer including time points after birth of all attempts of venous puncture, time point of successful venous puncture, and total number of needed attempts. Arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) were measured using pulse oximetry at the right hand/wrist. In each neonate, either NIRO 200NX (Hamamatsu, Japan) or INVOS 5100C (Covidien-Medtronic, USA) were used to measure cerebral tissue oxygenation index (cTOI) and cerebral regional oxygen saturation (crSO2), respectively. SpO2, HR, and cTOI/crSO2 during and 1 min before and after successful venous punctures were analyzed. RESULTS 70 protocols were reviewed. Data of 61 preterm neonates were analyzed. Mean gestational age was 31.5 ± 2.2 weeks, and the mean birth weight was 1,527 ± 541 g. In median, it needed one attempt [interquartile range (IQR) 1-2] to establish a peripheral venous catheter. In median, intravenous (IV) catheterization was successfully established 5 (IQR 4-9) min after birth. SpO2 and cTOI/crSO2 rose significantly following the percentiles during the first 10 min after the birth. HR did not change significantly. CONCLUSION Peripheral IV catheterization during postnatal stabilization of preterm infants is feasible and successful in most of the cases at first attempt.

Fractal analysis of retinal vessels suggests that a distinct vasculopathy causes lacunar stroke.

OBJECTIVES Lacunar strokes account for 25% of all ischemic strokes and may represent the cerebral manifestation of a systemic small vessel vasculopathy of unknown etiology. Altered retinal vessel fractal dimensions may act as a surrogate marker for diseased cerebral vessels. We used a cross-sectional study to investigate fractal properties of retinal vessels in lacunar stroke. METHODS We recruited patients presenting with lacunar stroke and patients with minor cortical stroke as controls. All patients were examined by a stroke expert and had MRI at presentation. Digital retinal photographs were taken of both eyes. Monofractal and multifractal analyses were performed with custom-written semiautomated software. RESULTS We recruited 183 patients. Seventeen were excluded owing to poor photographic quality, leaving 166 patients (86 with lacunar and 80 with cortical stroke). The mean age was 67.3 years (SD 11.5 years). The patients with lacunar stroke were younger but the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and white matter hyperintensities did not differ between the groups. The mean Dbox (monofractal dimension) was 1.42 (SD 0.02), the mean D0 (multifractal dimension) 1.67 (SD 0.03). With multivariate analysis, decreased Dbox and D0 (both representing decreased branching complexity) were associated with increasing age and lacunar stroke subtype after correcting for hypertension, diabetes, stroke severity, and white matter hyperintensity scores. CONCLUSIONS Lacunar stroke subtype and increasing age are associated with decreased fractal dimensions, suggesting a loss of branching complexity. Further studies should concentrate on longitudinal associations with other manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease.

Développement professionnel continu (DPC) et émergence de la recertification en France. Évolution législative et commentaires()

Continuing medical education (CME) is an obligation in France. The evaluation of professional practices joined in 2004 the obligation to acquire knowledge, becoming the Continuing professional development (CPD) in 2009. Currently, the system is complete: definition, organization and validation. However, the individual obligation to validate the CPD has never been applied. The recertification process provided for by the 2019 law will not be operational until 2021, at the earliest. Its essential pillar is CPD. The recertification mission who prepared the law excludes all knowledge verification tests. Recertification is done by promoting the professional career path including, in addition to CPD, a maintained and regular activity, an improvement in the relationship with the patient, taking into account the doctor's health and the absence of undesirable events. Seeing that the French Medical Council oversees the professional skills of physicians, it is the Council that receives the validation of the CPD and will receive that of recertification.

Linking the Historical Roots of Environmental Conservation with Human and Wildlife Health

We examine the historical and philosophical roots of environmental stewardship and how they relate to conservation and human health. Concern for the environment in the United States derives from two distinct historical ideologies that we term “green” and “brown” environmentalism. We propose a modern-day synthesis of these ideologies that recognizes that environmental degradation and the emergence of zoonotic and epizootic diseases, affecting both humans and wildlife (i.e., pathogen pollution), are interconnected. This interconnection provides a compelling new reason to protect and preserve biodiversity.

Prospective evaluation of an internet-linked handheld computer critical care knowledge access system

INTRODUCTION: Critical care physicians may benefit from immediate access to medical reference material. We evaluated the feasibility and potential benefits of a handheld computer based knowledge access system linking a central academic intensive care unit (ICU) to multiple community-based ICUs. METHODS: Four community hospital ICUs with 17 physicians participated in this prospective interventional study. Following training in the use of an internet-linked, updateable handheld computer knowledge access system, the physicians used the handheld devices in their clinical environment for a 12-month intervention period. Feasibility of the system was evaluated by tracking use of the handheld computer and by conducting surveys and focus group discussions. Before and after the intervention period, participants underwent simulated patient care scenarios designed to evaluate the information sources they accessed, as well as the speed and quality of their decision making. Participants generated admission orders during each scenario, which were scored by blinded evaluators. RESULTS: Ten physicians (59%) used the system regularly, predominantly for nonmedical applications (median 32.8/month, interquartile range [IQR] 28.3–126.8), with medical software accessed less often (median 9/month, IQR 3.7–13.7). Eight out of 13 physicians (62%) who completed the final scenarios chose to use the handheld computer for information access. The median time to access information on the handheld handheld computer was 19 s (IQR 15–40 s). This group exhibited a significant improvement in admission order score as compared with those who used other resources (P = 0.018). Benefits and barriers to use of this technology were identified. CONCLUSION: An updateable handheld computer system is feasible as a means of point-of-care access to medical reference material and may improve clinical decision making. However, during the study, acceptance of the system was variable. Improved training and new technology may overcome some of the barriers we identified.

Evidence for probable aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a poorly ventilated restaurant

Background: The role of aerosols in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains debated. We analysed an outbreak involving three non-associated families in Restaurant X in Guangzhou, China, and assessed the possibility of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and characterize the associated environmental conditions. Methods: We collected epidemiological data, obtained a video record and a patron seating-arrangement from the restaurant, and measured the dispersion of a warm tracer gas as a surrogate for exhaled droplets from the suspected index patient. Computer simulations were performed to simulate the spread of fine exhaled droplets. We compared the in-room location of subsequently infected cases and spread of the simulated virus-laden aerosol tracer. The ventilation rate was measured using the tracer decay method. Results: Three families (A, B, C), 10 members of which were subsequently found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 at this time, or previously, ate lunch at Restaurant X on Chinese New Year's Eve (January 24, 2020) at three neighboring tables. Subsequently, three members of family B and two members of family C became infected with SARS-CoV-2, whereas none of the waiters or 68 patrons at the remaining 15 tables became infected. During this occasion, the ventilation rate was 0.75-1.04 L/s per person. No close contact or fomite contact was observed, aside from back-to-back sitting by some patrons. Our results show that the infection distribution is consistent with a spread pattern representative of exhaled virus-laden aerosols. Conclusions: Aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 due to poor ventilation may explain the community spread of COVID-19.

Confronting SARS: a view from Hong Kong.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged as a new disease in Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China in late 2002. Within weeks it had spread to Hong Kong and thence globally to affect over 25 countries across five continents. The disease had the propensity to cause clusters of pneumonia, particularly in healthcare workers or close family contacts. A global effort coordinated by the World Health Organization successfully defined the aetiology, epidemiology and clinical characteristics of the disease, and the implementation of case identification, isolation and infection control measures led to the interruption of the global outbreak by July 2003. The pattern of disease emergence and strategies for control of SARS provides lessons for coping with future emerging infectious disease threats.

Pharmacological and non-pharmacological efforts at prevention, mitigation, and treatment for COVID-19

A global outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected millions of people over a short period of time. The communicability and increased mortality from the SARS-CoV-2 infection mandated the WHO to declare COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic. The virus outbreak has spread when there are no approved vaccines, treatments, or prophylactic therapies available. Researchers from all over the world have prioritized development of vaccines and antivirals. Several vaccine projects have seen successes in preclinical, phase I, and phase II clinical trials using recombinant DNA, mRNA, live attenuated virus, S-protein subunits, virus like particles, and viral vectors. Initial findings from antivirals such as remdesivir, favipiravir, danoprevir or lopinavir with ritonavir are presented. Immunomodulatory molecules such as sarilumab, tocilizumab, janus kinase inhibitors, and hyperimmune convalescent plasma have mixed outcomes from initial clinical findings; however, pending randomized controlled trials will assist national health institutions to make treatment recommendations for COVID-19. Where compassionate use of remdesivir has shown some benefits, therapies such as hydroxychloroquine have proven harmful due to their toxicities. This review discusses pharmacological interventions at play and evidence-based successes and limitations of non-pharmacological therapies such as social distancing, personal protective equipment, and ventilator support associated with the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

Intracorporeal overlap gastro-gastrostomy for solo single-incision pylorus-preserving gastrectomy in early gastric cancer.

This report discusses the technique of solo single-incision pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (SIPPG) for early gastric cancer. To overcome difficulties regarding lymph node dissection (LND), a scope holder and an energy device were used, allowing fine dissection in a fixed field of view. The overlap gastro-gastrostomy technique was used for anastomosis. Seventeen patients underwent solo SIPGG. The mean operation time was 150.1 ± 28.7 min, and no patients developed postoperative complications or delayed gastric emptying within 30 days of the operation. Using scope holders and performing fine dissection with the energy device, challenges regarding LND in SIPPG can be overcome. INTACT anastomosis was initially used; however, due to its inconsistency and the high degree of surgical skill required, it was changed to the overlap method.

Physician and Nurse Practitioner Roles in Emergency, Trauma, Critical and Intensive Care

Abstract Importance The delivery of emergency, trauma, critical and intensive care services requires coordination among all members of the care team. Perceived teamwork and role clarity may vary among physicians (MDs) and nurse practitioners (NPs). Objective To examine differences in perceived roles and responsibilities of NPs and MDs practicing in emergency, trauma, critical and intensive care. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s) Key clinical activities, perceptions of role clarity, teamwork and preparedness to function as a team in disaster Design Secondary Analysis of the National Survey of Emergency, Intensive and Critical Care Nurse Practitioners and Physicians, a 2015 cross-sectional national survey of clinicians. Setting Mail survey of randomly selected stratified cross-sectional samples of MDs and NPs drawn from national lists of clinicians in eligible specialties working in emergency, trauma, intensive and critical care units in the United States. Participants 814 clinicians (351 NPs and 463 MDs) recruited from national by postal mail survey. Our initial sample included n=2063 clinicians, n=1031 NPs and n=1032 MDs in eligible specialties. Of these, 63.5% of NPs and 70.1% of MDs completed and returned the survey excluding those who were ineligible due to lack of current practice in a relevant specialty Results NPs in ICU/CCU are more likely to be female and report working fewer hours than do MDs and provide direct care to more patients. 55% of NPs and 82% of MDs agree that their individual role in their unit is clear (p<.001); 34% of MDs and 42% of NPs agree that their unit is an example of excellent team work among professionals (p=0.021); 41% of MD and 37% of NP clinicians (p=0.061) agree that their teams are “prepared to provide outstanding care in a crisis or disaster”. Perceived role clarity was significantly associated with increased perceptions of excellent teamwork and disaster preparedness. Conclusion and Relevance Leaders of health organizations need to engage with one another and with their professional teams to assure that roles and responsibilities are clear and that teams are both prepared to provide the highest quality and efficient care in critical care and in disaster.

Rete mirabile associated with pial arteriovenous fistula: imaging features with literature review.

A rete mirabile is a vascular network of intercommunicating small arteries or arterioles that replace the definitive adult artery supplying the brain. It supplies the brain in lower mammals but is not seen in normal human embryological development. A 26-year-old man presented with worsening tinnitus that was interfering with his sleep. On CT and digital subtraction angiography he was found to have a temporal lobe pial arteriovenous fistula with bilateral carotid and vertebral rete mirabile. The patient was offered open surgical and endovascular treatment options for pial arteriovenous fistula but he refused both and opted for conservative medical management. At 6-month follow-up he continued to have pulsatile tinnitus but was otherwise neurologically normal. We present the first described association of rete mirabile with pial arteriovenous fistula and discuss its clinical presentation and imaging features, with a review of the literature for bilateral carotid and vertebral rete mirabile.

Recurring and emerging questions related to management of HIV-related opportunistic infections.

The incidence of HIV-related opportunistic infections (OIs) has dramatically declined with the ability to achieve viral suppression and immune reconstitution with potent antiretroviral therapy. However, a large number of patients remain at risk for OIs because they are diagnosed at late stages of HIV disease, fail to stay in treatment, or fail to maintain viral suppression. Clinicians should remain vigilant for OIs and for changes in recommended management strategies. Issues that often arise in this regard include how to interpret polymerase chain reaction diagnostic results in individuals with HIV infection; whether primary prophylaxis for Mycobacterium avium complex is still needed; whether clinicians should screen asymptomatic patients for cryptococcal antigen; and need for amphotericin B in treatment regimens for cryptococcal meningitis. This article summarizes a presentation by Henry Masur, MD, at the IAS-USA continuing education program held in Washington, DC, in April 2018.

Novel Coronavirus Disease: A delicate balancing act between health and the economy

The emergence of the deadly novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has resuscitated global attention on the state of health governance and well-being of citizens. Worldwide, countries are in dire dilemma of safeguarding the health of their citizens and equally salvaging economy, arising from the social distancing and lockdown strategies, which affects negatively the economic activities. This paper examines the intricate balance between health and the economy in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the policy options needed to assist countries to implement strategies to protect the health of their citizens and promote economic recovery in this unprecedented global crisis situation. There is need for a coordinated public-private sector partnership in the recovery plan of each country, taking into account their contextual and country specific health system and economy, but not discarding the universal application thereof. Global, regional, national geo-political and public health collaboration is needed to save the world from COVID-19 catastrophic consequences.

A rapid, quantitative assay for titration of bovine virus diarrhoea-mucosal disease virus()

An end point dilution microtitration assay is described that can be used for the titration of both cytopathic and non-cytopathic isolates of bovine virus diarrhoea-mucosal disease virus. Indirect immunofluorescence is used to detect infected MDBK cells in the wells of Terasaki plates. The virus titre is derived from the number of uninfected wells, using the Poisson distribution. The assay is simple, fast and economical. Titres of cytopathic virus determined by the microtitration assay and standard plaque assay are equivalent.

Efficacy and safety of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel from a study in Japanese, Taiwanese, and Korean advanced Parkinson's disease patients.

In a previous multinational, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study, levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) was tolerable and significantly improved 'off' time in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. However, efficacy and safety in the Asian population has not yet been demonstrated. In this open-label study, efficacy and safety of LCIG were assessed in Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese advanced PD patients with motor complications not adequately controlled by available PD medication. The patients were treated with LCIG monotherapy for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the mean change from baseline to week 12 in 'off' time, as reported in the PD Symptom Diary, normalized to a 16 h waking day and analyzed by a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Thirty-one patients were enrolled (23 Japanese, 4 Taiwanese, 4 Korean) and 28 (90%) completed the study. For those who completed the study, the mean (s.d.) total daily levodopa dose from LCIG was 1,206.3 (493.6) mg/day at final visit (n=28); last observation carried forward (n=30) was 1,227.6 (482.8) mg/day. There was a significant mean change (s.d.) of -4.6 (3.0) hours of 'off' time from baseline (mean (s.d.)=7.4 (2.3)) to week 12 (n=29), P<0.001. All the patients had an AE, with the most frequently reported being incision site pain (42%); 1 (3.2%) discontinued treatment because of an AE and later died because of sepsis, which the investigator considered unrelated to LCIG treatment. These results suggest that LCIG is efficacious and tolerable in Japanese, Taiwanese, and Korean advanced PD patients.

Global Spread (October 2014)

As the Ebola outbreak continued to rage in West Africa, Western countries began to be directly affected by the disease. On the last day of September 2014, the first active Ebola case was diagnosed in the United States. Officials in Dallas, Texas, scrambled to contain the virus. A few weeks later, tension rose dramatically when two of the nurses who treated the initial US patient developed Ebola. One of the nurses traveled to Ohio and back before becoming sick. She flew by plane and had contact with other travelers. Officials were very worried that Ebola flare-ups would start to occur across the country. On October 6, 2014, a nursing assistant in Spain was diagnosed with Ebola. Like the US nurses, she had helped treat a repatriated Ebola victim. On October 23, 2014, a new US case was identified. A doctor was diagnosed with Ebola in New York City after returning from Guinea. On the same day, an Ebola case was discovered in the West African country of Mali. The Ebola outbreak seemed out of control and poised to start a major international epidemic. In West Africa, however, a corner had been turned. Healthcare efforts had shifted from treating all Ebola patients in medical facilities to providing families with supplies to take care of sick patients at home. Toward the end of October 2014, reports started to surface about there being fewer cases in West Africa, especially in Liberia. These reports were initially treated with caution. As time progressed, however, it became clear that the drop in cases was real.

Cellular RNA Helicases Support Early and Late Events in Retroviral Replication

Retroviruses commandeer cell RNA helicases (RHs). Cell RHs are necessary for early and late events in retrovirus replication. The provirus is adopted by the cell-endogenous nuclear and cytoplasmic gene expression types of machinery. Whereas retroviruses engender the supportive activity of cell RHs, other RNA viruses provoke theantiviral role of this superfamily of conserved proteins. In this chapter, we contrast retrovirus reliance on host RNA helicases to support their replication cycle, with the virus-encoded helicaseactivity utilized by RNA viruses in cytoplasmic factories. Ironically, RHs are agonists to retroviruses and antagonists to other RNA viruses.

Crystal structure of aminopeptidase N (proteobacteria alanyl aminopeptidase) from Escherichia coli and conformational change of methionine 260 involved in substrate recognition.

Aminopeptidase N from Escherichia coli is a broad specificity zinc exopeptidase belonging to aminopeptidase clan MA, family M1. The structures of the ligand-free form and the enzyme-bestatin complex were determined at 1.5- and 1.6-A resolution, respectively. The enzyme is composed of four domains: an N-terminal beta-domain (Met(1)-Asp(193)), a catalytic domain (Phe(194)-Gly(444)), a middle beta-domain (Thr(445)-Trp(546)), and a C-terminal alpha-domain (Ser(547)-Ala(870)). The structure of the catalytic domain exhibits similarity to thermolysin, and a metal-binding motif (HEXXHX(18)E) is found in the domain. The zinc ion is coordinated by His(297), His(301), Glu(320), and a water molecule. The groove on the catalytic domain that contains the active site is covered by the C-terminal alpha-domain, and a large cavity is formed inside the protein. However, there exists a small hole at the center of the C-terminal alpha-domain. The N terminus of bestatin is recognized by Glu(121) and Glu(264), which are located in the N-terminal and catalytic domains, respectively. Glu(298) and Tyr(381), located near the zinc ion, are considered to be involved in peptide cleavage. A difference revealed between the ligand-free form and the enzyme-bestatin complex indicated that Met(260) functions as a cushion to accept substrates with different N-terminal residue sizes, resulting in the broad substrate specificity of this enzyme.

COVID‐19 Pandemic and Its Impact on the Global Economy: What Does It Take to Turn Crisis into Opportunity?

The COVID‐19 pandemic broke out at a time when there were heightened uncertainties in the global economy. Understanding these uncertainties provides an important background for analyzing the impact of the pandemic on the global economy, assessing the effectiveness of those policy measures in combating the pandemic and reviving the global economy, and predicting the trajectory of the economic recovery in post‐pandemic era. We analyze how COVID‐19 would likely deepen some existing malaise in the global economy, and what could be done to redress these problems while managing economic recovery from the crisis and beyond. We argue that three fundamental factors which could lead to a solid recovery in the post pandemic era are structural reform, new technology and re‐integration which could be managed through instituting a new “global social contract.” Supported by strong public policies at all levels especially at national levels, the tripartite could serve as salvation of the global economy recovering or re‐emerging from this pandemic crisis.

Immunomic Discovery of Adjuvants, Delivery Systems, and Candidate Subunit Vaccines: A Brief Introduction

Mass vaccination, when coupled to profound improvements in general sanitation, has given rise to the most remarkable transformation in public health in human history. Yet the development of vaccines remains largely trapped in the past, a hostage to the methodology of Pasteur. Infectious disease continues to threaten humanity, with new and renascent diseases emerging continually. The last two decades have seen a breath-taking revival in the commercial market for vaccines and the simultaneous emergence of a whole tranche of new technologies that promise to free vaccine development from the muddle of empirical thinking. In this short introduction, we set the scene for this renaissance, and explore how the combination of computational and experimental techniques promise so much for the future development of vaccines and the science of vaccinology.

Extracorporeal life support for pandemic influenza: the role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in pandemic management.

The recent global threat of a severe pandemic influenza outbreak has suggested that extracorporeal life support will begin to play an evolving role in the care of critically ill influenza stricken patients. The highly communicable attributes of influenza could result in widespread infection and an associated increased need for advanced life support. Supply and demand equilibrium may be abruptly disrupted, and ethical decisions regarding the allocation of life saving resources will inevitably need to be made. Protocol oriented planning, research analysis, and advanced technologies are critical factors in averting catastrophe. This review article details the epidemiology, diagnostic techniques, and interventions for the influenza A virus, including H1N1.

Isolated pharmacomechanical thrombolysis plus primary stenting in a single procedure to treat acute thrombotic superior vena cava syndrome.

PURPOSE To report a combined procedure that opens the acutely thrombosed superior vena cava (SVC) to rapidly alleviate symptoms in seriously ill patients with SVC syndrome. CASE REPORTS Four patients aged 54 to 63 years old with underlying malignancies were referred for treatment of SVC syndrome. All received isolated pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (IPMT) with tissue plasminogen activator delivered in a Trellis Peripheral Infusion System that removed obstructive clot in minutes versus the 24 to 48 hours required for traditional catheter-directed thrombolysis. In each case, stents were inserted immediately following IPMT in a combined procedure lasting <1 hour. Patients exhibited near-immediate relief of debilitating symptoms; completion venography demonstrated patent vessels with excellent blood flow. CONCLUSION Combining IPMT with immediate stenting during the same session is an effective method for managing acute thrombotic SVC syndrome and limiting the exposure time and number of interventions performed on seriously ill patients.

G-Quadruplex-Based Fluorescent Turn-On Ligands and Aptamers: From Development to Applications

Guanine (G)-quadruplexes (G4s) are unique nucleic acid structures that are formed by stacked G-tetrads in G-rich DNA or RNA sequences. G4s have been reported to play significant roles in various cellular events in both macro- and micro-organisms. The identification and characterization of G4s can help to understand their different biological roles and potential applications in diagnosis and therapy. In addition to biophysical and biochemical methods to interrogate G4 formation, G4 fluorescent turn-on ligands can be used to target and visualize G4 formation both in vitro and in cells. Here, we review several representative classes of G4 fluorescent turn-on ligands in terms of their interaction mechanism and application perspectives. Interestingly, G4 structures are commonly identified in DNA and RNA aptamers against targets that include proteins and small molecules, which can be utilized as G4 tools for diverse applications. We therefore also summarize the recent development of G4-containing aptamers and highlight their applications in biosensing, bioimaging, and therapy. Moreover, we discuss the current challenges and future perspectives of G4 fluorescent turn-on ligands and G4-containing aptamers.

Proactive COVID-19 Infection Prevention Measures in a Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Center.

Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and its subsequent global spread, Taiwan has been combatting this pandemic. COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through droplets and aerosols, we cannot ignore the risk of transmission during hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). Our hyperbaric oxygen therapy center prioritizes preventing the spread of COVID-19 and maintaining operation for the patients during the pandemic. The aim of this article is to share the protocol that we have adopted in our hyperbaric oxygen therapy center to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Scope, quality, and inclusivity of clinical guidelines produced early in the covid-19 pandemic: rapid review

OBJECTIVE: To appraise the availability, quality, and inclusivity of clinical guidelines produced in the early stage of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic. DESIGN: Rapid review. DATA SOURCES: Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Ovid Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and WHO Global Index Medicus, searched from inception to 14 Mar 2020. Search strategies applied the CADTH database guidelines search filter, with no limits applied to search results. Further studies were identified through searches of grey literature using the ISARIC network. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Clinical guidelines for the management of covid-19, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) produced by international and national scientific organisations and government and non-governmental organisations relating to global health were included, with no exclusions for language. Regional/hospital guidelines were excluded. Only the earliest version of any guideline was included. QUALITY ASSESSMENT: Quality was assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II tool. The quality and contents of early covid-19 guidelines were also compared with recent clinical guidelines for MERS and SARS. RESULTS: 2836 studies were identified, of which 2794 were excluded after screening. Forty two guidelines were considered eligible for inclusion, with 18 being specific to covid-19. Overall, the clinical guidelines lacked detail and covered a narrow range of topics. Recommendations varied in relation to, for example, the use of antiviral drugs. The overall quality was poor, particularly in the domains of stakeholder involvement, applicability, and editorial independence. Links between evidence and recommendations were limited. Minimal provision was made for vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, children, and older people. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines available early in the covid-19 pandemic had methodological weaknesses and neglected vulnerable groups such as older people. A framework for development of clinical guidelines during public health emergencies is needed to ensure rigorous methods and the inclusion of vulnerable populations. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42020167361.

Antibody Dependent Enhancement Due to Original Antigenic Sin and the Development of SARS

Human coronavirus (HCoV) is one of the most common causes of respiratory tract infections throughout the world. Two phenomena observed so far in the development of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic deserve further attention. First, the relative absence of clinical signs of infections in children, second, the early appearance of IgG in certain patients. From the point of view of immune system physiology, such an early rise of specific IgG is expected in secondary immune responses when memory to a cross-reactive antigen is present, usually from an earlier infection with a coronavirus. It is actually typical for the immune system to respond, to what it already knows, a phenomenon that has been observed in many infections with closely related viruses and has been termed "original antigenic sin." The question then arises whether such cross-reactive antibodies are protective or not against the new virus. The worst scenario would be when such cross-reactive memory antibodies to related coronaviruses would not only be non-protective but even enhance infection and the clinical course. Such a phenomenon of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) has already been described in several viral infections. Thus, the development of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in the course of COVID-19 might not be a simple sign of viral clearance and developing protection against the virus. On the contrary, due to cross-reaction to related coronavirus strains from earlier infections, in certain patients IgG might enhance clinical progression due to ADE. The patient's viral history of coronavirus infection might be crucial to the development of the current infection with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, it poses a note of caution when treating COVID-19 patients with convalescent sera.

Breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic: Suggestions on behalf of woman study group of AMD

SARS-Cov2 infection has recently spread to Italy with important consequences on pregnancy management, mother and child health and mother-child contact. Breastfeeding improves the health of mother and child and reduces risk of neonatal infection with other pathogens that are likely to cause serious illness. To date no evidence confirmed COVID-19 vertical transmission from infected pregnant mother to their fetus. However it is well known that an infected mother can transmit the COVID-19 virus through respiratory droplets during breastfeeding or intimate contact. Thus, the mothers with known or suspected COVID-19 should adhere to standard and contact precautions during breastfeeding. Woman Study Group of AMD, after reviewing current knowledge about COVID-19 vertical transmission and the compatibility of breastfeeding in COVID-19 mother, the available recommendations from Health Care Organizations and main experts opinions, issued the following suggestions on breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic, addressed both to mothers with and without diabetes. It should be considered that following suggestions may change in the future when more evidence is acquired regarding SARS-Cov2 infection.

Interleukin-22 level is negatively correlated with neutrophil recruitment in the lungs in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia model

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major threat for immune-compromised patients. Bacterial pneumonia can induce uncontrolled and massive neutrophil recruitment ultimately leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and epithelium damage. Interleukin-22 plays a central role in the protection of the epithelium. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the role of interleukin-22 and its soluble receptor IL-22BP in an acute Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia model in mice. In this model, we noted a transient increase of IL-22 during Pseudomonas aeruginosa challenge. Using an antibody-based approach, we demonstrated that IL-22 neutralisation led to increased susceptibility to infection and to lung damage correlated with an increase in neutrophil accumulation in the lungs. On the contrary, rIL-22 administration or IL-22BP neutralisation led to a decrease in mouse susceptibility and lung damage associated with a decrease in neutrophil accumulation. This study demonstrated that the IL-22/IL-22BP system plays a major role during Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia by moderating neutrophil accumulation in the lungs that ultimately leads to epithelium protection.

Effect on ovarian reserve of hemostasis by bipolar coagulation versus suture during laparoendoscopic single-site cystectomy for ovarian endometriomas.

STUDY OBJECTIVE To compare the postoperative decrease in ovarian reserve between hemostasis by bipolar coagulation and suture during laparoendoscopic single-site cystectomy (LESS-C) for ovarian endometriomas. DESIGN Prospective comparative study (Canadian Task Force Classification II-1). SETTING University hospital. PATIENTS One hundred twenty-five patients with ovarian endometriomas. INTERVENTIONS Patients with endometrioma were managed by hemostasis with either bipolar coagulation (n = 62) or suturing (n = 63) during LESS-C. We evaluated the impact of surgery on ovarian reserve using serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels, which were measured before surgery and 3 months after surgery in all patients. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS Baseline characteristics such as age, bilaterality of endometriomas, and preoperative AMH levels were similar between the 2 study groups. There were also no differences between the 2 groups in surgical outcomes, such as operative time, operative blood loss, or operative complications. In both study groups, postoperative AMH levels were lower than preoperative AMH levels (p < .001). The decline rate of AMH levels was significantly greater in the bipolar coagulation group than in the suture group (42.2% [interquartile range, 16.5%-53.0%] and 24.6% [interquartile range, 11.6%-37.0%], respectively, p = .001). CONCLUSION Hemostasis by bipolar coagulation after stripping of the endometrioma during LESS-C reduces ovarian reserve more than suturing does, as determined by serial AMH levels. Therefore, suturing may be a better hemostatic choice after stripping ovarian endometriomas.

Prospective epidemiological study of common colds and secretory otitis media

To evaluate how often a common cold induces secretory otitis media (SOM) two groups of young children were studied. One comprised 373 children aged 9 months to 7 years who were being minded in institutions. The other group consisted of 210 children not minded in day institutions or private day care. This latter group was subdivided into children minded at home or in private day care attended by not more than 2 children (117 children), and the remainder (93 children). Common colds were defined as nasal discharge, and tympanometry was carried out 6 times at 2‐week intervals. Among the 1‐year‐olds common colds induced SOM in 83% of those minded in institutions and in 56% of those minded at home. At the age of 5 years this applied to 20% of both groups.

Is administration of gadolinium-based contrast media to pregnant women and small children justified?

The use of gadolinium-based contrast media in pregnant or lactating women has been discouraged at many radiology departments due to the lack of knowledge of the risks for the fetus and the unwillingness to expose neonates to unnecessary drugs. In the present review the current literature and present guidelines regarding the use of gadolinium-based contrast media have been reviewed to validate the justification for their administration to pregnant or lactating women and small children.

Cross host transmission in the emergence of MERS coronavirus

Coronaviruses (CoVs) able to infect humans emerge through cross-host transmission from animals. There is substantial evidence that the recent Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV outbreak is fueled by zoonotic transmission from dromedary camels. This is largely based on the fact that closely related viruses have been isolated from this but not any other animal species. Given the widespread geographical distribution of dromedaries found seropositive for MERS-CoV, continued transmission may likely occur in the future. Therefore, a further understanding of the cross host transmission of MERS-CoV is needed to limit the risks this virus poses to man.

Brief recommendations on the management of adult patients with familial hypercholesterolemia during the COVID-19 pandemic

Individuals with Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) are at very high risk of cardiovascular disease, which is associated with poor outcomes from coronavirus infections. COVID-19 puts strain on healthcare systems and may impair access to routine FH services. On behalf of the International Lipid Expert Panel (ILEP) and the European FH Patient Network (FH Europe), we present brief recommendations on the management of adult patients with FH during the COVID-19 pandemic. We discuss the implications of COVID-19 infections for FH patients, the importance of continuing lipid-lowering therapy where possible, issues relating to safety monitoring and service delivery. We summarise the evidence for additional benefits of statins and other lipid-lowering drugs during viral infections. The recommendations do not override in any way the individual responsibility of physicians to make appropriate and accurate decisions taking into account the condition of a given patient and the doses, rules, and regulations applicable to drugs and devices at the time of their prescription/use.

Modernities, Sciences, and Democracy

The “modern” in “modern science” is a relatively uninterrogated and untheorized concept within the sciences and in the philosophy, sociology, and history of science. This is so today at a time when other aspects of Western sciences have been fruitfully explored in critical and illuminating ways (see Christensen and Hansen, Chap. 13; and Skovsmose, Chap. 15). In particular, the exceptionalism and triumphalism characteristic of Western attitudes toward our sciences have been explicitly criticized and purportedly abandoned by many of the scholars working in science studies fields. By exceptionalism is meant the belief that Western sciences alone among all human knowledge systems are capable of grasping reality in its own terms—that these alone have the resources to escape the human tendency to project onto nature cultural assumptions, fears, and desires. By triumphalism is meant the assumption that the history of science consists of a history of achievements — that this history has no significant downsides. According to this view, Hiroshima, environmental destruction, the alienation of labour, escalating global militarism, the increasing gap between the “haves” and the ”have nots,” gender, race, and class inequalities — these and other undesirable social situations are all entirely consequences of social and political projects, to which the history of Western sciences makes no contribution. Such conventional Euro centric assumptions can no longer gather the support either in the West or elsewhere that they could once claim In recent decades a huge amount of literature on modernity has emerged from the social sciences and humanities. Stimulated by the massive shifts in local and global social formations during the last half of the Twentieth Century, and by the post-modern response to such changes, social theorists, literary and other cultural critics, and, especially, historians have debated the uneven and complex origins, nature, and desirable futures of modernity, modernization, and modernism. Such controversies about modernity are first and foremost about a culture's relation to its past and its possible futures. They arise as ways of asking what went wrong, and what needs to be corrected. The last half a century has witnessed the global decline and fall of belief in the unquestionably legitimate authority of the white, bourgeois, male. Contributing to the epistemological, economic, political, and cultural rubble left by his demise — or, at least, deflation — have been compelling and influential counter-histories of social relations between the races, classes, genders, and within colonial and imperial eras

The role of non-formal education in combating the HIV epidemic in the Philippines and Taiwan

The Philippines is experiencing a low but slowly growing prevalence of HIV, with a UN estimate of 6,000–11,000 cases out of a population of 91 million, and a 150% increase in new cases in 2008 compared to previous years. Earlier education programmes employed non-formal educational training techniques in the southern Philippines to target high-risk groups such as female sex workers and their establishment managers; the effort was expanded to target males in the community. In comparison, as of 2009, Taiwan has an estimated 40,000 cases of HIV/AIDS in a population of 23 million. It experienced a major increase in HIV infection among injecting drug users, from 77 newly reported cases in 2003 to 2,381 such cases in 2007. This article compares and contrasts the response to the epidemic in each country, describing non-formal educational programmes targeted and tailored to specific high-risk populations.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis Pathogenesis, Infection Prevention and Treatment

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and it represents a persistent public health threat for a number of complex biological and sociological reasons. According to the most recent Global Tuberculosis Report (2019) edited by the World Health Organization (WHO), TB is considered the ninth cause of death worldwide and the leading cause of mortality by a single infectious agent, with the highest rate of infections and death toll rate mostly concentrated in developing and low-income countries. We present here the editorial section to the Special Issue entitled “Mycobacterium tuberculosis Pathogenesis, Infection Prevention and Treatment” that includes 7 research articles and a review. The scientific contributions included in the Special Issue mainly focus on the characterization of MTB strains emerging in TB endemic countries as well as on multiple mechanisms adopted by the bacteria to resist and to adapt to antitubercular therapies.

Infrared assessment of human facial temperature in the presence and absence of common cosmetics

Using a sensitive research-grade infrared camera, we find that common facial cosmetics and lotions mask skin temperature in assays of the human forehead. We test a family of 10 commonly-used cosmetic products and find that volatile liquids and creams lower thermal skin temperature by at least 2 C for up to 5-10 min and at least 1 C for up to 20 min, respectively. Powder and cream that contains brightening agent lower indefinitely the skin temperature sensed by infrared camera. With the qualification that these experiments were performed in a controlled laboratory setting rather than the mass crowd screening environment where infrared temperature sensing of humans sees widespread use, our tests suggest that for human subjects whose face was treated with certain cosmetics and lotions, infrared-based screening for elevated facial temperature (fever) can be unreliable.

Single cell RNA sequencing of 13 human tissues identify cell types and receptors of human coronaviruses

Abstract The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak from December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, has been declared a global public health emergency. Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. SARS-CoV-2 may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted “CellPhoneDB” analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.

Mesenchymal Stem Cell Derived Exosomes: a Nano Platform for Therapeutics and Drug Delivery in Combating COVID-19

The recent pandemic situation transpired due to coronavirus novel strain SARS-CoV-2 has become a global concern. This human coronavirus (HCov-19) has put the world on high alert as the numbers of confirmed cases are continuously increasing. The world is now fighting against this deadly virus and is leaving no stone unturned to find effective treatments through testing of various available drugs, including those effective against flu, malaria, etc. With an urgent need for the development of potential strategies, two recent studies from China using Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) to treat COVID-19 pneumonia have shed some light on a potential cure for the COVID-19 infected patients. However, MSCs, despite being used in various other clinical trials have always been questioned for their tendency to aggregate or form clumps in the injured or disease microenvironment. It has also been reported in various studies that exosomes secreted by these MSCs, contribute towards the cell’s biological and therapeutic efficacy. There have been reports evaluating the safety and feasibility of these exosomes in various lung diseases, thereby proposing them as a cell-free therapeutic agent. Also, attractive features like cell targeting, low-immunogenicity, safety, and high biocompatibility distinguish these exosomes from other synthetic nano-vesicles and thus potentiate their role as a drug delivery nano-platform. Building upon these observations, herein, efforts are made to give an overview of stem cell-derived exosomes as an appealing therapeutic agent and drug delivery nano-carrier. In this review, we briefly recapitulate the recent evidence and developments in understanding exosomes as a promising candidate for novel nano-intervention in the current pandemic scenario. Furthermore, this review will highlight and discuss mechanistic role of exosomes to combat severe lung pathological conditions. We have also attempted to dwell into the nano-formulation of exosomes for its better applicability, storage, and stability thereby conferring them as off the shelf therapeutic.

Genetic factors associated with response to as-needed aflibercept therapy for typical neovascular age-related macular degeneration and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.

In the present study, we investigated the association between susceptible genetic variants to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and response to as-needed intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI) therapy for exudative AMD including both typical neovascular AMD and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) over 12-months. A total of 234 patients with exudative AMD were initially treated with 3 monthly IAI and thereafter as-needed IAI over 12 months. Seven variants of 6 genes including ARMS2 A69S (rs10490924), CFH (I62V:rs800292 and rs1329428), C2-CFB-SKIV2L(rs429608), C3 (rs2241394), CETP (rs3764261) and ADAMTS-9 (rs6795735) were genotyped for all participants using TaqMan technology. After adjusting for age, gender, baseline BCVA and AMD subtype, A (protective) allele of C2-CFB-SKIV2L rs429608 was associated with visual improvement at 12-month (P = 0.003). Retreatment was associated with T(risk) allele of ARMS2 A69S (P = 2.0 × 10-4; hazard ratio: 2.18:95%CI: 1.47-3.24) and C(risk) allele of CFH rs1329428 (P = 2.0 × 10-3; hazard ratio: 1.74:95%CI: 1.16-2.59) after adjusting for the baseline confounders. The need for additional injections was also associated with T allele of ARMS2 A69S (P = 1.0 × 10-5) and C allele of CFH rs1329428 (P = 3.0 × 10-3) after adjusting for the baseline confounders. The variants of ARMS2 and CFH are informative for both physicians and patients to predict recurrence and to quantify the need for additional injections.

The effect of renal denervation on kidney oxygenation as determined by BOLD MRI in patients with hypertension.

OBJECTIVES Renal denervation (RDN) is a promising therapy for resistant hypertension. RDN is assumed to decrease sympathetic activity. Consequently, RDN can potentially increase renal oxygenation. Blood oxygen level-dependent MRI (BOLD-MRI) provides a non-invasive tool to determine renal oxygenation in humans. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of RDN on renal oxygenation as determined by BOLD-MRI. METHODS Patients with resistant hypertension or the inability to follow a stable drug regimen due to unacceptable side effects were included. BOLD-MRI was performed before and 12 months after RDN. Twenty-seven patients were imaged on 3 T and 19 on 1.5 T clinical MRI systems. RESULTS Fifty-four patients were included, 46 patients (23 men, mean age 57 years) completed the study. Mean 24-h BP changed from 163(±20)/98(±14) mmHg to 154(±22)/92(±13) mmHg (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001). eGFR did not change after RDN [77(±18) vs. 79(±20) mL/min/1.73 m(2); p = 0.13]. RDN did not affect renal oxygenation [1.5 T: cortical R2*: 12.5(±0.9) vs. 12.5(±0.9), p = 0.94; medullary R2*: 19.6(±1.7) vs. 19.3(1.4), p = 0.40; 3 T: cortical R2*: 18.1(±0.8) vs. 17.8(±1.2), p = 0.47; medullary R2*: 27.4(±1.9) vs. 26.7(±1.8), p = 0.19]. CONCLUSION The current study shows that RDN does not lead to changes in renal oxygenation 1 year after RDN as determined by BOLD-MRI. KEY POINTS • Renal denervation significantly decreased ambulatory blood pressure. • Renal denervation did not change renal oxygenation as determined by BOLD-MRI. • Absence of a change in renal oxygenation might be explained by autoregulation.

Limbic encephalitis after inhalation of a murine coronavirus.

The spread of a neurotropic coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain A59, in the mouse central nervous system was studied after intranasal inoculation. Mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 spread during the 3- to 5-day postinoculation period, through the olfactory pathway into the limbic system. Coronavirus particles were detected in the limbic system by electron microscopy. The combination of temporal propagation through an anatomical-physiological central nervous system pathway and anatomical restriction of viral infection suggests that specific interneuronal transport is important in spread of the virus. This experimental system may represent a model for diseases associated with human coronaviruses (common cold viruses) and/or the human limbic system.

Ergonomics of disposable handles for minimally invasive surgery.

BACKGROUND The ergonomic deficiencies of currently available minimally invasive surgery (MIS) instrument handles have been addressed in many studies. In this study, a new ergonomic pistol handle concept, realized as a prototype, and two disposable ring handles were investigated according to ergonomic properties set by new European standards. METHODS In this study, 25 volunteers performed four practical tasks to evaluate the ergonomics of the handles used in standard operating procedures (e.g., measuring a suture and cutting to length, precise maneuvering and targeting, and dissection of a gallbladder). Moreover, 20 participants underwent electromyography (EMG) tests to measure the muscle strain they experienced while carrying out the basic functions (grasp, rotate, and maneuver) in the x, y, and z axes. The data measured included the number of errors, the time required for task completion, perception of pressure areas, and EMG data. The values for usability in the test were effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction. Surveys relating to the subjective rating were completed after each task for each of the three handles tested. RESULTS Each handle except the new prototype caused pressure areas and pain. Extreme differences in muscle strain could not be observed for any of the three handles. Experienced surgeons worked more quickly with the prototype when measuring and cutting a suture (approximately 20%) and during precise maneuvering and targeting (approximately 20%). On the other hand, they completed the dissection task faster with the handle manufactured by Ethicon. Fewer errors were made with the prototype in dissection of the gallbladder. In contrast to the handles available on the market, the prototype was always rated as positive by the volunteers in the subjective surveys. CONCLUSIONS None of the handles could fulfil all of the requirements with top scores. Each handle had its advantages and disadvantages. In contrast to the ring handles, the volunteers could fulfil most of the tasks more efficiently using the prototype handle without any remarkable pressure areas, cramps, or pain.

Detection of small-bowel tumours with CT enteroclysis using carbon dioxide and virtual enteroscopy: A preliminary study.

PURPOSE The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the feasibility, tolerance and performance of virtual enteroscopy (VE) using carbon dioxide for small-bowel distension in patients with suspected small-bowel tumours (SBTs). PATIENTS AND METHODS After IRB approval, 17 patients with suspected SBTs were prospectively included. Radiation dose was compared to 34 matched patients (2 for 1) for age, gender and body weight, who had undergone CT-enteroclysis with neutral contrast (CTE). Performance of VE was evaluated through comparison with the current standard of reference, including surgery and/or enteroscopy and/or follow-up. RESULTS Tolerance was excellent in 16/17 patients (94%). The radiation dose was lower for VE than for CTE (533 ± 282 vs. 974 ± 505 mGy.cm; p = 0.002). With VE, a total of 25 polyps >5 mm in size were depicted in 12/17 patients. On a per-lesion analysis, sensitivity and positive predictive value of VE were 92.0% and 92.0%, respectively. On a per-segment analysis VE had a sensitivity and specificity of 95.0% and 87.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION Our preliminary study suggests that VE is a feasible and well-tolerated technique with high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of SBT. KEY POINTS • Virtual enteroscopy is feasible and well tolerated. • Virtual enteroscopy appears to be accurate for detection of small-bowel tumours. • Sensitivity and PPV of virtual enteroscopy is 92.0% and 92.0%. • Radiation dose is lower with virtual enteroscopy compared to MDCT-enteroclysis.

Posttraumatic stress symptoms of health care workers during the corona virus disease 2019

Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has attracted worldwide attention. The COVID-19 outbreak is unique in its rapid transmission and results in heavy stress for the front-line health care workers (HCWs). The current study aimed to exam posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs) of HCWs fighting for the COVID-19 and to evaluate their sleep quality after 1-month stressful suffering. Three hundred seventy-seven HCWs working in different provinces of China participated in the survey between February 1 and 5. The demographic information was collected first. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were selected to measure PTSSs and sleep quality. Results showed that 1 month after the outbreak, the prevalence of PTSSs was 3.8% in HCWs. Female HCWs were more vulnerable to PTSSs with hazard ratio of 2.136 (95% CI = 1.388-3.286). HCWs with higher exposure level also significantly rated more hyperarousal symptoms (hazard ratio = 4.026, 95% CI = 1.233-13.140). There was a significant difference of sleep quality between participants with and without PTSSs (z value = 6.014, p < .001) and among different groups with various contact frequencies (chi-square = 7.307, p = .026). Path analysis showed that there was a significant indirect effect from exposure level to PTSSs through sleep quality (coefficient = 1.750, 95% CI of Boostroop test = 0.543-2.998). In summary, targeted interventions on sleep contribute to the mental recovery during the outbreak of COVID-19. Understanding the mental health response after a public health emergency might help HCWs and communities prepare for a population's response to disaster.

Structure, Function, and Evolution of Coronavirus Spike Proteins.

The coronavirus spike protein is a multifunctional molecular machine that mediates coronavirus entry into host cells. It first binds to a receptor on the host cell surface through its S1 subunit and then fuses viral and host membranes through its S2 subunit. Two domains in S1 from different coronaviruses recognize a variety of host receptors, leading to viral attachment. The spike protein exists in two structurally distinct conformations, prefusion and postfusion. The transition from prefusion to postfusion conformation of the spike protein must be triggered, leading to membrane fusion. This article reviews current knowledge about the structures and functions of coronavirus spike proteins, illustrating how the two S1 domains recognize different receptors and how the spike proteins are regulated to undergo conformational transitions. I further discuss the evolution of these two critical functions of coronavirus spike proteins, receptor recognition and membrane fusion, in the context of the corresponding functions from other viruses and host cells.

Reaction‐Superdiffusion Systems in Epidemiology, an Application of Fractional Calculus

Spatially extended stochastic processes in epidemiology lead to classical reaction‐diffusion process, when infection spreads only locally. This notion can be generalized using fractional derivatives, especially fractional Laplacian operators, leading to Lévy flights and sub‐ or super‐diffusion. Especially super‐diffusion is a more realistic mechanism of spreading epidemics than ordinary diffusion.

Asthma and COVID-19 in children: A systematic review and call for data

RATIONALE: Whether asthma constitutes a risk factor for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. Here, we aimed to assess whether asthma, the most common chronic disease in children, is associated with higher COVID-19 risk or severity in pediatric populations. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search in three stages: first, we reviewed PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL for systematic reviews of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 in pediatric populations, and reviewed their primary articles; second, we searched PubMed for studies on COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 and asthma/wheeze, and evaluated whether the resulting studies included pediatric populations; third, we repeated the second search in BioRxiv.org and MedRxiv.org to find pre-prints that may have information on pediatric asthma. RESULTS: In the first search, eight systematic reviews were found, of which five were done in pediatric populations; none of the 67 primary studies included data on pediatric asthma as a comorbidity for COVID-19. In the second search, we found 34 results in PubMed, of which five reported asthma in adults, but none included data on children. In the third search, 25 pre-prints in MedRxiv included data on asthma, but none on children. We found one report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stating that 40/345 (~11.5%) children with data on chronic conditions had "chronic lung diseases including asthma," and one from a tertiary hospital in New York that reported asthma in 11/46 (~23.9%) children hospitalized for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: There is scarcely any data on whether childhood asthma (or other pediatric respiratory diseases) constitute risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 severity. Studies are needed that go beyond counting the number of cases in the pediatric age range.

Binding and entry of animal viruses

Viruses are infectious agents capable of packaging and delivering nucleic acids and proteins to specific populations of cells. To initiate infection, viruses bind to sites, or receptors, on the cell surface and transfer their genome across the limiting membrane of the cell. The mechanisms underlying these events, and viral tropism for particular host cells, are becoming increasingly well understood. Several cell surface proteins have now been identified as viral receptors, and analyses of intact virus particles and sub-viral components are revealing the structures of the binding determinants on the viruses themselves. For many viruses, the events leading to penetration and delivery involve constitutive endocytic properties of the host cell, and the low pH environment in endocytic compartments is a crucial trigger in the penetration process. The knowledge of viral tropism, binding and entry suggests strategies which may be applied to the design of targeted therapeutic agents with appropriate specificities and effective delivery mechanisms.

Characterisation of the faecal virome of captive and wild Tasmanian devils using virus-like particles metagenomics and meta-transcriptomics

The Tasmanian devil is an endangered carnivorous marsupial threatened by devil facial tumour disease (DFTD). While research on DFTD has been extensive, little is known about the viruses present in devils, and whether any of these are of potential conservation relevance for this endangered species. Using both metagenomics based on virus-like particle (VLP) enrichment and sequence-independent amplification (VLP metagenomics), and meta-transcriptomics based on bulk RNA sequencing, we characterised and compared the faecal viromes of captive and wild Tasmanian devils. A total of 54 devil faecal samples collected from captive (n = 2) and wild (n = 4) populations were processed for virome characterisation using both approaches. We detected many novel, highly divergent viruses, including vertebrate viruses, bacteriophage and other dietary associated plant and insect viruses. In total, 18 new vertebrate viruses, including novel sapelovirus, astroviruses, bocaviruses, papillomaviruses and gammaherpesvirus were identified, as well as known mammalian pathogens including rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2). Captive devils showed significantly lower levels of viral diversity than wild devils. Comparison of the two methodological approaches revealed substantial differences in the number and types of viruses detected, with meta-transcriptomics mainly identifying RNA viruses, and VLP metagenomics largely identifying DNA viruses. This study has greatly expanded our knowledge of eukaryotic viruses in the Tasmanian devil and provides important baseline information that will contribute to the conservation and captive management of this endangered species. In addition, our results showed that a combination of VLP metagenomics and meta-transcriptomics may be a more comprehensive approach to virome characterisation than either method alone.

PrivyTRAC: Privacy and Security Preserving Contact Tracing System

Smartphone location-based methods have been proposed and implemented as an effective alternative to traditional labor intensive contact tracing methods. However, there are serious privacy and security concerns that may impede wide-spread adoption in many societies. Furthermore, these methods rely solely on proximity to patients, based on Bluetooth or GPS signal for example, ignoring lingering effects of virus, including COVID-19, present in the environment. This results in inaccurate risk assessment and incomplete contact tracing. A new system concept, called PrivyTRAC, preserves user privacy, increases security and improves accuracy of smartphone contact tracing. PrivyTRAC enhances users' and patients' privacy by letting users conduct self-evaluation based on the risk maps download to their smartphones. No user information is transmitted to external locations or devices, and no personally identifiable patient information is embedded in the risk maps as they are processed anonymized and aggregated locations of confirmed patients. The risk maps consider both spatial proximity and temporal effects to improve the accuracy of the infection risk estimation. Experiments conducted in the paper illustrate improvement of PrivyTRAC over proximity based methods in terms of true and false positives. An approach to further improve infection risk estimation by incorporating both positive and negative local test results from contacts of confirmed cases is also described.

Falls and fear of falling in older adults with total joint arthroplasty: a scoping review.

BACKGROUND Patients waiting or recovering from total joint arthroplasty (TJA) are at risk for falls which can lead to restriction of activity and negatively impact recovery. The objective of this scoping review is to critically appraise and synthesize the evidence in the reported number of falls, fear of falling, and risk factors associated with falls in older patients waiting for or recovering from TJA. METHODS Seven electronic databases were searched with no date limits and using language restriction (English). The inclusion criteria were 1) cohorts that included older adults 60+ years of age, 2) reported prevalence of falls, fear of falling, and/or risk factors for falls in patients who were waiting or recovering from TJA and 3) cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, and case control study designs. The quality assessment of selected articles was assessed using the SIGN Guidelines Checklist. RESULTS Of the 866 citations identified, 12 studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Prevalence of falls in pre-operative TJA patients and post-operative TJA patients ranged from 23 to 63%, and 13 to 42%, respectively. Of those five studies that examined fear of falling, pre-operative TJA patients reported greater fear of falling than post-operative patients. Modifiable risk factors for falls included fear of falling, joint range of motion, and depression. CONCLUSIONS An increased risk of falls in patients with TJA was reported both for patients waiting for and recovering from surgery. A number of modifiable risk factors were identified including fear of falling that could be targeted in fall prevention programs for TJA.

SILS sigmoidectomy versus multiport laparoscopic sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES In this single-institution study, we aimed to compare the safety, feasibility, and outcomes of single-incision laparoscopic sigmoidectomy (SILSS) with multiport laparoscopic sigmoidectomy (MLS) for recurrent diverticulitis. METHODS Between October 2011 and February 2013, 60 sigmoidectomies were performed by the same surgeon. Forty patients had a MLS and 20 patients had a SILSS. Outcomes were compared. RESULTS Patient characteristics were similar. There was no difference in morbidity, mortality or readmission rates. The mean operative time was longer in the SILSS group (P=.0012). In a larger proportion of patients from the SILSS group, 2 linear staplers were needed for transection at the rectum (P=.006). The total cost of disposable items was higher in the SILSS group (P<.0001). No additional ports were placed in the SILSS group. Return to bowel function or return to oral intake was faster in the SILSS group (P=.0446 and P=.0137, respectively). Maximum pain scores on postoperative days 1 and 2 were significantly less for the SILSS group (P=.0014 and P=.047, respectively). Hospital stay was borderline statistically shorter in the SILSS group (P=.0053). SILSS was also associated with better cosmesis (P<.0011). CONCLUSION SILSS is feasible and safe and is associated with earlier recovery of bowel function, a significant reduction in postoperative pain, and better cosmesis.

Percutaneous vertebroplasty for pain management in patients with multiple myeloma: is radiofrequency ablation necessary?

PURPOSE This study was designed to investigate the added role of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to vertebroplasty on the pain management of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). METHODS Thirty-six patients (51-82 years) with vertebral localization of MM were randomly divided into two groups: 18 patients (group A) who underwent RFA and then vertebroplasty, and 18 patients (group B) who underwent only vertebroplasty. Primary endpoints were technical success and pain relief score rate measured by the visual analogue pain scores (VAS) and Roland-Morris Questionnaire (RMQ); secondary endpoint was the amount of administered analgesia. Survival and complications were compared. RESULTS Technical success was 100 % in both groups. The VAS score (at 24 h and 6 weeks postprocedure) decreased in equal manner for both groups from a mean of 9.1-3.4 and 2.0 for group A and from a mean of 9.3-3.0 and 2.3 for group B; RMQ mean score was 19.8 for group A and 19.9 for group B and decreased to a mean of 9.6 and 8.2 for group A and 9.5 and 8.7 for group B. The amount of medication was equally decreased in the two groups. No statistically significant difference was noted. No major complication occurred and two patients died from other causes. CONCLUSIONS The use of percutaneous vertebroplasty alone appears to be effective for the pain management of the patients with vertebral involvement of multiple myeloma. The use of RFA that includes cost and time does not offer any clear added benefit on the midterm pain management of such patients.

Pharmacological Effects of Scutellarin, An Active Component of Genus Scutellaria and Erigeron: A Systematic Review.

Flavonoid compound scutellarin (Scu) is quite frequently met in the plant kingdom, particularly in the genus Scutellaria (Lamiaceae) and Erigeron (Asteraceae). The extract of the herb of Erigeron breviscapus, containing this component in high amount, has been used for many years in traditional Chinese medicine. In recent years, studies have made great progress on the usefulness of Scu for treating various diseases by testing its mechanism of action. They support the traditional use of Scu rich plant in heart and cerebral ischemia. Scu can potentially be applied in Alzheimer's disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, vascular complications of diabetes and as an inhibitor of certain carcinomas. Various methods were designed to improve its isolation from plant material, solubility, absorption and bioavailability. On the basis of recent studies, it is suggested that Scu could be a promising candidate for new natural drug and deserves particular attention in further research and development.

Origin, Evolution, and Genotyping of Emergent Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Strains in the United States

Coronaviruses are known to infect humans and other animals and cause respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. Here we report the emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in the United States and determination of its origin, evolution, and genotypes based on temporal and geographical evidence. Histological lesions in small intestine sections of affected pigs and the complete genomic sequences of three emergent strains of PEDV isolated from outbreaks in Minnesota and Iowa were characterized. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the three U.S. strains revealed a close relationship with Chinese PEDV strains and their likely Chinese origin. The U.S. PEDV strains underwent evolutionary divergence, which can be classified into two sublineages. The three emergent U.S. strains are most closely related to a strain isolated in 2012 from Anhui Province in China, which might be the result of multiple recombination events between different genetic lineages or sublineages of PEDV. Molecular clock analysis of the divergent time based on the complete genomic sequences is consistent with the actual time difference, approximately 2 to 3 years, of the PED outbreaks between China (December 2010) and the United States (May 2013). The finding that the emergent U.S. PEDV strains share unique genetic features at the 5′-untranslated region with a bat coronavirus provided further support of the evolutionary origin of PEDV from bats and potential cross-species transmission. The data from this study have important implications for understanding the ongoing PEDV outbreaks in the United States and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures against PEDV.

Recomendaciones de «hacer¼ y «no hacer¼ en el tratamiento de los pacientes críticos ante la pandemia por coronavirus causante de COVID-19 de los Grupos de Trabajo de la Sociedad Española de Medicina Intensiva, Crítica y Unidades Coronarias (SEMICYUC)./ Recomendaciones de «hacer¼ y «no hacer¼ en el tratamiento de los pacientes críticos ante la pandemia por coronavirus causante de COVID-19 de los Grupos de Trabajo de la Sociedad Española de Medicina Intensiva, Crítica y Unidades Coronarias (SEMICYUC)./ Recommendations of the Working Groups from the Spanish Society of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine and Coronary Units (SEMICYUC) for the management of adult critically ill patients in the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)

On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) as a pandemic. The spread and evolution of the pandemic is overwhelming the healthcare systems of dozens of countries and has led to a myriad of opinion papers, contingency plans, case series and emerging trials. Covering all this literature is complex. Briefly and synthetically, in line with the previous recommendations of the Working Groups, the Spanish Society of Intensive, Critical Medicine and Coronary Units (SEMICYUC) has prepared this series of basic recommendations for patient care in the context of the pandemic.

Effect of autologous platelet-rich plasma in combination with bovine porous bone mineral and bio-guide membrane on bone regeneration in mandible bicortical bony defects.

OBJECTIVE Growth factors contained in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) can induce osteoblast differentiation in certain studies, whereas in others, osteogenesis of PRP on mandible bone defects has not been proved clinically. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of autologous PRP on the osteogenic potential of combining bovine porous bone mineral (BPBM) and bio-guide membrane (BGM) in promoting mandible bicortical bony defects in rabbits. METHODS One circular mandible bicortical bony defects were created in each of 54 rabbits, which were divided into 3 groups: group 1: 18 of the defects were left unfilled as a negative control; group 2: 18 of the defects were grafted with autologous PRP and BPBM/BGM; group 3: 18 of the defects were grafted with BPBM/BGM without PRP. Animals were killed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after operation. Harvested tissue and specimens were evaluated histologically and radiographically, and metabolized observation was performed. Histological parameters associated with osteoblast activities, bone trabecula, neovascularization, newly formed mineralized bone, rudimental grafts and connective tissue formation were measured. Densities of the bones at 4, 8, and 12 weeks were studied by radiographic. The bone defect closure ratio was measured at 12 weeks. The bone metabolized parameter alkaline phosphatase was also measured and compared between 4, 8, and 12 weeks. RESULTS The platelet concentration of PRP is 4.19- to 4.43-fold to that of the whole blood. Histological analysis showed new bone formation at all therapeutic sites including BPBM/BGM grafts with or without PRP. A statistically significant difference in new bone formation between group PRP/BPBM/BGM and group BPBM/BGM was observed. Untreated defects of group control showed the less bone regeneration. There was significant difference of bone density between group PRP/BPBM/BGM and control, and group BPBM/BGM and control, at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperative. There were more bone defects filling, and the grafts were absorbed at 12 weeks of group PRP/BPBM/BGM compared with group BPBM/BGM. Defects treated with PRP/BPBM/BGM demonstrated significantly increased activity of osteoblasts, enhanced amount of mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum in osteoblasts, and increased concentration of alkaline phosphatase at 4, 8, and 12 weeks compared with those treated with BPBM/BGM and control group. Complete closure ratio of bone defects treated with PRP/BPBM/BGM (50%) was significantly increased compared with that treated with BPBM/BGM (16.6%). CONCLUSIONS The study suggested that PRP combination of BPBM and BGM had significant therapeutic effects on mandible bicortical bony defects of rabbits. The effects are associated with the high concentration of platelet in PRP and the porous configuration of BPBM. Although we cannot reveal the detailed statistical relationship of PRP on promoting BPBM/GBM osteoinductive effects, PRP demonstrated superior results of bone regeneration.

Effects of interventions with a physical activity component on bone health in obese children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Given the rise in pediatric obesity, clarifications on the relationship between obesity and bone health and on the impact of structured intervention on this relationship are needed. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the effect of obesity on bone health and assessed the effect of structured intervention in children and adolescents with obesity. Medline complete, OVID, CINAHL, EMBASE and PubMed databases were searched for studies on obesity and bone health variables up to September 2016, then an update occurred in March 2016. Search items included obesity, childhood, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and peripheral quantitative computed tomography. Twenty-three studies (14 cross-sectional and nine longitudinal) matched the inclusion criteria. Results from the meta-analysis (cross-sectional studies) confirmed that children and adolescents with obesity have higher bone content and density than their normal weight peers. Results from longitudinal studies remain inconclusive as only 50% of the included studies reported a positive effect of a structured intervention program on bone health. As such, the meta-analysis reported that structured intervention did not influence bone markers despite having beneficial effects on general health in youth with obesity.

Management of orthopaedic and traumatology patients during the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in northern Italy

PURPOSE: This article aims to share northern Italy's experience in hospital re-organization and management of clinical pathways for traumatic and orthopaedic patients in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Authors collected regional recommendations to re-organize the healthcare system during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, 2020. The specific protocols implemented in an orthopaedic hospital, selected as a regional hub for minor trauma, are analyzed and described in this article. RESULTS: Two referral centres were identified as the hubs for minor trauma to reduce the risk of overload in general hospitals. These two centres have specific features: an emergency room, specialized orthopaedic surgeons for joint diseases and trauma surgeons on-call 24/7. Patients with trauma without the need for a multi-disciplinary approach or needing non-deferrable elective orthopaedic surgery were moved to these hospitals. Authors report the internal protocols of one of these centres. All elective surgery was stopped, outpatient clinics limited to emergencies and specific pathways, ward and operating theatre dedicated to COVID-19-positive patients were implemented. An oropharyngeal swab was performed in the emergency room for all patients needing to be admitted, and patients were moved to a specific ward with single rooms to wait for the results. Specific courses were organized to demonstrate the correct use of personal protection equipment (PPE). CONCLUSION: The structure of the orthopaedic hubs, and the internal protocols proposed, could help to improve the quality of assistance for patients with musculoskeletal disorders and reduce the risk of overload in general hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19 and the re-opening of schools: a policy maker's dilemma

The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and rapidly spread across the world. In order to counter this epidemic, several countries put in place different restrictive measures, such as the school's closure and a total lockdown. However, as the knowledge on the disease progresses, clinical evidence showed that children mainly have asymptomatic or mild disease and it has been suggested that they are also less likely to spread the virus. Moreover, the lockdown and the school closure could have negative consequences on children, affecting their social life, their education and their mental health. As many countries have already entered or are planning a phase of gradual lifting of the containment measures of social distancing, it seems plausible that the re-opening of nursery schools and primary schools could be considered a policy to be implemented at an early stage of recovery efforts, putting in place measures to do it safely, such as the maintenance of social distance, the reorganisation of classes into smaller groups, the provision of adequate sanitization of spaces, furniture and toys, the prompt identification of cases in the school environment and their tracing. Therefore, policy makers have the task of balancing pros and cons of the school re-opening strategy, taking into account psychological, educational and social consequences for children and their families. Another issue to be considered is represented by socio-economic disparities and inequalities which could be amplified by school's closure.

Replication and transcription of HCV 229E replicons. p6.

Replicons based upon the human coronavirus 229E (HCV 229E) genome were transfected into HCV 229E infected cells. We demonstrate that a synthetic RNA comprised of 646 nucloetides from the 5' end and 1465 nucloetides from the 3' end of the HCV 229E genome is replication competent. We conclude that the cis-acting elements necessary for replication are located in these 5' and 3' genomic regions. Furthermore, we inserted the intergenic region of the HCV 229E nucleocapsid protein gene into this basic construct and were able to demonstrate the transcription of "subgenomic" RNAs.

Fatal arrhythmias: Another reason why doctors remain cautious about chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19

BACKGROUND: Early during the current coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) received a significant amount of attention as a potential antiviral treatment, such that it became one of the most commonly prescribed medications for COVID-19 patients. However, not only has the effectiveness of HCQ remained questionable, but mainly based on preclinical and a few small clinical studies, HCQ is known to be potentially arrhythmogenic, especially as a result of QT prolongation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the arrhythmic effects of HCQ, as the heightened risk is especially relevant to COVID-19 patients, who are at higher risk for cardiac complications and arrhythmias at baseline. METHODS: An optical mapping technique utilizing voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes was used to determine the arrhythmic effects of HCQ in ex vivo guinea pig and rabbit hearts perfused with the upper therapeutic serum dose of HCQ (1000 ng/mL). RESULTS: HCQ markedly increased action potential dispersion, resulted in development of repolarization alternans, and initiated polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. CONCLUSION: The study results further highlight the proarrhythmic effects of HCQ.

And the beat goes on. The continued trials and tribulations of passenger rail franchising in Great Britain

Abstract National rail passenger services in Great Britain have been largely delivered by a system of franchising since 1996. As reported at previous Thredbo Conferences, this system has had several iterations and a number of failures, with one franchise (for the East Coast) having failed three times. This paper will use national level and operator specific data provided by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) to review recent key trends in rail demand and supply. It will extend an existing modelling framework to determine the costs and benefits of rail franchising at the national level. It will also undertake case studies of two franchises, for the East Coast and South West. In advance of the on-going Williams Review, policy prescriptions will be suggested for both the commercial and the social railway with particular reference to contract specifications.

Isolation and characterization of Salt Overly Sensitive family genes in spinach.

The Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway regulates intracellular sodium ion homeostasis as a salt-stress response in plants. This pathway involves three main genes designated as SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3, which are members of the Na+ /H+ exchanger (NHX), CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK), and Calcineurin B-like (CBL) gene families, respectively. To identify and characterize SOS genes in spinach (Spinacia oleracea), a species of the Amaranthaceae family, we conducted genome-wide identification and phylogenetic analyses of NHX, CIPK, and CBL genes from four Amaranthaceae species, Arabidopsis, and rice. Most Amaranthaceae genes exhibited orthologous relationships with Arabidopsis and/or rice, except a clade of Vac-type Amaranthaceae NHX genes. Phylogenetic analyses also revealed gene gain/loss events in Amaranthaceae species and the intron-less to intron-rich evolution of CIPK genes. A bacterial protein-rooted CIPK tree allowed naming most of the phylogenetic clades based on their evolutionary history. Single S. oleracea (So) SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3 proteins were identified. Direct protein-protein interaction was observed between SoSOS2 and SoSOS3 but not between SoSOS2 and SoSOS1 based on yeast two-hybrid assay. This may suggest distinct modes of action of spinach SOS proteins compared to Arabidopsis SOS proteins. Unlike SoSOS1 and SoSOS2, which were expressed at similar or higher levels in leaves than roots, SoSOS3 expression was significantly higher in roots than leaves, suggesting its greater importance in roots. The expression of SoSOS3 was upregulated in both roots and leaves under salinity compared to the control; however, SoSOS1 was only upregulated in roots. Thus, this study demonstrated the conservation of SOS pathway genes in spinach and also highlighted the complexity of SOS signaling in Amaranthaceae species. This article is protected by copyright.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pharmacology, and COVID-19 infection

Summary Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have an optional prescription status that has resulted in frequent use, in particular for the symptomatic treatment of fever and non-rheumatic pain. In 2019, a multi-source analysis of complementary pharmacological data showed that using NSAIDs in these indications (potentially indicative of an underlying infection) increases the risk of a severe bacterial complication, in particular in the case of lung infections. First, the clinical observations of the French Pharmacovigilance Network showed that severe bacterial infections can occur even after a short NSAID treatment, and even if the NSAID is associated with an antibiotic. Second, pharmacoepidemiological studies, some of which minimized the protopathic bias, all converged and confirmed the risk. Third, experimental in vitro and in vivo animal studies suggest several biological mechanisms, which strengthens a causal link beyond the well-known risk of delaying the care of the infection (immunomodulatory effects, effects on Streptococcus pyogenes infections, and reduced antibiotics efficacy). Therefore, in case of infection, symptomatic treatment with NSAIDs for non-severe symptoms (fever, pain, or myalgia) is not to be recommended, given a range of clinical and scientific arguments supporting an increased risk of severe bacterial complication. Besides, the existence of a safer drug alternative, with paracetamol at recommended doses, makes this recommendation of precaution and common sense even more legitimate. In 2020, such recommendation is more topical than ever with the emergence of COVID-19, especially since it results in fever, headaches, muscular pain, and cough, and is further complicated with pneumopathy, and given experimental data suggesting a link between ibuprofen and the level of expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.

Effects of social distancing on the spreading of COVID-19 inferred from mobile phone data

A better understanding of how the COVID-19 epidemic responds to social distancing efforts is required for the control of future outbreaks and to calibrate partial lock-downs. We present quantitative relationships between key parameters characterizing the COVID-19 epidemiology and social distancing efforts of nine selected European countries. Epidemiological parameters were extracted from the number of daily deaths data, while mitigation efforts are estimated from mobile phone tracking data. The decrease of the basic reproductive number (R0) as well as the duration of the initial exponential expansion phase of the epidemic strongly correlates with the magnitude of mobility reduction. Utilizing these relationships we decipher the relative impact of the timing and the extent of social distancing on the total death burden of the epidemic.

Approximate Decision Tree Induction over Approximately Engineered Data Features

We propose a simple SQL-based decision tree induction algorithm which makes its heuristic choices how to split the data basing on the results of automatically generated analytical queries. We run this algorithm using standard SQL and the approximate SQL engine which works on granulated data summaries. We compare the accuracy of trees obtained in these two modes on the real-world dataset provided to participants of the Suspicious Network Event Recognition competition organized at IEEE BigData 2019. We investigate whether trees induced using approximate SQL queries – although execution of such queries is incomparably faster – may yield poorer accuracy than in the standard scenario. Next, we investigate features – inputs to the decision tree induction algorithm – derived using SQL from a bigger associated data table which was provided in the aforementioned competition too. As before, we run standard and approximate SQL, although again, that latter mode needs to be checked with respect to the accuracy of trees learnt over the data with approximately extracted features.

Structure analysis of the receptor binding of 2019-nCoV

2019-nCoV is a newly identified coronavirus with high similarity to SARS-CoV. We performed a structural analysis of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein responsible for entry of coronaviruses into host cells. The RBDs from the two viruses share 72% identity in amino acid sequences, and molecular simulation reveals highly similar ternary structures. However, 2019-nCoV has a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues replacing rigid prolyl residues in SARS-CoV. Molecular modeling revealed that 2019-nCoV RBD has a stronger interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A unique phenylalanine F486 in the flexible loop likely plays a major role because its penetration into a deep hydrophobic pocket in ACE2. ACE2 is widely expressed with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom from fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, to mammals. Structural analysis suggests that ACE2 from these animals can potentially bind RBD of 2019-nCoV, making them all possible natural hosts for the virus. 2019-nCoV is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. However, since ACE2 is predominantly expressed in intestines, testis, and kidney, fecal-oral and other routes of transmission are also possible. Finally, antibodies and small molecular inhibitors that can block the interaction of ACE2 with RBD should be developed to combat the virus.

Modelling Emerging Viral Epidemics for Public Health Protection

Mathematical models when applied to infectious disease data can provide extremely useful insights into the possible future impacts of potential emerging epidemics and how they might be best controlled or mitigated. Modelling, which is like any other hypothesis-driven approach, aims to develop a better understanding of biological phenomena. However, diseases processes generally, and particularly those related to transmission, will in many cases be imperfectly understood or too complex to systematically describe, so models will necessarily be simplifications of the overall system. It is essential, therefore, that models are designed carefully and used appropriately. Key to this is identifying what specific questions a model might be expected to answer and what data is available to inform the model. A particular type of model might be fine for one particular situation but highly inappropriate for another. It is also important to appreciate and communicate what simplifications and assumptions have had to be made and how this might affect the robustness of the modelling results. It is also particularly important to understand that models frequently make what can be hidden assumptions about underlying processes because of the way they have been constructed and these assumptions also need to be carefully considered and made explicit, particularly for non-expert audiences. This chapter, therefore, provides a brief introduction to some of these aspects of epidemic modelling for those that might be less familiar with them.

Intubation Containment System for Improved Protection From Aerosolized Particles During Airway Management

Objectives: Worldwide efforts to protect front line providers performing endotracheal intubation during the COVID-19 pandemic have led to innovative devices. Authors evaluated the aerosol containment effectiveness of a novel intubation aerosol containment system (IACS) compared with a recently promoted intubation box and no protective barrier. Methods: In a simulation center at the authors’ university, the IACS was compared to no protective barrier and an intubation box. Aerosolization was simulated using a commercial fog machine and leakage of aerosolize mist was visually assessed. Results: The IACS appeared to contain the aerosolized mist, while the intubation box allowed for mist to contact the laryngoscopist and contaminate the clinical space through arm port holes and the open caudal end. Both devices protected the laryngoscopist better than no protective barrier. Discussion: The IACS with integrated sleeves and plastic drape appears to offer superior protection for the laryngoscopist and assistant providers from aerosolized particles.

Suspected sphenoid bone osteomyelitis causing visual impairment in two dogs and one cat

Objective To present the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of sphenoid bone osteomyelitis. Procedures Two dogs (English Springer Spaniel – ESS, Golden Retriever – GR) and one cat (Domestic Long Haired) were presented with a 2–14‐day history of visual deficits and reduced pupillary light reflexes. Investigations included physical, ophthalmologic and neurological examination as well as hematology, serum biochemistry, MRI of the head and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Results MRI changes included thickening of the sphenoid bone and a loss of normal bone marrow signal on T1W MRI. Enhancement of the sphenoid bones, ventral meninges and ventral surface of the brain was present using paramagnetic contrast medium. CSF analysis was abnormal in the two dogs with increased cellularity, neutrophilic pleocytosis, intracellular bacteria and increased total protein in one, and with lymphocytic pleocytosis in another. CSF analysis was normal in the cat. An underlying cause for the osteomyelitis could not be identified. The use of broad‐spectrum antibiotics for 3–6 weeks combined with anti‐inflammatory medications proved effective. Full clinical recovery occurred with no relapse during the follow up time of 7 (ESS) and 4 (Domestic Long Haired) years. The GR relapsed 10 months after treatment and recovered following a second 3‐week course of broad‐spectrum antibiotics with no relapse during the following 3 years. Conclusion Visual pathway deficits in dogs and cats may be due to sphenoid bone osteomyelitis. MRI and CSF analysis can assist diagnosing this potentially treatable condition. To the authors’ knowledge this is the first report of sphenoid bone osteomyelitis in these species.

Anaesthesia and COVID-19: infection control

The world is currently facing an unprecedented healthcare crisis caused by a pandemic novel beta coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pathogen is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets exposure and contact transfer, causing mild symptoms in the majority of cases, but critical illness, bilateral viral pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a minority. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary public healthcare intervention used. The pace of transmission and global scale of SARS-CoV-2 infections has implications for strategic oversight, resource management, and responsiveness in infection control. This article presents a summary of learning points in epidemiological infection control from the SARS epidemic, alongside a review of evidence connecting current understanding of the virologic and environmental contamination properties of SARS-CoV-2. We present suggestions for how personal protective equipment policies relate to the viral pandemic context and how the risk of transmission by and to anaesthetists, intensivists, and other healthcare workers can be minimised.

A Very Flat Peak: Exponential growth phase of COVID-19 is mostly followed by a prolonged linear growth phase, not an immediate saturation

When actively taking measures to control an epidemic, an important indicator of success is crossing the "peak" of daily new infections. The peak is a positive sign which marks the end of the exponential phase of infection spread and a transition into a phase that is a manageable. Most countries or provinces with similar but independent growth trajectories had taken drastic measures for containing the COVID-19 pandemic and are eagerly waiting to cross the peak. However, the data after many weeks of strict measures suggests that most provinces instead enter a phase where the infections are in a linear growth. While the transition out of an exponential phase is relieving, the roughly constant number of daily new infections differ widely, range from around 50 in Singapore to around 2000 just in Lombardy (Italy), and 7600 in Spain. The daily new infection rate of a region seems to depend heavily on the time point in the exponential evolution when the restrictive measures were adopted, rather than on the population of the region. It is not easy to point the critical source of these persistent infections. We attempt to interpret this data using a simple model of newer infections mediated by asymptomatic patients, which underscores the importance of actively identifying any potential leakages in the quarantine. Given the novelty of the virus, it is hard to predict too far into the future and one needs to be observant to see if a plan B is needed as a second round of interventions. So far, the peak achieved by most countries with the first round of intervention is extremely flat.

SARS-CoV-2 triggered neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) mediate COVID-19 pathology

Severe COVID-19 patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome that may progress to respiratory failure. These patients also develop cytokine storm syndrome, and organ dysfunctions, which is a clinical picture that resembles sepsis. Considering that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been described as an important factors of tissue damage in sepsis, we investigated whether NETs would be produced in COVID-19 patients and participate in the lung tissue damage. A cohort of 32 hospitalized patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and respective healthy controls were enrolled. NETs concentration was assessed by MPO-DNA PicoGreen assay or by confocal immunofluorescence. The cytotoxic effect of SARS-CoV-2-induced NETs was analyzed in human epithelial lung cells (A549 cells). The concentration of NETs was augmented in plasma and tracheal aspirate from COVID-19 patients and their neutrophils spontaneously released higher levels of NETs. NETs were also found in the lung tissue specimens from autopsies of COVID-19 patients. Notably, viable SARS-CoV-2 can directly induce in vitro release of NETs by healthy neutrophils in a PAD-4-dependent manner. Finally, NETs released by SARS-CoV-2-activated neutrophils promote lung epithelial cell death in vitro. These results unravel a possible detrimental role of NETs in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Therefore, the inhibition of NETs represent a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.

Medical Management and Diagnostic Approaches

This chapter reviews the basic principles of medical management of rat colonies and diagnostic approaches to detect infectious diseases of rats. Due to the fact that a comprehensive colony health monitoring program is so vital in protecting the validity and reproducibility of experimental research data, it must be devoted an appropriate priority in terms of budget, personnel, and other resources. The policies and practices should be defined in written plans, and agreement with the principles set forth should be secured by the scientific and administrative leadership of the institution, as well as by the veterinary and animal care group. Programs should be designed to monitor individual animal health through the use of direct methods such as close observation and physical examination. A program created to monitor the overall health status of a colony population often utilizes more indirect methods. Routine testing of selected representative animals (even in the absence of any signs of illness or disease) can provide valuable information regarding the viral, parasitic, and bacterial agents that such animals are either currently harboring or have been exposed to in the past. Risk analysis should be done by any institution planning on holding rodents, a process that should involve a discussion of the relative costs and benefits of the various options available for routine health monitoring as well as quarantine isolation and testing.

Extended Survival and Prognostic Factors for Patients With ALK-Rearranged Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer and Brain Metastasis.

PURPOSE We performed a multi-institutional study to identify prognostic factors and determine outcomes for patients with ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastasis. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 90 patients with brain metastases from ALK-rearranged NSCLC were identified from six institutions; 84 of 90 patients received radiotherapy to the brain (stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS] or whole-brain radiotherapy [WBRT]), and 86 of 90 received tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Estimates for overall (OS) and intracranial progression-free survival were determined and clinical prognostic factors were identified by Cox proportional hazards modeling. RESULTS Median OS after development of brain metastases was 49.5 months (95% CI, 29.0 months to not reached), and median intracranial progression-free survival was 11.9 months (95% CI, 10.1 to 18.2 months). Forty-five percent of patients with follow-up had progressive brain metastases at death, and repeated interventions for brain metastases were common. Absence of extracranial metastases, Karnofsky performance score ≥ 90, and no history of TKIs before development of brain metastases were associated with improved survival (P = .003, < .001, and < .001, respectively), whereas a single brain metastasis or initial treatment with SRS versus WBRT were not (P = .633 and .666, respectively). Prognostic factors significant by multivariable analysis were used to describe four patient groups with 2-year OS estimates of 33%, 59%, 76%, and 100%, respectively (P < .001). CONCLUSION Patients with brain metastases from ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated with radiotherapy (SRS and/or WBRT) and TKIs have prolonged survival, suggesting that interventions to control intracranial disease are critical. The refinement of prognosis for this molecular subtype of NSCLC identifies a population of patients likely to benefit from first-line SRS, close CNS observation, and treatment of emergent CNS disease.

Comparison of the immune competence of Turopolje, German Landrace × Turopolje, and German Landrace × Pietrain pigs after PRRSV vaccination.

The competences of the immune systems of the ancient pig breed Turopolje (T×T), German Landrace × Turopolje (L×T) and 'modern' pig breed German Landrace × Pietrain (L×P) were compared in this study. All pigs were immunized with a modified live vaccine against 'Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome' (PRRS) virus (Ingelvac PRRS MLV(®)) to simulate an infection. Antibody production against PRRS MLV was evaluated in serum. Elimination of the viral infectious fragments during the experimental period was monitored in serum, leukocytes and tonsils by RT-qPCR. Furthermore relevant immune marker genes were quantified either on gene expression level using RT-qPCR [toll like receptor (TLR) 7, TLR8, TRAF6, CD163, SIGLEC1, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD19, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin (IL) 1, IL2, IL6, IL12], and on protein level using ELISA [interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-12]. The three breeds showed individual inactivation efficiencies as a reaction to the PRRS MLV vaccination. T×T eliminated the virus in serum within 16 days, followed by L×T (28 days) and L×P (36 days). The antibody titers against PRRS MLV of L×T and L×P were significantly higher compared to T×T (p<0.05). The gene expression data and protein analysis of interleukins revealed that T×T reacted with a type 1 immune response. In contrast, the two other breeds (L×T and L×P) showed a type 2 immune response, which resulted in the higher synthesis of B-cells and an increased concentration of specific anti-PRRS MLV antibodies.

Considerations for STI Clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is responsible for a global pandemic. It is important to balance the need for access to healthcare services, including testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). STI programs must consider how to use limited resources and implement novel approaches to provide continued access to care.

Dietary consumption triggers in interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome patients.

OBJECTIVES : The aim of this study was to survey interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) patients with a Web-based questionnaire to determine which consumables (foods, drinks, supplements/spices, and general food categories) truly exacerbate IC/BPS symptoms. METHODS : The Interstitial Cystitis Association posted a Web link on its Web site offering its members participation in the Web-based questionnaire from April 2009 to February 2010. Members were asked questions on the effect of 344 different foods, drinks, supplements, condiments/spices, and general food categories on urinary frequency, urgency, and/or pelvic pain symptoms. Members were asked to score symptoms related to consumables on a symptom Likert scale of 0 to 5. Questions on ethnicity, education, symptom duration, seasonal allergies, irritable bowel syndrome, and specific diets were included. RESULTS : There were 598 complete responses to the questionnaire, and 95.8% of the participants answered that certain foods and beverages affected their IC/BPS symptoms. Most items had no effect on symptoms. Items that made symptoms worse were citrus fruits, tomatoes, coffee, tea, carbonated and alcoholic beverages, spicy foods, artificial sweeteners, and vitamin C. Only calcium glycerophosphate (Prelief; AK Pharma, Inc, Pleasantville, NJ) and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) had a trend toward improvement in symptoms. CONCLUSIONS : Interstitial cystitis diets do not have to be overly restrictive. It is recommended that patients with IC/BPS avoid citrus fruits, tomatoes, coffee, tea, carbonated and alcoholic beverages, spicy foods, artificial sweeteners, and vitamin C. The use of calcium glycerophosphate and/or sodium bicarbonate before consumption of these trigger consumables may also help reduce sensitivity.

Focus on a 2019-novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)

A new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, was first discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. As of April 7, 2020, the new coronavirus has spread quickly to 184 countries and aroused the attention of the entire world. No targeted drugs have yet been available for intervention and treatment of this virus. The sharing of academic information is crucial to risk assessment and control activities in outbreak countries. In this review, we summarize the epidemiological, genetic and clinical characteristics of the virus as well as laboratory testing and treatments to understand the nature of the virus. We hope this review will be helpful to prevent viral infections in outbreak countries and regions.

Immunology and Medical Microbiology

We are continuously exposed to many pathogens through inhalation, ingestion, and touch. The immune system protects us from the majority of these pathogens as flatworms, bacteria, fungi, and viruses. We have also witnessed tremendous progress in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases; still, they remain a major challenge and are responsible for major cause of death and disability worldwide. The immune system’s memory response and vaccination have resulted in complete eradication of many diseases. Our immune system is very adaptive and consists of a variety of cells and molecules, which play an active role in protecting us. It not only protects us from the outside pathogenic agents but also is also capable of recognizing the body’s own components. It recognizes them as self and does not induce response against them. It is known as self-/non-self-discrimination. Sometimes due to certain defects or other reasons when the immune system is not able to differentiate self, then it mounts an attack on self-components leading to autoimmunity. The importance of the immune system was recognized by early work of Dr. Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur; they recognized the abilities of the immune system, and since then the system was gradually being explored and it laid the foundation of immunology. However, day-by-day microbes are also posing health risks as new strains are continuously being evolved. Many chemotherapeutic agents have been developed to control the spread and infections. However, microbes are also continuously developing the ability of their survival with emergence of new strains and properties. Antibiotic resistance is occurring with all classes of microbes posing a serious clinical problem in managing infections. The diseases like tuberculosis, cholera, and rheumatic fever, which were believed to be eradicated, have ferociously reemerged. The reemergence and new pathogenic agents might be the result of mutations in their genome and changes occurring in the environment. In this chapter, basic concept of the immune system and some of the diseases of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, nervous system, and respiratory system caused by microorganisms are discussed along with sexually transmitted diseases and characterization of pathogens.

A science-based response to COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic behaves like many other viruses spread through respiratory routes. This is generally a mild disease for those aged less than 50 years. A complete and prolonged lockdown will reduce COVID-19 mortality but simultaneously lead to a graver public health, social, and economic disaster. The focus has to be based on the reality that exists in an area.

Can wearing face masks in public affect transmission route and viral load in COVID-19?

The mandatory face mask wearing was implemented in the Czech Republic and Slovakia shortly after the COVID-19 outbreak in Central Europe. So far, the number of COVID-19-associated deaths per 100,000 individuals is far lower in these countries as compared with other neighbouring or close countries. The use of face masks in public may not protect the general public from contracting the virus, however, presumptively decreases the viral load and contributes to a favourable clinical outcome in COVID-19 disease. A certain time is required for antigen-specific T cells and B cells to fully develop. Obligatory face mask wearing in public favours the virus transmission through oral mucosa and/or conjunctival epithelium, which enables the adaptive immune responses to evolve. In the case of inhalation of high loads of SARS-CoV-2, the time for the development of fully protective adaptive immune responses seems to be insufficient. Then, a less specific and more damaging innate immune response prevails.

Strange Bedfellows: Native American Tribes, Big Pharma, and the Legitimacy of Their Alliance.

Lost in the cacophony surrounding the debate about high drug prices is the fundamental principle that pharmaceutical innovation will not occur without the prospect of outsized returns enabled through market exclusivity. Biopharmaceutical patents are currently under siege, subject to challenge both in inter partes review ("IPR") proceedings and in Hatch-Waxman actions. These twin assaults threaten to eliminate the incentives necessary for biotechnological innovation--particularly for discoveries made upstream in the innovation pipeline--thus imperiling the development of new drug therapies. But a fascinating solution has emerged: invoking tribal immunity to shield pharmaceutical patents from IPR before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board ("PTAB"). This serves two critically important objectives: promoting tribal self-sufficiency, and encouraging investment in life-saving and life-improving new drugs. Contractual partnerships between Native American tribes and pharmaceutical companies not only provide the tribes with a steady stream of royalty revenue, but also insulate biopharmaceutical patents from challenge in IPR proceedings through the invocation of long-established principles of tribal sovereign immunity. This Note is the first piece of scholarship to comprehensively analyze, and advocate for, the right to invoke tribal sovereign immunity in IPR proceedings.

Epidemiology of respiratory infections in young children: insights from the new vaccine surveillance network.

BACKGROUND The New Vaccine Surveillance Network, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was established to provide longitudinal data to help measure the impact of vaccines that decrease the burden of acute respiratory illness in children younger than 5 years of age. Currently 140,000 children younger than 5 years of age, nearly 1% of the U.S. population, are under surveillance in 3 urban counties, which include Nashville, TN, Rochester, NY, and Cincinnati, OH. Prospective, active, population-based surveillance of children hospitalized with respiratory symptoms or fever began in 2000, and outpatient surveillance began in 2002 in selected winter months. RESULTS During the first year of surveillance, the admission rate for acute respiratory illness/fever in children younger than 5 years of age in the surveillance areas was 180 per 10,000 children. In 61% of these hospitalizations, a respiratory virus was identified. Respiratory syncytial viruses, influenza viruses and parainfluenza viruses were identified in 30%, and other respiratory viruses were identified in 36%. Approximately one-third of children hospitalized had identified high risk conditions, primarily asthma (24%). About one-half of the children hospitalized were younger than 6 months of age. Polymerase chain reaction doubled the diagnostic yield of culture for respiratory syncytial viruses, influenza and parainfluenza virus combined. Preliminary data on influenza admissions during the 4 years indicated considerable variation in admission rates by season and site. Annually the mean admission rates during the study period were 43 per 10,000 children younger than 6 months of age, 9 per 10,000 children 6-23 months of age and 4 per 10,000 children 24-59 months of age. CONCLUSION These data provide ongoing surveillance of hospitalizations and other medically attended visits for respiratory viral illness in children younger than 5 years of age. Evaluation of influenza vaccine effectiveness, the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in children and the impact of the pediatric influenza vaccination program are in progress.

Developmental Regulation of Angiotensinogen Gene Expression in Sheep

ABSTRACT: It has been suggested that the liver is not the main source of angiotensinogen during fetal life in rats, but that the kidney is an important site of fetal angiotensinogen synthesis. In an effort to determine if this phenomenon is specific to the rat or applicable to other species, we compared the ontogenic changes in hepatic and renal angiotensinogen mRNA expression in fetal (60, 90, 118, and 138 d of gestation, term being 145 d), newborn (7 d postnatal), and adult sheep. Total RNA was extracted, subjected to Northern blotting and hybridized using a full-length rat radiolabeled antisense RNA. Angiotensinogen mRNA sequences were detected in all fetal liver samples and appeared to increase 3-fold from 60 to 138 d gestation and then to decrease after birth. In contrast, angiotensiogen mRNA could not be detected in renal cortical tissue of 118 or 138 d fetuses, or newborn or adult sheep. We conclude that, unlike in the rat, liver angiotensinogen gene expression is detectable during the 2nd trimester of gestation in sheep and is developmentally regulated. Furthermore, in contrast to the fetal rat, angiotensinogen mRNA sequences were undetectable in fetal sheep kidney.

Percutaneous ablation in the kidney.

Percutaneous ablation in the kidney is now performed as a standard therapeutic nephron-sparing option in patients who are poor candidates for resection. Its increasing use has been largely prompted by the rising incidental detection of renal cell carcinomas with cross-sectional imaging and the need to preserve renal function in patients with comorbid conditions, multiple renal cell carcinomas, and/or heritable renal cancer syndromes. Clinical studies to date indicate that radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation are effective therapies with acceptable short- to intermediate-term outcomes and with a low risk in the appropriate setting, with attention to pre-, peri-, and postprocedural detail. The results following percutaneous radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma are reviewed in this article, including those of several larger scale studies of ablation of T1a tumors. Clinical and technical considerations unique to ablation in the kidney are presented, and potential complications are discussed.

Travel-acquired infections and illnesses in Canadians: surveillance report from CanTravNet surveillance data, 2009–2011

BACKGROUND: Important knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of migration medicine practice and the impact of pathogens imported by Canadian travellers. We present here a comprehensive, Canada-specific surveillance summary of illness in a cohort of returned Canadian travellers and new immigrants. METHODS: We extracted and analyzed (using standard parametric and nonparametric techniques) data from the Canadian Travel Medicine Network (CanTravNet) database for ill returned Canadian travellers and new immigrants who presented to a Canadian GeoSentinel Surveillance Network site between September 2009 and September 2011. RESULTS: During the study period, 4365 travellers and immigrants presented to a CanTravNet site, 3943 (90.3%) of whom were assigned a travel-related diagnosis. Among the 3115 non-immigrant travellers with a definitive travel-related diagnosis, arthropod bite (n = 127 [4.1%]), giardiasis (n = 91 [2.9%]), malaria (n = 77 [2.5%]), latent tuberculosis (n = 73 [2.3%]), and strongyloidiasis (n = 66 [2.1%]) were the most common specific etiologic diagnoses. Among the 828 immigrants with definitive travel-related diagnoses, the most frequent etiologies were latent tuberculosis (n = 229 [27.7%]), chronic hepatitis B (n = 182 [22.0%]), active tuberculosis (n = 97 [11.7%]), chronic hepatitis C (n = 89 [10.7%]), and strongyloidiasis (n = 41 [5.0%]). Potentially serious infections, such as dengue fever (61 cases) and enteric fever due to Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi or Paratyphi (36 cases), were common. Individuals travelling for the purpose of visiting friends and relatives (n = 500 [11.6% of those with known reason for travel]) were over-represented among those diagnosed with malaria and enteric fever, compared with other illnesses (for malaria 34/94 [36.2%] v. 466/4221 [11.0%]; for enteric fever, 17/36 [47.2%] v. 483/4279 [11.3%]) (both p < 0.001). For cases of malaria, there was also overrepresentation (compared with other illnesses) from business travellers (22/94 [23.4%] v. 337/4221 [8.0%]) and males (62/94 [66.0%] v. 1964/4269 [46.0%]) (both p < 0.001). Malaria was more likely than other illnesses to be acquired in sub-Saharan Africa (p < 0.001), whereas dengue was more likely than other illnesses to be imported from the Caribbean and South East Asia (both p = 0.003) and enteric fever from South Central Asia (24/36 [66.7%]) (p < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: This analysis of surveillance data on ill returned Canadian travellers has detailed the spectrum of imported illness within this cohort. It provides an epidemiologic framework for Canadian practitioners encountering ill returned travellers. We have confirmed that travel to visit friends and relatives confers particularly high risks, which underscores the need to improve pretravel intervention for a population that is unlikely to seek specific pretravel advice. Potentially serious and fatal illnesses such as malaria and enteric fever were common, as were illnesses of public health importance, such as tuberculosis and hepatitis B.

Efficacy and safety of hepatectomy performed with intermittent portal triad clamping with low central venous pressure.

BACKGROUND This retrospective study was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of intermittent portal triad clamping (PTC) with low central venous pressure (CVP) in liver resections. METHODS Between January 2007 and August 2013, 115 patients underwent liver resection with intermittent PTC. The patients' data were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS There were 58 males and 57 females with a mean age of 55 years (± 13.7). Cirrhosis was found in 23 patients. Resections were performed for malignant disease in 62.6% (n = 72) and for benign disease in 37.4% (n = 43). Major hepatectomy was performed in 26 patients (22.4%). Mean liver ischemia period was 27.1 min (± 13.9). The mortality rate was 1.7% and the morbidity rate was 22.6%. Cumulative clamping time (t = 3.61, P < 0.001) and operation time (t = 2.38, P < 0.019) were significantly correlated with AST alterations (D-AST). Cumulative clamping time (t = 5.16, P < 0.001) was significantly correlated with D-ALT. Operation time (t = 5.81, P < 0.001) was significantly correlated with D-LDH. CONCLUSIONS Intermittent PTC under low CVP was performed with low morbidity and mortality. Intermittent PTC can be safely applied up to 60 minutes in both normal and impaired livers.

Accuracy of near-patient vs. inbuilt spirometry for monitoring tidal volumes in an in-vitro paediatric lung model.

Spirometric monitoring provides precise measurement and delivery of tidal volumes within a narrow range, which is essential for lung-protective strategies that aim to reduce morbidity and mortality in mechanically-ventilated patients. Conventional anaesthesia ventilators include inbuilt spirometry to monitor inspiratory and expiratory tidal volumes. The GE Aisys CS2 anaesthesia ventilator allows additional near-patient spirometry via a sensor interposed between the proximal end of the tracheal tube and the respiratory tubing. Near-patient and inbuilt spirometry of two different GE Aisys CS2 anaesthesia ventilators were compared in an in-vitro study. Assessments were made of accuracy and variability in inspiratory and expiratory tidal volume measurements during ventilation of six simulated paediatric lung models using the ASL 5000 test lung. A total of 9240 breaths were recorded and analysed. Differences between inspiratory tidal volumes measured with near-patient and inbuilt spirometry were most significant in the newborn setting (p < 0.001), and became less significant with increasing age and weight. During expiration, tidal volume measurements with near-patient spirometry were consistently more accurate than with inbuilt spirometry for all lung models (p < 0.001). Overall, the variability in measured tidal volumes decreased with increasing tidal volumes, and was smaller with near-patient than with inbuilt spirometry. The variability in measured tidal volumes was higher during expiration, especially with inbuilt spirometry. In conclusion, the present in-vitro study shows that measurements with near-patient spirometry are more accurate and less variable than with inbuilt spirometry. Differences between measurement methods were most significant in the smallest patients. We therefore recommend near-patient spirometry, especially for neonatal and paediatric patients.

Treatment With Lopinavir/Ritonavir or Interferon-β1b Improves Outcome of MERS-CoV Infection in a Nonhuman Primate Model of Common Marmoset

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe disease in human with an overall case-fatality rate of >35%. Effective antivirals are crucial for improving the clinical outcome of MERS. Although a number of repurposed drugs, convalescent-phase plasma, antiviral peptides, and neutralizing antibodies exhibit anti-MERS-CoV activity in vitro, most are not readily available or have not been evaluated in nonhuman primates. We assessed 3 repurposed drugs with potent in vitro anti-MERS-CoV activity (mycophenolate mofetil [MMF], lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon-β1b) in common marmosets with severe disease resembling MERS in humans. The lopinavir/ritonavir-treated and interferon-β1b-treated animals had better outcome than the untreated animals, with improved clinical (mean clinical scores ↓50.9%–95.0% and ↓weight loss than the untreated animals), radiological (minimal pulmonary infiltrates), and pathological (mild bronchointerstitial pneumonia) findings, and lower mean viral loads in necropsied lung (↓0.59–1.06 log(10) copies/glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH]; P < .050) and extrapulmonary (↓0.11–1.29 log(10) copies/GAPDH; P < .050 in kidney) tissues. In contrast, all MMF-treated animals developed severe and/or fatal disease with higher mean viral loads (↑0.15–0.54 log(10) copies/GAPDH) than the untreated animals. The mortality rate at 36 hours postinoculation was 67% (untreated and MMF-treated) versus 0–33% (lopinavir/ritonavir-treated and interferon-β1b-treated). Lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-β1b alone or in combination should be evaluated in clinical trials. MMF alone may worsen MERS and should not be used.

Coronaviruses widespread on nonliving surfaces: important questions and promising answers

The world is facing, while writing this review, a global pandemic due to one of the types of the coronaviruses (i.e., COVID-19), which is a new virus. Among the most important reasons for the transmission of infection between humans is the presence of this virus active on the surfaces and materials. Here, we addressed important questions such as do coronaviruses remain active on the inanimate surfaces? Do the types of inanimate surfaces affect the activity of coronaviruses? What are the most suitable ingredients that used to inactivate viruses? This review article addressed many of the works that were done in the previous periods on the survival of many viruses from the coronaviruses family on various surfaces such as steel, glass, plastic, Teflon, ceramic tiles, silicon rubber and stainless steel copper alloys, Al surface, sterile sponges, surgical gloves and sterile latex. The impacts of environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity were presented and discussed. The most important active ingredients that can deactivate viruses on the surfaces were reported here. We hope that these active ingredients will have the same effect on COVID-19.

Physical health among people with serious mental illness in the face of COVID-19: Concerns and mitigation strategies

COVID-19 can worsen the physical health of individuals with serious mental illness, a vulnerable group already facing physical health disparities. COVID-19 is further reducing access to physical health care due to shutdown of services deemed "non-urgent" and overcrowding of emergency services. Management of chronic diseases, highly prevalent in this group, is undermined due to exacerbation of psychiatric disorders, reduction in availability of social support, and worsening of negative social determinants of health. In this commentary, we discuss the challenges experienced by this group and offer mitigation strategies to reduce: (1) inequalities in access to physical health care; and (2) disruptions to the management of chronic physical conditions in the face of COVID-19. Recommendations include coordinated efforts by health authorities, primary and mental health care organizations, researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders. These efforts should ensure equitable access to physical health care and implementation of innovative programs to protect the physical health of people with serious mental illness during and following the pandemic.

Insights into pathogenesis of fatal COVID-19 pneumonia from histopathology with immunohistochemical and viral RNA studies

INTRODUCTION: We describe postmortem pulmonary histopathologic findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with a spectrum of disease course, from rapid demise to prolonged hospitalization. METHODS: Histopathologic findings in postmortem lung tissue from eight patients who died from COVID-19 pneumonia were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next generation sequencing (NGS) were performed to detect virus. RESULTS: Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was seen in all cases with a spectrum of acute phase and/or organizing phase. IHC with monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleoprotein and spike protein detected virus in areas of acute but not organizing DAD, with intracellular viral antigen and RNA expression seen predominantly in patients with duration of illness less than 10 days. Major vascular findings included thrombi in medium and large caliber vessels, platelet microthrombi detected by CD61 IHC, and fibrin microthrombi. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA by NGS early in the disease course and expression of viral antigen by IHC exclusively in the acute but not in the organizing phase of DAD, suggests that the virus may play a major role in initiating the acute lung injury of DAD, but when DAD progresses to the organizing phase, the virus may have been cleared from the lung by the patient's immune response. These findings suggest the possibility of a major change during the disease course of COVID-19 pneumonia that may have therapeutic implications. Frequent thrombi and microthrombi may also present potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Pulmonary Infection in a Patient After Stem Cell Transplantation

A 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and acute myelogenous leukemia presented with recurrent fever and cough. He had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched unrelated donor 17 months previously. His posttransplant course was complicated by graft versus host disease and multiple central venous catheter infections with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus. During his initial course, he also developed a nodular pneumonia, and the subsequent workup included a bronchoscopy that was nondiagnostic.

Isolation and molecular characterization of nephropathic infectious bronchitis virus isolates of Gujarat state, India

Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a common, highly contagious, acute, and economically important viral disease of chickens caused by Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, sp. Avian coronavirus). Five pooled tissue suspensions of 50 layer birds and one reference Massachusetts vaccine strain were inoculated into specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken egg for isolation of IBV. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out using post inoculated allontoic fluid to amplify the spike (S) glycoprotein of S1 subunit of IBV. All the eggs inoculated with five pooled tissue samples and vaccine sample showed dwarfing and curling of SPF embryos indicative of IBV. All the five samples and the vaccine sample produced the expected amplicons of 466 bp by RT-PCR. The sequencing of five isolates revealed that all the five sequences were 99.09–100 % similar among themselves and showed 99.10–100 % nucleotide identity with the vaccine strain. On multiple sequence alignment it was found that our isolates were more similar at S1 subunit nucleotide level with the reference Ma5 and H120 vaccine strains than the reference Mass41 strain. The sequences of Anand isolates revealed further genetic changes in the circulating IBV in comparison to previous isolate of Gujarat as well as higher differences with the strains isolated in other states showing substantial changes at genetic level in Indian IBV isolates, which may partially explain the increasing incidences of IB in the country in spite of the vaccination. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13337-015-0248-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

OBJECTIVES: To design a standardized imaging diagnostic reporting mode for screening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to prospectively verify its effectiveness in clinical practice. METHODS: A new classification and standardized imaging diagnosis report mode of viral pneumonia was established by studying and summarizing the imaging findings of various kinds of viral pneumonia, combining with lesion density, interstitial changes, pleural effusion, lymph nodes, and some special signs. After systematic training, the radiologist experienced clinical practice for screening CT features. COVID-19 cases were screened retrospectively in the single-center. The confirmed cases were verified, and the diagnostic efficacy of the standardized imaging reporting system in screening COVID-19 was tested. RESULTS: There were 912 patients in this stage receiving the screening imaging examination. Of them, 190 patients were screened in the report mode and 30 patients were diagnosed as COVID-19. The CT manifestation of COVID-19 was characterized by pure ground glass lesions or with a few solid components, predominant subpleural distribution, no lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion, and often with paving-way sign and air bronchus sign. In combination with the above signs, the diagnostic efficacy of COVID-19 was 0.942. CONCLUSIONS: The standardized imaging diagnosis report mode based on COVID-19 chest image features is effective and practical, which should be popularized.

Early institutional head and neck oncologic and microvascular surgery practice patterns across the United States during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID19) pandemic

BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused rapid changes in head and neck cancer (HNC) care. "Real-time" methods to monitor practice patterns can optimize provider safety and patient care. METHODS: Head and neck surgeons from 14 institutions in the United States regularly contributed their practice patterns to a shared spreadsheet. Data from 27 March 2020 to 5 April 2020 was analyzed. RESULTS: All institutions had significantly restricted HNC clinic evaluations. Two institutions stopped free-flap surgery with the remaining scheduling surgery by committee review. Factors contributing to reduced clinical volume included lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) (35%) and lack of rapid COVID-19 testing (86%). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a reduction in HNC care. Rapid COVID-19 testing and correlation with infectious potential remain paramount to resuming the care of patients with head and neck cancer. Cloud-based platforms to share practice patterns will be essential as the pandemic evolves.

Infection with porcine respiratory coronavirus does not fully protect pigs against intestinal transmissible gastroenteritis virus.

Eight nine-week-old specific-pathogen-free pigs which had been infected with the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)-related porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and four uninfected littermates were challenged with TGEV. The previous PRCV infection failed to protect them against the enteric TGEV infection. Virus excretion in faeces was detected by an ELISA in all the pigs for three to six consecutive days after inoculation. Although little diarrhoea was observed, the infection extended through much of the small intestine of one of the previously infected pigs four days after inoculation. Challenge with TGEV caused a secondary neutralising antibody response. By using a peroxidase conjugate of a monoclonal antibody which recognises a specific antigenic site on TGEV, antibodies against TGEV could be distinguished from antibodies against PRCV in an ELISA blocking test.

The impact of COVID-19 and strategies for mitigation and suppression in low- and middle-income countries

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses a severe threat to public health worldwide. We combine data on demography, contact patterns, disease severity, and health care capacity and quality to understand its impact and inform strategies for its control. Younger populations in lower income countries may reduce overall risk but limited health system capacity coupled with closer inter-generational contact largely negates this benefit. Mitigation strategies that slow but do not interrupt transmission will still lead to COVID-19 epidemics rapidly overwhelming health systems, with substantial excess deaths in lower income countries due to the poorer health care available. Of countries that have undertaken suppression to date, lower income countries have acted earlier. However, this will need to be maintained or triggered more frequently in these settings to keep below available health capacity, with associated detrimental consequences for the wider health, well-being and economies of these countries.

Single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging of the early time course of therapy-induced cell death using technetium 99m tricarbonyl His-annexin A5 in a colorectal cancer xenograft model.

As apoptosis occurs over an interval of time after administration of apoptosis-inducing therapy in tumors, the changes in technetium 99m ((99m)Tc)-tricarbonyl (CO)₃ His-annexin A5 (His-ann A5) accumulation over time were examined. Colo205-bearing mice were divided into six treatment groups: (1) control, (2) 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 250 mg/kg), (3) irinotecan (100 mg/kg), (4) oxaliplatin (30 mg/kg), (5) bevacizumab (5 mg/kg), and (6) panitumumab (6 mg/kg). (99m)Tc-(CO)₃ His-ann A5 was injected 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours posttreatment, and micro-single-photon emission computed tomography was performed. Immunostaining of caspase-3 (apoptosis), survivin (antiapoptosis), and LC3-II (autophagy marker) was also performed. Different dynamics of (99m)Tc-(CO)₃ His-ann A5 uptake were observed in this colorectal cancer xenograft model, in response to a single dose of three different chemotherapeutics (5-FU, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin). Bevacizumab-treated mice showed no increased uptake of the radiotracer, and a peak of (99m)Tc-(CO)₃ His-ann A5 uptake in panitumumab-treated mice was observed 24 hours posttreatment, as confirmed by caspase-3 immunostaining. For irinotecan-, oxaliplatin-, and bevacizumab-treated tumors, a significant correlation was established between the radiotracer uptake and caspase-3 immunostaining (r = .8, p < .05; r = .9, p < .001; r = .9, p < .001, respectively). For 5-FU- and panitumumab-treated mice, the correlation coefficients were r = .7 (p = .18) and r = .7 (p = .19), respectively. Optimal timing of annexin A5 imaging after the start of different treatments in the Colo205 model was determined.

Development of CRISPR as a prophylactic strategy to combat novel coronavirus and influenza

The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected more than 100,000 people worldwide with over 3,000 deaths since December 2019. There is no cure for COVID-19 and the vaccine development is estimated to require 12-18 months. Here we demonstrate a CRISPR-Cas13-based strategy, PAC-MAN (Prophylactic Antiviral CRISPR in huMAN cells), for viral inhibition that can effectively degrade SARS-CoV-2 sequences and live influenza A virus (IAV) genome in human lung epithelial cells. We designed and screened a group of CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) targeting conserved viral regions and identified functional crRNAs for cleaving SARS-CoV-2. The approach is effective in reducing respiratory cell viral replication for H1N1 IAV. Our bioinformatic analysis showed a group of only six crRNAs can target more than 90% of all coronaviruses. The PAC-MAN approach is potentially a rapidly implementable pan-coronavirus strategy to deal with emerging pandemic strains.

IJED support for eating disorders research in the time of COVID‐19

This editorial reports on an anonymous survey question posed to eating disorders researchers about changes the International Journal of Eating Disorders (IJED) should implement to support the eating disorders research community affected by COVID‐19. The editorial accompanies an IJED article that details responses to the larger survey focusing more broadly on COVID‐19‐related research disruptions. Survey invitations were sent to editorial board members of eating disorders journals, members of eating disorder scientific organizations (e.g., Eating Disorders Research Society), and individuals who provided at least three IJED reviews in the prior 12 months. We reviewed the responses of 187 participants and identified three categories of changes that: (a) had already been implemented by the journal, (b) cannot be implemented because they fall outside the scope of IJED, or (c) will be implemented in coming weeks or months. The latter category includes publishing topical COVID‐19 papers, making some COVID‐19‐related content available open access, revising statistical guidelines, and issuing author guidance on reporting protocol changes caused by COVID‐19‐related disruptions. IJED recognizes the disruptive impacts that COVID‐19 has on all activities in our field, including clinical work, teaching, and advocacy, and is committed to supporting authors during this difficult time while striving to publish high‐quality research.

COVID-19 and Digital Resilience: Evidence from Uber Eats

We analyze how digital platforms can increase the survival rate of firms during a crisis by providing continuity in access to customers. Using order-level data from Uber Technologies, we study how the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing shutdown of businesses in the United States affected independent, small business restaurant supply and demand on the Uber Eats platform. We find evidence that small restaurants experience significant increases in total activity, orders per day, and orders per hour following the closure of the dine-in channel, and that these increases may be due to both demand-side and supply-side shocks. We document an increase in the intensity of competitive effects following the shock, showing that growth in the number of providers on a platform induces both market expansion and heightened inter-provider competition. Our findings underscore the critical role that digital will play in creating business resilience in the post-COVID economy, and provide new managerial insight into how supply-side and demand-side factors shape business performance on a platform.

Tracing Data Journeys Through Medical Case Reports: Conceptualizing Case Reports Not as “Anecdotes” but Productive Epistemic Constructs, or Why Zebras Can Be Useful

Medical case reports provide an important example of data journeying: they are used to collect data and make them available for re-use to others in the field including clinicians, biomedical researchers, and health policymakers. In this paper, I explore how data journey in case reports, with particular focus on the earliest stages of the process, namely from creation and publication of case reports to the initial re-uses of them and data within them. I investigate key themes relating to case reporting and re-use, including factors which seem to smooth the path along which the data captured by a case report journey via broader citation patterns and detailed qualitative analysis of highly re-used case reports. This analysis reveals some of the key factors associated with the case reports whose data have greater amounts of journeying including publication in a general medical journal; that the data have broader implications and evidential value for topical or even urgent issues for instance in public health; and use in the case report of multiple research methods or concepts from diverse subfields. These findings along with standardization of case reporting are shown to have epistemological implications, particularly for how we understand the journeying of data.

Internal retraction in single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy: initial experience and learning curve.

INTRODUCTION We report our experience and learning curve in single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SPLC) using an internal anchored retraction system. METHODS Usefulness of the retraction system was analysed in 18 SPLC. The first eight, the following ten SPLC and 20 consecutive four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomies (4PLC) were compared. Duration of operation, burns on nontarget tissue and gallbladder perforations were assessed by reviewing videotapes recorded during the procedures. RESULTS Use of the retraction system failed in three out of five patients (60%) with intraoperative signs of chronic inflammation and in one out of 13 (7.1%) without such signs (p = 0.0441). Median operation time was 90 (45-120) in the first eight and 55 (40-180) minutes in the following ten SPLC (p = 0.0361). Whereas the first eight SPLC lasted longer compared to 4PLC (70 (40-140) minutes, p = 0.0435) the difference disappeared after eight procedures (p = 0.2076). Median number of burns to nontarget tissue was seven (1-16) in the first eight and one (0-8) in the following ten SPLC (p = 0.0049). There was no difference in perforation of the gallbladder. DISCUSSION Internal retraction enables a safe exposure of the Calot triangle avoiding bile spillage in cholecystectomies without intraoperative signs of inflammation. Familiarisation with SPLC was rapidly achieved. Operation time and dexterity were equal to 4PLC after eight SPLC.

Quantifying the improvement in confirmation efficiency of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the early phase of the outbreak in Hong Kong in 2020

BACKGROUNDS: The emerging virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused a large outbreak of coronavirus disease, COVID-19, in Wuhan, China, since December 2019. COVID-19 soon spread to other regions of China and overseas. In Hong Kong, local mitigation measures were implemented since the first imported case was confirmed on January 23, 2020. Here we evaluated the temporal variation of detection delay from symptoms onset to laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong. METHODS: A regression model is adopted to quantify the association between the SARS-CoV-2 detection delay and calendar time. The association is tested and further validated by a Cox proportional hazard model. FINDINGS: The estimated median detection delay was 9.5 days (95%CI: 6.5-11.5) in the second half of January, reduced to 6.0 days (95%CI: 5.5-9.5) in the first half of February 2020. We estimate that SARS-CoV-2 detection efficiency improved at a daily rate of 5.40% (95%CI: 2.54-8.33) in Hong Kong. CONCLUSIONS: The detection efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 was likely being improved substantially in Hong Kong since the first imported case was detected. Sustaining enforcement in timely detection and other effective control measures are recommended to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Active fractions of mannoproteins derived from yeast cell wall stimulate innate and acquired immunity of adult and elderly dogs

Abstract Nutritional intervention in older dogs aims to increase lifespan and improve life quality as well as delay the development of diseases related to ageing. It is believed that active fractions of mannoproteins (AFMs) obtained through extraction and fractionation of yeast cell walls (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) may beneficially modulate the immune system. However, studies that have evaluated this component and the effects of ageing on the immune system of dogs are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the immunological effects of AFMs in adult and elderly dogs. Three extruded iso-nutrient experimental diets were formulated: without addition of AFM (T0); with AFM at 400 mg/kg (T400); and with AFM at 800 mg/kg (T800). Thirty-six beagle dogs were used, and six experimental treatments, resulting in combinations of age (adult and elderly) and diet (T0, T400, and T800), were evaluated. On days zero, 14, and 28, blood samples were obtained for leucocyte phenotyping and phagocytosis assays. On days zero and 28, a lymphoproliferation test, quantification of reactive oxygen (H2O2) and nitrogen (NO) intermediate production, evaluation of faecal immunoglobulin A (IgA) content, and a delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity test (DCHT) were performed. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software. Repeated measure variance analyses were performed, and means were compared by the Tukey test. Values of P ≤ 0.05 were considered significant, and values of P ≤ 0.10 were considered tendencies. Dogs fed T400 tended to have higher neutrophilic phagocytic activity than dogs fed T800 (P = 0.073). Regarding reactive oxygen intermediates, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated neutrophils from animals that were fed T400 had a tendency to produce more H2O2 than those from animals fed the control diet (P = 0.093). Elderly dogs, when compared to adult dogs, had lower absolute T and B lymphocyte counts, lower auxiliary T lymphocyte counts, and higher cytotoxic T lymphocyte counts (P < 0.05). A significant effect of diet, age, and time with saline inoculation was noted for the DCHT. There was no effect of diet or age on faecal IgA content in dogs. This study suggests beneficial effects of mannoproteins on the specific and nonspecific immune responses in adult and elderly dogs.

Engineered immunogen binding to alum adjuvant enhances humoral immunity

Adjuvants are central to the efficacy of subunit vaccines. Aluminum hydroxide (alum) is the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant, yet its adjuvanticity is often weak and mechanisms of triggering antibody responses remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that site-specific modification of immunogens with short peptides composed of repeating phosphoserine (pSer) residues enhances binding to alum and prolongs immunogen bioavailability. The pSer-modified immunogens formulated in alum elicited greatly increased germinal center, antibody, neutralizing antibody, memory and long-lived plasma cell responses compared to conventional alum-adsorbed immunogens. Mechanistically, pSer-immunogen:alum complexes form nanoparticles that traffic to lymph nodes and trigger B cell activation through multivalent and oriented antigen display. Direct uptake of antigen-decorated alum particles by B cells upregulated antigen processing and presentation pathways, further enhancing B cell activation. These data provide insights into mechanisms of action of alum and introduce a readily translatable approach to significantly improve humoral immunity to subunit vaccines using a clinical adjuvant.

Anesthetic Considerations During Heart Transplantation using Donation after Circulatory Death

Worldwide, the majority of heart transplant organs are from donation after brain death (DBD). However, the shortage of suitable donors places severe limitations on this route. One option to increase the donor pool is to use organs from donation after circulatory death (DCD). Transplant centers for solid organs have been using DCD organs for years. At this time, 40% of solid organ transplantation in the UK use organs from DCD. Use of DCD for solid organ transplants in Canada is also rising. Recently, there has been interest in using DCD organs for heart transplantation. We will discuss our experience of 4 heart transplants with organs from DCD donors after normothermic regional perfusion (NRP). Our first heart transplant using a DCD organ was in January 2020, and the fourth was in March 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic. Our protocol using NRP allows us to evaluate the donor heart adequately to confidently determine organ acceptance. The co-location of the donor and the recipient in neighboring ORs limits ischemic times. Avoidance of an expensive ex-vivo organ perfusion machine is an additional benefit for programs that may not have the resources required to purchase and maintain the machine. Some hospitals may not have the resources and space to be able to co-locate both the donor and recipient. Use of cold storage may be an option to transport the procured organ, similar to DBD organs. We hope that this technique of NRP in DCD donors can help further increase the donor pool for heart transplantation in the US.

Structural basis of RNA recognition by the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is currently negatively affecting the population and disrupting the global economy. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the +RNA virus family that utilize single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecules as genomes. SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, has an unusually large genome for a +RNA virus that encodes four structural proteins – the matrix (M), small envelope (E), spike (S) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) - and sixteen nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) that together ensure replication of the virus in the host cell. The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N is essential for linking the viral genome to the viral membrane. Its N-terminal RNA binding domain (N-NTD) captures the RNA genome while the C-terminal domain anchors the ribonucleoprotein complex to the viral membrane via its interaction with the M protein. Here, we characterized the structure of the N-NTD and its interaction with RNA using NMR spectroscopy. We observed a positively charged canyon on the surface of the N-NTD lined with arginine residues suggesting a putative RNA binding site. Next, we performed an NMR titration experiment using an RNA duplex. The observed changes in positions of signals in the N-NTD NMR spectra allowed us to construct a model of the N-NTD in complex with RNA.

Vapor H2O2 sterilization as a decontamination method for the reuse of N95 respirators in the COVID-19 emergency

There are a variety of methods routinely used in the sterilization of medical devices using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) including vaporization, plasma generation and ionization. Many of these systems are used for sterilization and are validated for bioburden reduction using bacterial spores. Here, we explored the benefits of using vaporized H2O2 (VHP) treatment of N95 respirators for emergency decontamination and reuse to alleviate PPE shortages for healthcare workers in the COVID-19 emergency. The factors that are considered for the effective reuse of these respirators are the fit, the filter efficiency and the decontamination/disinfection level for SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative virus for COVID-19 and other organisms of concern in the hospital environment such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Clostridium difficile. WE showed that the method did not affect fit or filter efficiency at least for one cycle and resulted in a >6 log reduction in bacterial spores and >3.8 log reduction in the infectious SARS-CoV2 load on N95 respirators.

Antibody-Validated Proteins in Inflamed Islets of Fulminant Type 1 Diabetes Profiled by Laser-Capture Microdissection Followed by Mass Spectrometry

BACKGROUND: There are no reports of proteomic analyses of inflamed islets in type 1 diabetes. PROCEDURES: Proteins expressed in the islets of enterovirus-associated fulminant type 1 diabetes (FT1DM) with extensive insulitis were identified by laser-capture microdissection mass spectrometry using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pancreatic tissues. RESULTS: Thirty-eight proteins were identified solely in FT1DM islets, most of which have not been previously linked to type 1 diabetes. Five protein-protein interacting clusters were identified, and the cellular localization of selected proteins was validated immunohistochemically. Migratory activity-related proteins, including plastin-2 (LCP1), moesin (MSN), lamin-B1 (LMNB1), Ras GTPase-activating-like protein (IQGAP1) and others, were identified in CD8(+) T cells and CD68(+) macrophages infiltrated to inflamed FT1DM islets. Proteins involved in successive signaling in innate/adaptive immunity were identified, including SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), Ras GTPase-activating-like protein (IQGAP1), proteasome activator complex subunit 1 (PSME1), HLA class I histocompatibility antigen (HLA-C), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1-alpha/beta (STAT1). Angiogenic (thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP)) and anti-angiogenic (tryptophan-tRNA ligase (WARS)) factors were identified in migrating CD8(+) T cells and CD68(+) macrophages. Proteins related to virus replication and cell proliferation, including probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DEAD box helicase 5 (DDX5) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (HNRNPH1), were identified. The anti-apoptotic protein T-complex protein 1 subunit epsilon (CCT5), the anti-oxidative enzyme 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PDG), and the anti-viral and anti-apoptotic proteins serpin B6 (SERPINB6) and heat shock 70 kDa protein1-like (HSPA1L), were identified in FT1DM-affected islet cells. CONCLUSION: The identified FT1DM-characterizing proteins include those involved in aggressive beta cell destruction through massive immune cell migration and proteins involved in angiogenesis and islet vasculature bleeding, cell repair, and anti-inflammatory processes. Several target proteins for future type 1 diabetes interventions were identified.

Research on Crowd-Sensing Task Assignment Based on Fuzzy Inference PSO Algorithm

To solve the problem of load unbalance in the case of few users and multi-task, a fuzzy inference PSO algorithm (FPSO) crowd sensing single objective task assignment method is proposed. With task completion time, user load balancing and perceived cost as the optimization goals, the fuzzy learning algorithm dynamically adjusts the learning factor in the PSO algorithm, so that the PSO algorithm can perform global search in the scope of the task space, thus obtaining the optimal task assignment solution set. Finally, the FPSO algorithm is compared with the PSO, GA and ABC algorithms on the optimization objectives, such as the algorithm convergence, task completion time, perceived cost and load balance. The experimental results show that the FPSO algorithm not only has faster convergence rate than the other algorithms, and shorten the task completion time, reduce the platform’s perceived cost, improve the user’s load balance, and have a good application effect in the crowd sensing task assignment.

Enteric virus contamination of foods through industrial practices: a primer on intervention strategies

Hepatitis A and E viruses, rotaviruses, Norwalk-like caliciviruses, and astroviruses are among the enteric viruses known to cause food- and waterborne illness. These viruses are spread by the fecal–oral route and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Foods may be contaminated at any time pre- or post-harvest; however, many outbreaks are associated with foods handled by infected restaurant workers. Produce may be contaminated by improper irrigation or fertilization practices, by the hands of infected pickers or processors, or as the result of adulteration during any stage of handling. Outbreaks have been commonly associated with foods which are served raw or only lightly cooked, such as molluscan shellfish, fruits and vegetables, and salads or products contaminated after cooking like frosted bakery products. The farming, shellfish, processing, transportation, and restaurant industries must maintain vigilance to reduce outbreaks of enteric virus illness. Intervention strategies to enhance product safety include increased industry and consumer education; changes in industrial practices, product management, and processing technologies; worker immunizations; and the development of improved monitoring tools for the detection of enteric viruses in foods. Journal of Industrial Microbiology & Biotechnology (2001) 27, 117–125.

What older adults do with the results of dementia screening programs.

INTRODUCTION Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are often under-recognized in the community. MCI/ADRD screening could offer benefits such as early treatment, research participation, lifestyle modification, and advanced care planning. To date, there are no clear guidelines regarding the benefits vs. harms of dementia screening or whether a dementia screening program could be successful. METHODS A community-based study was conducted to evaluate an MCI/ADRD screening program and determine what older adults would do with the information. Measures of cognition, physical health, functionality, and mood were collected. Participants met with a health professional, were given screening results with recommendations, and then contacted 60 days later to determine what was done with the results. Logistic regression models were used to build predictive models. RESULTS Participants (n = 288) had a mean age of 71.5±8.3y, mean education of 13.3±4.8y, and were 70% female, 67% White, 26% African American, and 48% Hispanic. After 60 days, 75% of participants were re-contacted; 54% shared results with family, 33% shared results with health care providers (HCPs), and 52% initiated behavioral change. Among participants sharing results with HCPs, 51% reported HCPs did not follow-up on the results, and 18% that HCPs did not show any interest in the screening visit or its results. Predictors of sharing results with HCPs were elevated hemoglobin A1C (OR = 1.85;95%CI:1.19-2.88), uncontrolled hypertension (OR = 2.73;95%CI:1.09-6.83), and mobility issues (OR = 2.43;95%CI: 1.93-5.54). Participant behavioral changes included lifestyle modification (58%), social engagement (10%), cognitive stimulation (5%), and advanced care planning (4%). The most significant predictors of sharing with family were better overall mental health (OR = 0.19; 95%CI: 0.06-0.59) and better physical function (OR = 0.38; 95%CI: 0.17-0.81). DISCUSSION MCI/ADRD screening was well-received by a diverse community sample. Participants showed interest in sharing the results with their family and HCPs and many attempted behavioral change. While HCPs did not always act on screening results, 25% ordered further testing and evaluation. Efforts need to be directed toward (1) increasing self-efficacy of older adults to discuss screening results with their HCPs, and (2) educating HCPs on the value of early detection of MCI/ADRD. Community dementia screening programs can increase MCI/ADRD detection and improve patient-centered outcomes and medical decision-making.

The Epidemiology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in a Pediatric Healthcare Network in the United States

BACKGROUND: Understanding the prevalence and clinical presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 in pediatric patients can help healthcare providers and systems prepare and respond to this emerging pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective case series of patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) across a pediatric healthcare network, including clinical features and outcomes of those with positive test results. RESULTS: Of 7256 unique children tested for SARS-CoV-2, 424 (5.8%) tested positive. Patients aged 18–21 years had the highest test positive rate (11.2%), while those aged 1–5 years had the lowest (3.9%). By race, 10.6% (226/2132) of black children tested positive vs 3.3% (117/3592) of white children. By indication for testing, 21.1% (371/1756) of patients with reported exposures or clinical symptoms tested positive vs 3.8% (53/1410) of those undergoing preprocedural or preadmission testing. Of 424 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 182 (42.9%) had no comorbidities, 87 (20.5%) had asthma, and 55 (13.0%) were obese. Overall, 52.1% had cough, 51.2% fever, and 14.6% shortness of breath. Seventy-seven (18.2%) SARS-CoV-2–positive patients were hospitalized, of whom 24 (31.2%) required respiratory support. SARS-CoV-2-targeted antiviral therapy was given to 9 patients, and immunomodulatory therapy to 18 patients. Twelve (2.8%) SARS-CoV-2-positive patients required mechanical ventilation, and 2 patients required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Two patients died. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of pediatric patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, the rate of infection was low but varied by testing indication. The majority of cases were mild and few children had critical illness.

Subarachnoid haemorrhage secondary to traumatic intracranial aneurysm of the posterior cerebral circulation: case series and literature review.

BACKGROUND To identify the clinical features, rebleed risk, timing and method of diagnosis, complications and outcome for subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) from traumatic intracranial aneurysm (TICA) of the posterior circulation. Subjects included 26 patients aged 3-54 (mean 24.8). METHODS Case series and literature search to identify all reported cases. RESULTS In our series, two of three cases were fatal as a result of rebleed, and one case had a good outcome with no deficit, following prompt diagnosis and embolisation. Our key findings from the literature review were: 30.7 % of patients were age 16 and under; 88 % had an acute drop in consciousness, 46 % in a delayed manner; the mean time to diagnosis was 7.5 days; initial cerebrovascular imaging was normal in 23 %; the rebleed rate was 23 %; 61 % required emergency diversion of cerebrospinal fluid; 11 % developed vasospasm requiring treatment; 19.2 % had deficits that rendered them unable to live independently. The mortality rate was 27 %. CONCLUSIONS SAH from ruptured posterior circulation TICA is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A high index of suspicion as well as prompt diagnosis, repeat imaging in selected cases, and treatment of any associated TICA can be crucial to a favourable outcome.

Assessing the Impact of Reduced Travel on Exportation Dynamics of Novel Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19)

The impact of the drastic reduction in travel volume within mainland China in January and February 2020 was quantified with respect to reports of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections outside China. Data on confirmed cases diagnosed outside China were analyzed using statistical models to estimate the impact of travel reduction on three epidemiological outcome measures: (i) the number of exported cases, (ii) the probability of a major epidemic, and (iii) the time delay to a major epidemic. From 28 January to 7 February 2020, we estimated that 226 exported cases (95% confidence interval: 86,449) were prevented, corresponding to a 70.4% reduction in incidence compared to the counterfactual scenario. The reduced probability of a major epidemic ranged from 7% to 20% in Japan, which resulted in a median time delay to a major epidemic of two days. Depending on the scenario, the estimated delay may be less than one day. As the delay is small, the decision to control travel volume through restrictions on freedom of movement should be balanced between the resulting estimated epidemiological impact and predicted economic fallout.

The emerging landscape of circular RNAs in immunity: breakthroughs and challenges

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently linked RNAs that exhibit individual strand with a closed-loop framework compared with a conserving, steady and abundant linear counterpart. In recent years, as high-throughput sequencing advancement has been developing, functional circRNAs have been increasingly recognized, and more extensive analyses expounded their effect on different diseases. However, the study on the function of circRNAs in the immune system remains insufficient. This study discusses the basic principles of circRNAs regulation and the systems involved in physiology-related and pathology-related processes. The effect of circRNAs on immune regulation is elucidated. The ongoing development of circRNAs and basic immunology has multiplied their potential in treating diseases. Such perspective will summarize the status and effect of circRNAs on various immune cells in cancer, autoimmune diseases and infections. Moreover, this study will primarily expound the system of circRNAs in T lymphocytes, macrophages and other immune cells, which creates a novel perspective and lay a theoretical basis for treating diseases.

Refinement of long-term toxicity and carcinogenesis studies()

The chance that alternatives will completely replace animals for toxicology research in the foreseeable future is nil. Continual refinement of animal toxicity and carcinogenesis studies, however, can be an effective means of reducing the numbers of animals used and conserving time and resources without compromising scientific quality. We must continue to strive to find species and strains that can metabolize chemicals similar to humans, are small enough to be housed in large numbers, and have low prevalence of spontaneous lesions with sufficient life span to express the toxic and carcinogenic potential of chemicals. Adequate care of animals with control of variables such as light, temperature, diet, bedding, diseases, and genetic characters of laboratory animals will decrease the variability. Humane considerations and euthanasia of animals with large masses and other conditions interfering with eating and drinking, major injuries and ulcers related to husbandry and treatment, and diseases indicating pain and suffering will help not only to alleviate further pain and distress but also to facilitate collection of tissues without secondary complications for detection of chemical treatment-related lesions. Limiting the duration of studies to decrease the variability due to ageassociated changes will also refine long-term studies. Other considerations for refinement of carcinogenesis studies include selection of the most sensitive sex of one or more species for evaluation of selected chemicals in a class where toxic and carcinogenic potential of other representative chemicals are known. Genetically engineered animal models with known oncogenes may reduce the duration and increase the sensitivity of carcinogenesis studies with a reduction in the use of animals.

Population proteomics: addressing protein diversity in humans.

In the past several years, proteomics and its subdiscipline clinical proteomics have been engaged in the discovery of the next generation protein of biomarkers. As the effort and the intensive debate it has sparked continue, it is becoming apparent that a paradigm shift is needed in proteomics in order to truly comprehend the complexity of the human proteome and assess its subtle variations among individuals. This review introduces the concept of population proteomics as a future direction in proteomics research. Population proteomics is the study of protein diversity in human populations. High-throughput, top-down mass spectrometric approaches are employed to investigate, define and understand protein diversity and modulations across and within populations. Population proteomics is a discovery-oriented endeavor with a goal of establishing the incidence of protein structural variations and quantitative regulation of these modifications. Assessing human protein variations among and within populations is viewed as a paramount undertaking that can facilitate clinical proteomics' effort in discovery and validation of protein features that can be used as markers for early diagnosis of disease, monitoring of disease progression and assessment of therapy. This review outlines the growing need for analyzing individuals' proteomes and describes the approaches that are likely to be applied in such a population proteomics endeavor.

Aetiological agents for pulmonary exacerbations in children with cystic fibrosis: An observational study from a tertiary care centre in northern India

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). The infection occurs with a unique spectrum of bacterial pathogens that are usually acquired in an age-dependent fashion. The objective of this study was to find out the aetiological agents in respiratory specimens from children with CF during pulmonary exacerbation and relate with demographic variables. METHODS: In this observational study, airway secretions from children (n=104) with CF presenting with pulmonary exacerbations were collected and tested for bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria and viral pathogens using appropriate laboratory techniques. The frequencies of isolation of various organisms were calculated and associated with various demographic profiles. RESULTS: Bacteria were isolated in 37 (35.5%) and viral RNA in 27 (29.3%) children. Pseudomonas was the most common bacteria grown in 31 (29.8%) followed by Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) in three (2.8%) patients. Among viruses, Rhinovirus was the most common, identified in 16 (17.4%) samples followed by coronavirus in four (4.3%). Fungi and mycobacteria were isolated from 23 (22.1%) and four (3.8%) children, respectively. Aspergillus flavus was the most common fungus isolated in 13 (12.5%) children. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Pseudomonas was the most common organism isolated during exacerbation. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria were not isolated, whereas infection with Bcc and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was observed, which could probably have a role in CF morbidity. Polymicrobial infections were associated with severe exacerbations.

Potential of live pathogen vaccines for defeating the COVID-19 pandemic: History and mechanism

The whole world has entered a terrible crisis with a huge and increasing number of human deaths and economic losses in fighting the pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus termed SARS-CoV-2. The live pathogen vaccine (LPV) strategy, which originated in ancient China for fighting smallpox, has been applied successfully by US military recruits for decades to control acute respiratory diseases caused by types 4 and 7 adenoviruses. This strategy has also been widely employed in veterinary medicine. These facts suggest a fast way out of the current pandemic crisis, namely that SARS-CoV-2 could be directly used as a live vaccine. Beyond the two traditional mechanisms to guarantee the LPV's safety (the LPV seed strain is properly selected; the LPV is inoculated bypassing the respiratory sites of pathology), three novel mechanisms to further ensure the LPV's safety are available (the virus replication is inhibited with early use of an antiviral drug; symptomatic LPV recipients are cured with convalescent plasma; the LPV is inoculated in the hot season). This LPV strategy has multiple potential advantages over other options and could reduce morbidity and mortality greatly as well as the economic loss caused by the pandemic. The safety and efficacy of this strategy should be investigated strictly using animal experiments and clinical trials, and even if the experiments and trials all support the strategy, it should be implemented with enough caution.

Epidemiology of Coronavirus COVID-19: Forecasting the Future Incidence in Different Countries

This paper forecasts the future spread of COVID-19 by exploiting the identified lead-lag effects between different countries. Specifically, we first determine the past relation among nations with the aid of dynamic time warping. This procedure allows an elastic adjustment of the time axis to find similar but phase-shifted sequences. Afterwards, the established framework utilizes information about the leading country to predict the Coronavirus spread of the following nation. The presented methodology is applied to confirmed Coronavirus cases from 1 January 2020 to 28 March 2020. Our results show that China leads all other countries in the range of 29 days for South Korea and 44 days for the United States. Finally, we predict a future collapse of the healthcare systems of the United Kingdom and Switzerland in case of our explosion scenario.

Machine learning to assist clinical decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic

BACKGROUND: The number of cases from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has overwhelmed existing medical facilities and forced clinicians, patients, and families to make pivotal decisions with limited time and information. MAIN BODY: While machine learning (ML) methods have been previously used to augment clinical decisions, there is now a demand for “Emergency ML.” Throughout the patient care pathway, there are opportunities for ML-supported decisions based on collected vitals, laboratory results, medication orders, and comorbidities. With rapidly growing datasets, there also remain important considerations when developing and validating ML models. CONCLUSION: This perspective highlights the utility of evidence-based prediction tools in a number of clinical settings, and how similar models can be deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic to guide hospital frontlines and healthcare administrators to make informed decisions about patient care and managing hospital volume.

Rapid Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Greater New York Metropolitan Area: Geolocation, Demographics, Positivity Rates, and Hospitalization for 46,793 Persons Tested by Northwell Health

BACKGROUND: In March 2020, the greater New York metropolitan area became an epicenter for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The initial evolution of case incidence has not been well characterized. METHODS: Northwell Health Laboratories tested 46,793 persons for SARS-CoV-2 from March 4 through April 10. The primary outcome measure was a positive reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2. The secondary outcomes included patient age, sex, and race if stated; dates the specimen was obtained and the test result; clinical practice site sources; geo-location of patient residence; and hospitalization. RESULTS: From March 8 through April 10, a total of 26,735 of 46,793 persons (57.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Males of each race were disproportionally more affected than females above age 25, with a progressive male predominance as age increased. Of the positive persons, 7,292 were hospitalized directly upon presentation; an additional 882 persons tested positive in an ambulatory setting before subsequent hospitalization, a median of 4.8 days later. Total hospitalization rate was thus 8,174 persons (30.6% of positive persons). There was a broad range (greater than 10-fold) in the cumulative number of positive cases across individual zip codes following documented first case incidents. Test positivity was greater for persons living in zip codes with lower annual household income. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal that SARS-CoV-2 incidence emerged rapidly and almost simultaneously across a broad demographic population in the region. These findings support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection was widely distributed prior to virus testing availability.

Blocking the PI3K/AKT pathway enhances mammalian reovirus replication by repressing IFN-stimulated genes

Many host cellular signaling pathways were activated and exploited by virus infection for more efficient replication. The PI3K/Akt pathway has recently attracted considerable interest due to its role in regulating virus replication. This study demonstrated for the first time that the mammalian reovirus strains Masked Palm Civet/China/2004 (MPC/04) and Bat/China/2003 (B/03) can induce transient activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway early in infection in vitro. When UV-treated, both viruses activated PI3K/Akt signaling, indicating that the virus/receptor interaction was sufficient to activate PI3K/Akt. Reovirus virions can use both clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, but only chlorpromazine, a specific inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, or siRNA targeting clathrin suppressed Akt phosphorylation. We also identified the upstream molecules of the PI3K pathway. Virus infection induced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) but not Gab1, and blockage of FAK phosphorylation suppressed Akt phosphorylation. Blockage of PI3K/Akt activation increased virus RNA synthesis and viral yield. We also found that reovirus infection activated the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) in an interferon-independent manner and up-regulated IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) via the PI3K/Akt/EMSY pathway. Suppression of PI3K/Akt activation impaired the induction of ISRE and down-regulated the expression of ISGs. Overexpression of ISG15 and Viperin inhibited virus replication, and knockdown of either enhanced virus replication. Collectively, these results demonstrate that PI3K/Akt activated by mammalian reovirus serves as a pathway for sensing and then inhibiting virus replication/infection.

Renyi entropy and mutual information measurement of market expectations and investor fear during the COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously affected world economies. In this regard, it is expected that information level and sharing between equity, digital currency, and energy markets has been altered due to the pandemic outbreak. Specifically, the resulting twisted risk among markets is presumed to rise during the abnormal state of world economy. The purpose of the current study is twofold. First, by using Renyi entropy, we analyze the multiscale entropy function in the return time series of Bitcoin, S&P500, WTI, Brent, Gas, Gold, Silver, and investor fear index represented by VIX. Second, by estimating mutual information, we analyze the information sharing between these markets. The analyses are conducted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The empirical results from Renyi entropy indicate that for all market indices, randomness and disorder are more concentrated in less probable events. The empirical results from mutual information showed that the information sharing network between markets has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. From a managerial perspective, we conclude that during the pandemic (i) portfolios composed of Bitcoin and Silver, Bitcoin and WTI, Bitcoin and Gold, Bitcoin and Brent, or Bitcoin and S&P500 could be risky, (ii) diversification opportunities exist by investing in portfolios composed of Gas and Silver, Gold and Silver, Gold and Gas, Brent and Silver, Brent and Gold, or Bitcoin and Gas, and that (iii) the VIX exhibited the lowest level of information disorder at all scales before and during the pandemic. Thus, it seems that the pandemic has not influenced the expectations of investors. Our results provide an insight of the response of stocks, cryptocurrencies, energy, precious metal markets, to expectations of investors in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of information ordering and sharing.

Guidelines for primary health care-based telemental health in a low-to middle-income country: the case of Lebanon.

Significant efforts have been conducted to improve access to Mental Health Services (MHS) and reduce the burden of Mental Health Disorders (MHD) in Low-to Middle-Income Countries (LMIC). However, important challenges to accessing MHS still exist and limit improvements. Telemental Health (TMH), a modality that delivers remote MHS provides an ideal solution to complement existing efforts; however, there are limited reports on its implementation in developing countries such as Lebanon. This study presents the first roadmap for TMH applicability in Lebanon, with a focus on the Primary Health Care (PHC) setting, which has international relevance. We review existing guidelines and contextualise them to the Lebanese setting by addressing essential components for implementation. In specific, we shed light on 6 aspects: (1) patient population, (2) technological guidelines, (3) clinical guidelines, (4) administrative guidelines, (5) workforce, and (6) monitoring and evaluation. In addition, we acknowledge the important role of governmental efforts in setting the infrastructural and regulatory aspects for TMH practice. We provide guidance for public health professionals, government officials, and clinicians looking to adopt TMH practice in Lebanon or other countries with similar development and cultural landscapes.

Muscle activation and energy-requirements for varying postures in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy.

OBJECTIVE To determine energy expenditure and muscle activity among children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP), across several conditions that approximate sedentary behavior, and standing. STUDY DESIGN Subjects with spastic CP (n = 19; 4-20 years of age; Gross Motor Function Classification System Expanded and Revised [GMFCS-E&R] levels I-V) participated in this cohort study. Energy-expenditure and muscle activity were measured during lying supine, sitting with support, sitting without support, and standing. Energy-expenditure was measured using indirect calorimetry and expressed in metabolic equivalents (METs). Muscle activation was recorded using surface electromyography. The recorded values were calculated for every child and then averaged per posture. RESULTS Mean energy expenditure was >1.5 METs during standing for all GMFCS-E&R levels. There was a nonsignificant trend for greater muscle activation for all postures with less support. Only for children classified at GMFCS-E&R level III did standing result in significantly greater muscle activation (P < .05) compared with rest. CONCLUSIONS Across all GMFCS-E&R levels, children and adolescents with CP had elevated energy expenditure during standing that exceeded the sedentary threshold of 1.5 METs. Our findings suggest that changing a child's position to standing may contribute to the accumulation of light activity and reduction of long intervals of sedentary behavior.

Shell disorder analysis predicts greater resilience of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outside the body and in body fluids

The coronavirus (CoV) family consists of viruses that infects a variety of animals including humans with various levels of respiratory and fecal-oral transmission levels depending on the behavior of the viruses' natural hosts and optimal viral fitness. A model to classify and predict the levels of respective respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials of the various viruses was built before the outbreak of MERS-CoV using AI and empirically-based molecular tools to predict the disorder level of proteins. Using the percentages of intrinsic disorder (PID) of the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins of CoV, the model easily clustered the viruses into three groups with the SARS-CoV (M PID = 8%, N PID = 50%) falling into Category B, in which viruses have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials. Later, MERS-CoV (M PID = 9%, N PID = 44%) was found to be in Category C, which consists of viruses with lower respiratory transmission potential but with higher fecal-oral transmission capabilities. Based on the peculiarities of disorder distribution, the SARS-CoV-2 (M PID = 6%, N PID = 48%) has to be placed in Category B. Our data show however, that the SARS-CoV-2 is very strange with one of the hardest protective outer shell, (M PID = 6%) among coronaviruses. This means that it might be expected to be highly resilient in saliva or other body fluids and outside the body. An infected body is likelier to shed greater numbers of viral particles since the latter is more resistant to antimicrobial enzymes in body fluids. These particles are also likelier to remain active longer. These factors could account for the greater contagiousness of the SARS-CoV-2 and have implications for efforts to prevent its spread.

L-glutamine protects mouse brain from ischemic injury via up-regulating heat shock protein 70.

INTRODUCTION L-glutamine is an antioxidant that plays a role in a variety of biochemical processes. Given that oxidative stress is a key component of stroke pathology, the potential of L-glutamine in the treatment of ischemic stroke is worth exploring. AIMS In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanisms of action of L-glutamine after cerebral ischemic injury. RESULTS L-glutamine reduced brain infarct volume and promoted neurobehavioral recovery in mice. L-glutamine administration increased the expression of heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) in astrocytes and endothelial cells. Such effects were abolished by the coadministration of Apoptozole, an inhibitor of the ATPase activity of HSP70. L-glutamine also reduced oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis, and increased the level of superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Cotreatment with Apoptozole abolished these effects. Cell culture study further revealed that the conditioned medium from astrocytes cultured with L-glutamine reduced the apoptosis of neurons after oxygen-glucose deprivation. CONCLUSION L-glutamine attenuated ischemic brain injury and promoted functional recovery via HSP70, suggesting its potential in ischemic stroke therapy.

Global health security agenda and the international health regulations: moving forward.

The launch of the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) in February 2014 capped over a decade of global efforts to develop new approaches to emerging and reemerging infectious diseases-part of the growing recognition that disease events, whether natural, accidental, or intentional, threaten not just public health, but national, regional, and global security interests. In 2005, the United States, along with other Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO), adopted the revised International Health Regulations [IHR (2005)]. The IHR (2005) conferred new responsibilities on WHO and the global health community to coordinate resources for capacity building and emergency response, and on the now-196 States Parties to develop the core capacities required to detect, assess, report, and respond to potential public health emergencies of international concern. Both GHSA and the IHR aim to elevate political attention and encourage participation, coordination, and collaboration by multiple stakeholders, while leveraging previously existing commitments and multilateral efforts. GHSA and the IHR (2005) are platforms for action; how efforts under each will complement each other remains unclear. Mechanisms that measure progress under these 2 overlapping frameworks will aid in focusing resources and in sustaining political momentum for IHR implementation after 2016.

Risks of viral contamination in healthcare professionals during laparoscopy in the Covid-19 pandemic

Abstract The Covid-19 pandemic has markedly changed our practices. This article analyses the risks of contamination among healthcare professionals (HCPs) during laparoscopic surgery on patients with Covid-19. Harmful effects of aerosols from a pneumoperitoneum with the virus present have not yet been quantified. Measures for the protection of HCPs are an extrapolation of those taken during other epidemics. They must still be mandatory to minimise the risk of viral contamination. Protection measures include personal protection equipment for HCPs, adaptation of surgical technique (method for obtaining pneumoperitoneum, filters, preferred intracorporeal anastomosis, precautions during the exsufflation of the pneumoperitoneum), and organisation of the operating room.

Cross-Species Pathogen Transmission and Disease Emergence in Primates

Many of the most virulent emerging infectious diseases in humans, e.g., AIDS and Ebola, are zoonotic, having shifted from wildlife populations. Critical questions for predicting disease emergence are: (1) what determines when and where a disease will first cross from one species to another, and (2) which factors facilitate emergence after a successful host shift. In wild primates, infectious diseases most often are shared between species that are closely related and inhabit the same geographic region. Therefore, humans may be most vulnerable to diseases from the great apes, which include chimpanzees and gorillas, because these species represent our closest relatives. Geographic overlap may provide the opportunity for cross-species transmission, but successful infection and establishment will be determined by the biology of both the host and pathogen. We extrapolate the evolutionary relationship between pathogen sharing and divergence time between primate species to generate “hotspot” maps, highlighting regions where the risk of disease transfer between wild primates and from wild primates to humans is greatest. We find that central Africa and Amazonia are hotspots for cross-species transmission events between wild primates, due to a high diversity of closely related primate species. Hotspots of host shifts to humans will be most likely in the forests of central and west Africa, where humans come into frequent contact with their wild primate relatives. These areas also are likely to sustain a novel epidemic due to their rapidly growing human populations, close proximity to apes, and population centers with high density and contact rates among individuals.

Bat Flies and Their Microparasites: Current Knowledge and Distribution

Bats are the second most diverse mammalian group, playing keystone roles in ecosystems but also act as reservoir hosts for numerous pathogens. Due to their colonial habits which implies close contacts between individuals, bats are often parasitized by multiple species of micro- and macroparasites. The particular ecology, behavior, and environment of bat species may shape patterns of intra- and interspecific pathogen transmission, as well as the presence of specific vectorial organisms. This review synthetizes information on a multi-level parasitic system: bats, bat flies and their microparasites. Bat flies (Diptera: Nycteribiidae and Streblidae) are obligate, hematophagous ectoparasites of bats consisting of ~500 described species. Diverse parasitic organisms have been detected in bat flies including bacteria, blood parasites, fungi, and viruses, which suggest their vectorial potential. We discuss the ecological epidemiology of microparasites, their potential physiological effects on both bats and bat flies, and potential research perspectives in the domain of bat pathogens. For simplicity, we use the term microparasite throughout this review, yet it remains unclear whether some bacteria are parasites or symbionts of their bat fly hosts.

Adjunct immunotherapies for the management of severely ill COVID-19 patients

Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has infected millions with more than 181,000 fatal cases as of 22nd April 2020. Currently, there are no specific COVID-19 therapies. Most patients depend on mechanical ventilation. Current COVID-19 data clearly highlight that cytokine storm and activated immune cell migration to the lungs characterize the early immune response to COVID-19 that causes severe lung damage and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. In view of uncertainty associated with immunosuppressive treatments such as corticosteroids and their possible secondary effects, including risks of secondary infections, we suggest immunotherapies as an adjunct therapy in severe COVID-19 cases. Such immunotherapies based on inflammatory cytokine neutralization, immunomodulation and passive viral neutralization, not only reduce inflammation, inflammation-associated lung damage, or viral load, but could also prevent intensive care unit hospitalization and dependency on mechanical ventilation both of which are limited resources.

Emerging zoonoses: responsible communication with the media—lessons learned and future perspectives

Abstract Emerging zoonotic disease outbreaks are inevitable and often unpredictable events. The environment surrounding an outbreak is unique in public health, and outbreaks are frequently marked by uncertainty, confusion and a sense of urgency. Good communication at this time, generally through the media, is essential, but examples unfortunately abound of communication failures that have delayed outbreak control, undermined public trust and compliance, and unnecessarily prolonged economic, social and political turmoil. With this paper we hope to disseminate the idea that communication expertise has become as essential to outbreak control as epidemiological training and laboratory analysis. The paper presents the best practices for communicating with the public and discusses future aspects of communicating through the mass media during an outbreak.

Pregnancy, Birth and the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States.

How quickly and in what ways are US maternity care practices changing due to the COVID-19 pandemic? Our data indicate that partners and doulas are being excluded from birthing rooms leaving mothers unsupported, while providers face lack of protective equipment and unclear guidelines. We investigate rapidly shifting protocols for in- and out-of-hospital births and the decision making behind them. We ask, will COVID-19 cause women, families, and providers to look at birthing in a different light? And will this pandemic offer a testing ground for future policy changes to generate effective maternity care amidst pandemics and other types of disasters?

The role and response of palliative care and hospice services in epidemics and pandemics: a rapid review to inform practice during the COVID-19 pandemic

Abstract Cases of COVID-19 are escalating rapidly across the globe, with the mortality risk being especially high among those with existing illness and multimorbidity. This study aimed to synthesise evidence for the role and response of palliative care and hospice teams to viral epi/pandemics, to inform the COVID-19 pandemic response. We conducted a rapid systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines in five databases. Of 3094 papers identified, ten were included in this narrative synthesis. Included studies were from West Africa, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, the United States and Italy. All had an observational design. Findings were synthesised using a previously proposed framework according to ‘systems’ (policies, training and protocols, communication and coordination, data), ‘staff’ (deployment, skill mix, resilience), ‘space’ (community provision, use of technology) and ‘stuff’ (medicines and equipment, personal protective equipment). We conclude that hospice and palliative services have an essential role in the response to COVID-19 by: 1) responding rapidly and flexibly; 2) ensuring protocols for symptom management are available, and training non-specialists in their use; 3) being involved in triage; 4) considering shifting resources into the community; 5) considering redeploying volunteers to provide psychosocial and bereavement care; 6) facilitating camaraderie among staff and adopt measures to deal with stress; 7) using technology to communicate with patients and carers; 8) adopting standardised data collection systems to inform operational changes and improve care.

Host protein chaperones, RNA helicases and the ubiquitin network highlight the arms race for resources between tombusviruses and their hosts

Positive-strand RNA viruses need to arrogate many cellular resources to support their replication and infection cycles. These viruses co-opt host factors, lipids and subcellular membranes and exploit cellular metabolites to built viral replication organelles in infected cells. However, the host cells have their defensive arsenal of factors to protect themselves from easy exploitation by viruses. In this review, the author discusses an emerging arms race for cellular resources between viruses and hosts, which occur during the early events of virus-host interactions. Recent findings with tomato bushy stunt virus and its hosts revealed that the need of the virus to exploit and co-opt given members of protein families provides an opportunity for the host to deploy additional members of the same or associated protein family to interfere with virus replication. Three examples with well-established heat shock protein 70 and RNA helicase protein families and the ubiquitin network will be described to illustrate this model on the early arms race for cellular resources between tombusviruses and their hosts. We predict that arms race for resources with additional cellular protein families will be discovered with tombusviruses. These advances will fortify research on interactions among other plant and animal viruses and their hosts.

Clinical, virologic, and serologic evidence of Epstein-Barr virus infection in association with childhood pneumonia()

To explore the association of Epstein-Barr virus infection with childhood pneumonia we studied two patients whose mononucleosis-like illnesses were accompanied by pneumonia; both had virologic and serologic evidence of current or recent EBV infection. We then analyzed the sera of 71 children (age range, 14 months to 9 years) with pulmonary infiltrates for the presence of four classes of antibody to EBV. Antibody responses consistent with current or recent EB virus infection were found in 15. Two children had IgM antibodies to the EBV viral antigen at titers ≥1:160, indicating current infection, and all 15 patients had antibody to components of the early antigen complex, suggesting recent infection. A fourfold rise or drop in one or more EBV-specific antibody classes was noted in eight patients within 30 days following onset of clinical illness. Few patients had clinical features suggesting infectious mononucleosis. Eight of the 15 with serologic evidence of current or recent EBV infection also had clinical or serologic evidence of infection with another pathogen-bacterial, viral, or mycoplasmal. Thus, in childhood pneumonia, EBV may be a primary, co-primary, or secondary pathogen; it may be reactivated in the course of infection with another agent, or possibly, by suppressing immune function, it may precipitate infection with some other organism.

In the past several months, the outbreak of SARS‐CoV‐2‐associated infection (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID‐19) developed rapidly and has turned into a global pandemic. Although SARS‐CoV‐2 mainly attacks respiratory systems, manifestations of multiple organs have been observed. Great concern was raised about whether COVID‐19 may affect male reproductive functions. In this study, we collected semen specimens from twelve male COVID‐19 patients for virus detection and semen characteristics analysis. No SARS‐CoV‐2 was found in semen specimens. 8 out of 12 patients had normal semen quality. We also compared the sex‐related hormone levels between 119 reproductive‐aged men with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and 273 age‐matched control men. A higher serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and a lower ratio of testosterone (T) to LH were observed in the COVID‐19 group. Multiple regression analysis indicated that serum T:LH ratio was negatively associated with white blood cell counts (WBC) and c‐reactive protein (CRP) level in COVID‐19 patients. It's the first report about semen assessment and sex‐hormone evaluation in reproductive‐aged male COVID‐19 patients. Although further study is needed to clarify the reasons and underlying mechanisms, our study presents an abnormal sex hormone secretion among COVID‐19 patients, suggesting that attention should be paid to reproductive function evaluation in the follow‐up.

The proton pump inhibitor, lansoprazole, prevents the development of non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head: an experimental and prospective clinical trial

BACKGROUND: An effective prevention strategy for osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) has yet to be established. We previously reported that the innate immune system via the toll-like receptor (TLR) response induced by corticosteroids leads to the development of ONFH and that repression of IRF7 activity by an inhibitor could interfere with the development of ONFH while maintaining the therapeutic effect of the corticosteroids. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we hypothesize that lansoprazole has the potential to suppress IRF7 activity and prevent corticosteroid-induced ONFH in rats. Furthermore, we conducted a preliminary clinical trial to prevent corticosteroid-induced ONFH in autoimmune disease patients. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups. On Day 1, each rat was injected with TLR4 ligand (LPS) or TLR7 ligand (imiquimod), followed by methylprednisolone with or without lansoprazole on Day 2. They were killed at 1 or 14 days after the last injection.We prospectively recruited 30 patients requiring primary high-dose corticosteroid treatment for immune diseases. All patients were administered lansoprazole, starting the night before corticosteroid treatment began. MRI was performed before corticosteroid treatment, and at 4, 12 and 24 weeks afterward. RESULTS: In rats, co-treatment of lansoprazole with corticosteroids significantly repressed both IRF7 activity and the development of ONFH. Moreover, in the human patients, the incidence of ONFH was significantly decreased from 53.4 to 13.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Although the present study is preliminary, the results show that co-treatment of lansoprazole with corticosteroids prevents ONFH development. Lansoprazole may be both safe and effective in preventing osteonecrosis of the femoral head in patients needing corticosteroid treatment.

HIV-1 and Its gp120 Inhibits the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Life Cycle in an IFITM3-Dependent Fashion

HIV-1-infected patients co-infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 surprisingly presented benign clinical outcome. The knowledge that HIV-1 changes the host homeostatic equilibrium, which may favor the patient resistance to some co-pathogens, prompted us to investigate whether HIV-1 infection could influence A(H1N1)pdm09 life cycle in vitro. We show here that exposure of A(H1N1)pdm09-infected epithelial cells to HIV-1 viral particles or its gp120 enhanced by 25% the IFITM3 content, resulting in a decrease in influenza replication. This event was dependent on toll-like receptor 2 and 4. Moreover, knockdown of IFITM3 prevented HIV-1 ability to inhibit A(H1N1)pdm09 replication. HIV-1 infection also increased IFITM3 levels in human primary macrophages by almost 100%. Consequently, the arrival of influenza ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to nucleus of macrophages was inhibited, as evaluated by different approaches. Reduction of influenza RNPs entry into the nucleus tolled A(H1N1)pdm09 life cycle in macrophages earlier than usual, limiting influenza's ability to induce TNF-α. As judged by analysis of the influenza hemagglutin (HA) gene from in vitro experiments and from samples of HIV-1/A(H1N1)pdm09 co-infected individuals, the HIV-1-induced reduction of influenza replication resulted in delayed viral evolution. Our results may provide insights on the mechanisms that may have attenuated the clinical course of Influenza in HIV-1/A(H1N1)pdm09 co-infected patients during the recent influenza form 2009/2010.

Association of cerebral oxygenation with estimated glomerular filtration rate and cognitive function in chronic kidney disease patients without dialysis therapy.

BACKGROUND A decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is reportedly associated with increased prevalence rates of cognitive impairment. However, data concerning the association between the cerebral saturation of oxygen (rSO2) and cognitive function of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is limited. This study aimed to (i) elucidate the clinical factors associating with cerebral rSO2 and (ii) investigate the association between cerebral rSO2 and cognitive assessment in CKD patients. METHODS A total of 40 CKD patients not requiring dialysis (26 men and 14 women; mean age, 61.0 ± 2.7 years) were recruited. The numbers of patients at each CKD stage were as follows: G1, 5; G2, 8; G3a, 6; G3b, 5; G4, 11; and G5, 5. Cerebral rSO2 was monitored at the forehead using the oxygen saturation monitor INVOS 5100C. The cognitive function of each patient was confirmed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). RESULTS Cerebral rSO2 levels were significantly higher in CKD patients than in hemodialysis patients (63.8 ± 1.5% vs. 44.9 ± 2.2%, p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that cerebral rSO2 was independently associated with eGFR (standardized coefficient: 0.530), serum albumin concentration (standardized coefficient: 0.365), and serum sodium concentration (standardized coefficient: 0.224). Furthermore, MMSE showed a significantly positive correlation with cerebral rSO2 (r = 0.624, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Cerebral rSO2 was affected by eGFR and serum albumin and sodium concentrations in CKD patients. Furthermore, cerebral rSO2 monitoring, which reflected MMSE scores, might be a useful method for assessing cognitive function in CKD patients.

Proning in Non-Intubated (PINI) in Times of COVID-19: Case Series and a Review.

It has been well known for decades that prone positioning (PP) improves oxygenation. However, it has gained widespread acceptance only in the last few years since studies have shown significant survival benefit. Many centers have established prone ventilation in their treatment algorithm for mechanically ventilated patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Physiologically, PP should also benefit awake, non-intubated patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. However, proning in non-intubated (PINI) patients did not gain any momentum until a few months ago when the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic surged. A large number of sick patients overwhelmed the health care system, and many centers faced a dearth of ventilators. In addition, outcomes of patients placed on mechanical ventilation because of COVID-19 infection have been highly variable and often dismal. Hence, increased focus has shifted to using various strategies to prevent intubation, such as PINI. There is accumulating evidence that PINI is a low-risk intervention that can be performed even outside intensive care unit with minimal assistance and may prevent intubation in certain patients with ARDS. It can also be performed safely at smaller centers and, therefore, may reduce the patient transfer to larger institutions that are overwhelmed in the current crisis. We present a case series of 2 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure who experienced significant improvements in oxygenation with PP. In addition, the physiology of PP is described, and concerns such as proning in obese and patient's anxiety are addressed; an educational pamphlet that may be useful for both patients and health care providers is provided.

Aesthetics in Thyroid Surgery: The Patient Perspective.

Objectives To define characteristics that influence patient perceptions of thyroidectomy scar cosmesis. Study Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Tertiary endocrine surgery practice in an academic medical center. Subjects and Methods Institutional review board-approved trial in which 136 subjects were recruited from a population of patients being seen for either thyroid or sinus surgery and evaluated standardized photographs, superimposed with computer-generated thyroidectomy scars of varying lengths (2, 4, and 6 cm) and widths (1 and 2 mm), and graded their perception of the scars using the observer scar assessment scale (OSAS) domains of the patient and observer scar assessment scale. Results There were 69 subjects in the thyroid group and 67 in the nonthyroid group. Controlling for width, longer scars were perceived as worse than shorter scars; controlling for length, thicker scars were perceived as worse than thinner scars ( P < .01). Beyond 2 cm, thick scars were judged to be worse than thin scars, even when they were shorter. There was no difference in the mean overall OSAS scores between surgery, sex, or age groups. Nonwhites tended to judge scars as being worse than whites did ( P < .01). Conclusion As expected, patients of all demographics prefer shorter scars compared with longer scars and thinner scars over thick scars. Ethnic differences in scar perception were identified and deserve additional study. Surgeons should endeavor to perform thyroid surgery through the smallest incision that allows the operation to be performed safely to minimize the cosmetic impact of the operation.

Three cases of idiopathic eosinophilic enteritis with chronic obstinate diarrhea in Japanese Black fattening cattle

Eosinophilic enteritis (EOE) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease and is characterized clinically by chronic obstinate diarrhea. Three Japanese Black (JB) fattening cattle (2 males and 1 female) on different cattle farms presented with chronic episodic diarrhea without fever or dehydration. Soft reddish spherical carneous tissues (1−3 cm) were occasionally excreted within the diarrheic feces. Administration of antibiotics, antidiarrheal drugs and vermicides had no therapeutic effect, but dexamethasone improved the fecal characteristics. The symptoms persisted until the animals were slaughtered at 27–30 months of age. Histopathological examination of the intestines revealed marked eosinophilic infiltration in the lamina propria and submucosa. From these findings, we diagnosed these cattle as the first cases of EOE in JB cattle.

Uncertainty in IoT for Smart Healthcare: Challenges, and Opportunities

According to Knight, uncertainty signifies deviations from the expected states, which prevent us from the use of any probability for the determination of a result for a given action or decision [1]. This paper describes the phenomenon of uncertainty in the face of technological megatrends and challenges associated with them. The article focuses on the analysis of the uncertainty in one of the most important technology trends – the Internet of Things (IoT) – on the example of Healthcare. The right decisions are not always equivalent to good results. Sometimes, the decision taken in accordance with general rules brings worse results than the one who breaks them. Such a situation is possible as a result of the uncertainty accompanying the predictions of the future. In this article the concept of the IoT is treated as a big, complex, dynamic system with specific characteristics, dimensions. structures and behaviors. The aim of the article is to analyze the factors that may determine the uncertainty and ambiguity of such systems in the context of the development of Healthcare, and recommendations are made for future research directions.

Doubling down on austerity: Framing and coronavirus response

Even amid a global pandemic, the ideologies, thought processes, and motivations of public actors can be explained through theory, particularly framing. We argue that the words and symbols used or not used are vitally important to shaping how the public understands, responds to, and navigates our new normal. Moreover, this framing shapes our collective understanding of who or what is valued. We posit that austerity politics at all levels of government has not only helped to create a patchwork system of crisis response, but also explains the variation in framing of the pandemic response as tradeoffs among competing values (e.g., equity versus economy; us versus other; health versus business). The success or failure of these frames can lead to an environment in which administrative evil flourishes.

The occurrence of polyomaviruses WUPyV and KIPyV among patients with severe respiratory infections

In 2007, the new polyomaviruses WUPyV and KIPyV were identified in patients with acute respiratory infections. The aim of this study was to investigate these viruses in hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). A retrospective study was conducted with 251 patients, from April 2009 to November 2010, using nasopharyngeal aspirates, naso- and oropharyngeal swab samples from hospitalized patients (children < 12 years and adults) who had SARI within 7 days of the onset of symptoms, including fever (> 38.8 °C), dyspnea, and cough. Clinical and epidemiological information was obtained through standardized questionnaire. Enrolled patients were initially suspected to have influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infections. WUPyV and KIPyV were detected by real-time PCR. Samples were also tested for influenza A and B viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses. WUPyV and KIPyV were detected in 6.77% (4.78% and 1.99%, respectively) of hospitalized patients with SARI. All samples from children showed coinfections (rhinovirus was the most commonly detected). Six adults had polyomavirus infection and four (1.6%) had monoinfection. Of them, 3 reported comorbidities including immunosuppression and 1 patient had worse outcome, requiring ICU admission. These preliminary data may suggest a possible role of polyomaviruses in SARI among immunocompromised adult patients.

Initial experience of transanal total mesorectal excision with rigid or flexible transanal platforms in cadavers.

BACKGROUND Transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) is expected to provide benefits in the removal of the complete mesorectum for low rectal lesions, and several clinical studies regarding this technique have been reported. However, a transanal platform has not yet been standardized, and diverse transanal endoluminal surgery access devices have been used, based on individual surgeon preferences. In the present study, we performed laparoscopy-assisted taTME in cadavers and compared the characteristics of four different platforms. METHODS Between January 2013 and April 2015, laparoscopy-assisted taTME was performed on six fresh cadavers. Flexible [SILS™ Port (Covidien), GelPOINT(®) Path Transanal Access Platform (Applied Medical)] and rigid [TEO(®) (Karl Storz Endoskope), TEM (Richard Wolf)] transanal access platforms were used on three cadavers each. RESULTS All cadavers were male, with a mean age of 69.2 (range 57-86) years. The mean operation time was 146.3 (range 140-155) min with flexible platforms and 206.7 (range 150-260) min with rigid platforms. The mean specimen length was 23 (range 18-26) cm. Complete or nearly complete mesorectal specimens were obtained in all cases, except for one case using the TEM platform. Flexible platforms (SILS and GelPOINT) provided a short set-up time, relatively atraumatic retraction, and easy application of familiar laparoscopic instruments; a narrow operative field was its limitation. The rigid platforms (TEO and TEM) enabled larger and more stable operative fields and space than did the SILS platform, but they were limited by a narrow view, prolonged set-up time, rigidity, and long channels relative to the short distance from the anus to the rectal closure site. CONCLUSION In this preliminary study, laparoscopy-assisted taTME was a feasible and safe procedure using both rigid and soft platforms, despite some limitations of each platform.

Polymorphisms in the human surfactant protein-D (SFTPD) gene: strong evidence that serum levels of surfactant protein-D (SP-D) are genetically influenced

The collectin surfactant protein-D (SP-D) plays a significant role in innate immunity. Epidemiological studies described associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the human gene coding surfactant protein-D (SFTPD) and infectious pulmonary diseases. Studies on twins indicated very strong genetic dependence for serum levels of SP-D. The aim of this study was to determine the genetic influence of sequence variations within the SFTPD gene on the constitutional serum SP-D levels. We sequenced the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR), the coding region and the 3′ region of the SFTPD gene of 32 randomly selected blood donors. Six validated SNPs were genotyped with sequence-specific probes (TaqMan 7000) in 290 German blood donors. Serum SP-D levels were analysed by ELISA, and the association of SFTPD haplotype estimates with the quantitative phenotype serum SP-D level was determined. One single SFTPD haplotype (allele frequency 13.53%) revealed a negative association with serum SP-D levels (P<0.0001). This was confirmed in a second prospectively collected group of blood donors (n=160, P=0.0034). The discovery of a frequent negative variant of the SFTPD gene provides a basis for genetic analysis of the function of SP-D in the resistance against pulmonary infections and inflammatory disorders in humans.

Determination of efficacy of a novel alginate dressing in a lethal arterial injury model in swine.

INTRODUCTION Alginate is a biocompatible polysaccharide that is commonly used in the pharmaceutical, biomedical, cosmetic, and food industries. Though solid dressings composed of alginate can absorb water and promote wound healing, they are not effective hemostatic materials, particularly against massive hemorrhage. The purpose of this study is to attempt to increase the hemostatic capabilities of alginate by means of hydrophobic modification. Previous studies have illustrated that modifying a different polysaccharide, chitosan, in this way enhances its hemostatic efficacy as well as its adhesion to tissue. Here, it was hypothesized that modifying alginate with hydrophobic groups would demonstrate analogous effects. METHODS Fifteen Yorkshire swine were randomized to receive hydrophobically-modified (hm) alginate lyophilized sponges (n=5), unmodified alginate lyophilized sponges (n=5), or standard Kerlix™ gauze dressing (n=5) for hemostatic control. Following a splenectomy, arterial puncture (6mm punch) of the femoral artery was made. Wounds were allowed to freely bleed for 30s, at which time dressings were applied and compressed for 3min in a randomized fashion. Fluid resuscitation was given to preserve the baseline mean arterial pressure. Wounds were monitored for 180min after arterial puncture, and surviving animals were euthanized. RESULTS Blood loss for the hm-alginate group was significantly less than the two control groups of (1) alginate and (2) Kerlix™ gauze (p=<0.0001). Furthermore, 80% of hm-alginate sponges were able to sustain hemostasis for the full 180min, whereas 0% of dressings from the control groups were able to achieve initial hemostasis. CONCLUSIONS Hm-alginate demonstrates a greatly superior efficacy, relative to unmodified alginate and Kerlix™ gauze dressings, in achieving hemostasis from a lethal femoral artery puncture in swine. This is a similar result as has been previously described when performing hydrophobic modification to chitosan. The current study further suggests that hydrophobic modification of a hydrophilic biopolymer backbone can significantly increase the hemostatic capabilities relative to the native biopolymer.

Scalable Transcriptional Analysis Routine—Multiplexed Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Platform for Gene Expression Analysis and Molecular Diagnostics

We report the development of a new technology for simultaneous quantitative detection of multiple targets in a single sample. Scalable transcriptional analysis routine (STAR) represents a novel integration of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and capillary electrophoresis that allows detection of dozens of gene transcripts in a multiplexed format using amplicon size as an identifier for each target. STAR demonstrated similar or better sensitivity and precision compared to two commonly used methods, SYBR Green-based and TaqMan probe-based real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. STAR can be used as a flexible platform for building a variety of applications to monitor gene expression, from single gene assays to assays analyzing the expression level of multiple genes. Using severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus as a model system, STAR technology detected single copies of the viral genome in a two-gene multiplex. Blinded studies using RNA extracted from various tissues of a SARS-infected individual showed that STAR correctly identified all samples containing SARS virus and yielded negative results for non-SARS control samples. Using alternate priming strategies, STAR technology can be adapted to transcriptional profiling studies without requiring a priori sequence information. Thus, STAR technology offers a flexible platform for development of highly multiplexed assays in gene expression analysis and molecular diagnostics.

Systems pharmacology uncovers Janus functions of botanical drugs: activation of host defense system and inhibition of influenza virus replication

Given the imminent threat of influenza pandemics and continuing emergence of new drug-resistant influenza virus strains, novel strategies for preventing and treating influenza disease are urgently needed. Herbal medicine, used for thousands of years in combinational therapies (Herb Formula), plays a significant role in stimulating the host immune system in vivo, and meanwhile, in fighting against the pandemic by directly inhibiting influenza virus in vitro. Such potential Janus functions may spark interest in therapeutic manipulation of virus diseases. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanism of the Janus functions of the medicinal herbs in the treatment of influenza remains unclear. In this work, to illustrate the therapeutic concept of Janus functions in the treatment of influenza, we have introduced a novel systems pharmacology model that integrates pharmacokinetic screening, targeting and network analysis of two representative herbs Lonicera japonica and Fructus Forsythiae that are efficient in the treatment of influenza, inflammation and other diseases. 50 Chemicals with favorable pharmacokinetic profiles have been identified for the two herbs, and the ligand–target network was constructed by complementing the literature-based experimental data deposited in DrugBank. The annotation of these chemicals was assigned using a novel drug targeting approach, and mapped to target–disease and drug–target–pathway networks. The overall data suggest that the medicinal herbs function by indirectly suppressing the virus proliferation via regulating the immune systems in hosts, and also, by directly inhibiting virus proliferation through targeting viral proteins essential for the viral life cycle. For the first time, we have demonstrated the mechanism of medicinal herbs in prevention and treatment of virus diseases via the Janus functions on a systematic level.

The invisible victims - Impact of the pandemic on patients without COVID-19.

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has shocked the world to a standstill. Routine healthcare has been severely disrupted. Healthcare service is a finite resource and in the current pandemic situation the risks of providing care to individual patients, whether they be confirmed, probable or suspected cases, should be balanced against the ability to provide safe routine long-term care to others. But how far can the healthcare system protect itself and fear the unknown, before it starts causing harm by omission? Herein we provide a review of cases that were misdiagnosed, left stranded in the system or had to face unnecessary delays due to the lack of an organised pathway.

Traumatologie und gewaltsamer Tod

Vorgeschichte: Eine 39 Jahre alt gewordene, alkoholabhängige Frau habe von ihrem Hausarzt eine Packung Distraneurinkapseln (25 Stück) verschrieben bekommen; sie solle morgens und mittags je 1, abends 2 Kapseln einnehmen. Aus der Apotheke zurück gekehrt, begann sie zu Hause, mit ihrem Ehemann Alkohol zu trinken. Es sei zu einem Streit gekommen, in dessen Verlauf die Frau die Polizei angerufen habe. Der Ehemann sei daraufhin gegen 17.00 Uhr in Gewahrsam genommen und zur Wache verbracht worden. Ein Atemalkoholtest habe einen Atemalkoholwert von 1,29 mg/l ergeben. Gegen 04.00 Uhr morgens sei der Ehemann wieder entlassen worden (!). Er selbst habe angegeben, seine Ehefrau schlafend auf dem Sofa angetroffen zu haben; er habe sie geweckt, sie habe u.a. zu ihm gesagt, dass sie die Distraneurintabletten eingenommen habe. Ihr Zustand habe sich deutlich von dem bei sonstiger Alkoholisierung unterschieden. Gegen 05.30 Uhr habe er den Notarzt verständigt, der nur noch den Tod feststellen konnte.

The end of social confinement and COVID-19 re-emergence risk

The lack of effective pharmaceutical interventions for SARS-CoV-2 raises the possibility of COVID-19 recurrence. We explore different post-confinement scenarios by using a stochastic modified SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model that accounts for the spread of infection during the latent period and also incorporates time-decaying effects due to potential loss of acquired immunity, people's increasing awareness of social distancing and the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our results suggest that lockdowns should remain in place for at least 60 days to prevent epidemic growth, as well as a potentially larger second wave of SARS-CoV-2 cases occurring within months. The best-case scenario should also gradually incorporate workers in a daily proportion at most 50% higher than during the confinement period. We show that decaying immunity and particularly awareness and behaviour have 99% significant effects on both the current wave of infection and on preventing COVID-19 re-emergence. Social distancing and individual non-pharmaceutical interventions could potentially remove the need for lockdowns.

Neurophysiologic predictors of response to atomoxetine in young adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: a pilot project.

Atomoxetine is a non-stimulant medication with sustained benefit throughout the day, and is a useful pharmacologic treatment option for young adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It is difficult to determine, however, those patients for whom atomoxetine will be both effective and advantageous. Patients may need to take the medication for several weeks before therapeutic benefit is apparent, so a biomarker that could predict atomoxetine effectiveness early in the course of treatment could be clinically useful. There has been increased interest in the study of thalamocortical oscillatory activity using quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) as a biomarker in ADHD. In this study, we investigated qEEG absolute power, relative power, and cordance, which have been shown to predict response to reuptake inhibitor antidepressants in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), as potential predictors of response to atomoxetine. Forty-four young adults with ADHD (ages 18-30) enrolled in a multi-site, double-blind placebo-controlled study of the effectiveness of atomoxetine and underwent serial qEEG recordings at pretreatment baseline and one week after the start of medication. qEEG measures were calculated from a subset of the sample (N = 29) that provided useable qEEG recordings. Left temporoparietal cordance in the theta frequency band after one week of treatment was associated with ADHD symptom improvement and quality of life measured at 12 weeks in atomoxetine-treated subjects, but not in those treated with placebo. Neither absolute nor relative power measures selectively predicted improvement in medication-treated subjects. Measuring theta cordance after one week of treatment could be useful in predicting atomoxetine treatment response in adult ADHD.

Laparoscopic appendectomy: quality care and cost-effectiveness for today's economy.

BACKGROUND Open appendectomy (OA) has traditionally been the treatment for acute appendicitis (AA). Beneficial effects of laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) for the treatment of AA are still controversial. AIM To present our technique for LA and to determine whether LA should be the technique of choice of any case of AA instead of OA. MATERIAL AND METHODS All cases operated for AA (February 2011 through February 2012) by means of LA or OA were prospectively evaluated. Data regarding length of stay, complications, emergency department consultation after discharge or readmission were collected. Patients were classified into four groups depending on the severity of the appendicitis. Economic data were obtained based on the cost of the disposable material. Cost of hospital stay was calculated based on the Ley de Tasas of the Generalitat Valenciana according to the DRG and the length of stay. RESULTS One hundred and forty-two cases were included. Ninety-nine patients underwent OA and 43 LA. Average length of stay for LA group was 2,6 days and 3,8 for OA. Average cost of the stay for OA was 1.799 euros and 1.081 euros for LA. Global morbidity rate was 16%, 5% for LA and 20% for OA. CONCLUSIONS LA is nowadays the technique of choice for the treatment of AA.

Pheochromocytoma does not increase risk in laparoscopic adrenalectomy.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) has become the standard approach to an adrenal mass. This technique provides for decreased convalescence, less postoperative pain, and improved cosmesis. The use of LA for pheochromocytoma (PHE) has been questioned due to concerns of increased morbidity and negative hemodynamic sequelae. This study aimed to compare the outcomes of LA for PHE with the results of LA for other adrenal pathologies. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed for an 11-year period from July 1997 to December 2008. Patient demographics, perioperative data, and outcomes were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0. Statistical significance was defined as a p value less than 0.05. RESULTS A total of 102 LA procedures were completed for 95 patients. The data for 33 PHE cases were compared with the data for 69 non-PHE cases (26 adenomas, 14 aldosteronomas, 5 cortisol-secreting tumors, 5 multinodular hyperplasias, and 19 other disorders). Five LA procedures were converted to open surgery. Four of these conversions involved patients with PHE (p = 0.03). There was no difference in the mean estimated blood loss (p = 0.2) or operative time (p = 0.1) between the two groups. The frequency of intraoperative hypertension and hypotension did not differ between the PHE and non-PHE cohorts. The complication rate was 7.5% for the PHE group and 6.9% for the non-PHE group (p = 0.7). The patients with PHE had a longer postoperative hospital stay (3.6 vs 2.3 days; p < 0.001) and overall hospital stay (4.9 vs 2.6 days; p < 0.001). Time in the intensive care unit (1.1 vs 0.1 days; p < 0.001) and time until oral intake (1.5 vs 1.0 days; p = 0.02) also were increased in the PHE population. There was one death in the PHE group secondary to congestive heart failure. CONCLUSIONS Concerns of increased morbidity related to a laparoscopic approach for patients with a diagnosis of PHE are unfounded. In this series, the only disparity in outcomes between the two groups was an increased conversion rate with PHE.

Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of amino acid and peptide derivatives of mycophenolic acid

The series of 16 novel amino acid and peptide mycophenolic acid (MPA) derivatives was obtained as potential antibacterial agents. Coupling of MPA with respective amines was optimized with condensing reagents such as EDCI/DMAP and T3P/TEA. Amino acid analogs were received both as methyl esters and also with the free carboxylic group. The biological activity of the products was tested on five references bacterial strains: Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (ESBL), Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus MRSA ATCC 43300, Staphylococcus aureus MSSA ATCC 25923. Peptide derivatives proved to be the most versatile ones, their MIC values relative to most strains was lower than MPA alone. It has been noted that the activity of amino acid derivatives depends on the configuration at the chiral center in the amino acid unit and methyl esters indicated better antimicrobial activity than analogs with free carboxylic group.

[Analysis of acute physiology and chronic health evaluation III in the 54 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome].

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation III (APACHE III) in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients and its significance in prognosis. METHODS The clinical data of 54 SARS patients, including survivors (43 cases) and nonsurvivors (11 cases) were collected and evaluated with APACHE III scoring system. The correlation of scores and prognosis was evaluated. RESULTS The scores of the nonsurvivors were higher remarkably than those of the surviving group(P<00.01). The scores of the acute physiology score (APS) and year score (YS) in the death group were higher obviously than those of the surviving group(both P<0.01). Elderly patients with severe disease had a high mortality. The scores of APACHE III had positive correlation with the over all fatality rate. When the scores of APACHE III was higher than 60, the fatality rate increased obviously. CONCLUSION The scores of APACHE III in the SARS are correlated with the patient's condition and prognosis.

Immunopurification applied to the study of virus protein composition and encapsidation

Abstract A protocol for obtaining small amounts of highly pure virus preparations starting from reduced volumes (<5ml) of infected tissue culture supernatants is described. This procedure was adapted to the study of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) protein composition and RNA encapsidation. This protocol relies on virion capture by monoclonal antibodies specific for a virion membrane protein. These antibodies were bound to protein A-coated ELISA wells armed with rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies. As an example, the purification of 35S-labelled TGEV virions was performed. The quality of virus preparations was assessed by quantifying common contaminating RNAs by real-time RT-PCR. The most critical factors influencing the purity degree are analysed and discussed.

Togaviridae.

The family Togaviridae comprises four genera: Alphavirus (with 26 species), Rubivirus (one species), Pestivirus (three species), and Arterivirus (one species). The main characteristics of the member viruses are: (i) the virus particles are spherical, 50-70 nm in diameter, including an envelope with surface projections that incorporate two or three polypeptides, usually glycosylated; (ii) the nucleocapsid comprises a core protein and a single strand of positive-sense RNA, molecular weight about 4 X 10(6); where characterized, the RNA has an m7G 'cap' at the 5' end and is polyadenylated at the 3' end; (iii) maturation occurs by budding of spherical nucleocapsids 30-35 nm in diameter, with proven or presumed icosahedral symmetry, through cytoplasmic membranes. Where characterized, translation of structural proteins occurs on subgenomic messenger RNA(s); these appear to represent the 3' end of the genome. Nearly all alphavirus species are transmitted by mosquitoes. Transmission also occurs transovarially (Alphavirus) or transplacentally (Rubivirus and Pestivirus). Members of a genus are serologically related, but are not related to members of other genera.

Natural mutations in IFITM3 modulate post‐translational regulation and toggle antiviral specificity

The interferon‐induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins protect host cells from diverse virus infections. IFITM proteins also incorporate into HIV‐1 virions and inhibit virus fusion and cell‐to‐cell spread, with IFITM3 showing the greatest potency. Here, we report that amino‐terminal mutants of IFITM3 preventing ubiquitination and endocytosis are more abundantly incorporated into virions and exhibit enhanced inhibition of HIV‐1 fusion. An analysis of primate genomes revealed that IFITM3 is the most ancient antiviral family member of the IFITM locus and has undergone a repeated duplication in independent host lineages. Some IFITM3 genes in nonhuman primates, including those that arose following gene duplication, carry amino‐terminal mutations that modify protein localization and function. This suggests that “runaway” IFITM3 variants could be selected for altered antiviral activity. Furthermore, we show that adaptations in IFITM3 result in a trade‐off in antiviral specificity, as variants exhibiting enhanced activity against HIV‐1 poorly restrict influenza A virus. Overall, we provide the first experimental evidence that diversification of IFITM3 genes may boost the antiviral coverage of host cells and provide selective functional advantages.

Development and characterization of a continuous cell line (EL) from the liver of European eel Anguilla anguilla

In the present study, a new hepatic tissue‐origin cell line from European eel Anguilla anguilla has been developed and characterized. This cell line designated EL has been maintained in Leibovitz L‐15 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum over 72 months, and subcultured more than 90 times. The EL cell line consisted predominantly of fibroblast‐like cells, which could survive over 100 days in vitro, and could grow at 15–32°C. The optimum temperature for growth was 27°C. The chromosome analysis revealed a modal diploid karyotype of 2n = 38. The origin of this cell line was confirmed by the 18S recombinant (r)RNA sequencing. The susceptibility test indicated significant cytopathic effects in the EL cells with regard to the Rana grylio virus and the Herpesvirus anguillae. The viral replication was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and polymerase chain reaction analysis. Following poly (I:C) exposure, the expression levels of the immune‐related molecules interferon regulatory factor‐7 (irf7) and transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐β) were downregulated in EL cells, whereas the expression levels of the rf3 and the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) were upregulated. All four genes were significantly upregulated following inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These data suggested the application of EL cell line for viral identification, as well as for immunodiagnosis and pharmacological targeting.

Aspectos importantes de prevención del personal sanitario en los hospitales durante la epidemia del nuevo coronavirus 2019./ [Important aspects of prevention of health personnel in hospitals during the epidemic novel coronavirus 2019.]

Today, the novel coronavirus has spread widely throughout the world and poses new challenges to ensure the health and safety of health personnel. Because health personnel are at the frontlines in the fight against the novel coronavirus, which is one of the groups most affected and vulnerable during the pandemic, it is necessary to remind that the preventive measures adopted by health personnel are essential. Especially in emergency situations, essential measures must be taken to prevent occupational exposure during the novel coronavirus pandemic. Health professionals are working with great intensity and enormous social responsibility. In addition to the applause, they deserve more attention.

Biopsychopharmacosocial approach to assess impact of social distancing and isolation on mental health in older adults.

It is impossible to predict or comprehend the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The UK Government's advice for vulnerable people, including older adults, to move towards self-isolation and social distancing is likely to reduce rates of transmission, the risk of severe illness and the impact on the acute health services. Although justified and necessary, this process of isolation is likely to have a negative impact on the mental health of these vulnerable groups, especially older people. It will become increasingly important for community health professionals to assess subtle changes in older persons' mental health, as the duration of this period of isolation remains unclear. The biopsychopharmacosocial model provides one method of assessing mental health and planning health and social care needs. This article hopes to guide community health professionals through the specifics of this assessment model in relation to the growing COVID-19 pandemic.

Pulmonary embolism: A complication of COVID 19 infection

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) has been reported in almost every country in the world. Although a large proportion of infected individuals develop only mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, the spectrum of the disease among others has been widely variable in severity. Besides, many infected individuals were found to have coagulation markers abnormalities, especially true among those progressing to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure. While the incidence of venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease has been recently noted to be elevated among critically ill patients, the incidence among ambulatory and non-critically ill patients is not yet clearly defined. Herein, we present six patients who didn't have any hypercoagulable risk factors yet presented with pulmonary embolism in association with COVID 19 infection. Furthermore, we discuss the possible underlying mechanisms of hypercoagulability and highlight the possibility of underdiagnosing pulmonary embolism in the setting of overlapping symptoms, decreased utilization of imaging secondary to associated risks, and increased turnover times. In addition, we emphasize the role of extended thromboprophylaxis in discharged patients.

Occurrence of viruses in human stools in the Ahaggar (Alberia).

From October 1977 to May 1980, 243 stools collected in sedentary and semi-nomadic populations of the Ahaggar (Algerian Sahara) were examined using immunoelectronmicroscopy and tissue culture inoculation. Immunoelectronmicroscopy revealed the presence of rotaviruses in 8, coronaviruses in 26, adenoviruses in 5 and small round viruses in 4. Enteroviruses were isolated in tissue culture from 24 stools. Rotaviruses were present in the Ahaggar but were associated with little acute enteric disease. The high frequency of coronaviruses both in gastroenteritis patients and in patients without disease was surprising. The prevalence of enteroviruses in this hyperarid zone was similar to or higher than that found in noticeably more human countries. Further systematic bacterial, viral and parasitic examinations are required to clarify the role of the above viruses in the aetiology of gastroenteritis in this region.

American College of Chest Physicians and Society of Thoracic Surgeons consensus statement for evaluation and management for high-risk patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer.

BACKGROUND The standard treatment of stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is lobectomy with systematic mediastinal lymph node evaluation. Unfortunately, up to 25% of patients with stage I NSCLC are not candidates for lobectomy because of severe medical comorbidity. METHODS A panel of experts was convened through the Thoracic Oncology Network of the American College of Chest Physicians and the Workforce on Evidence-Based Surgery of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Following a literature review, the panel developed 13 suggestions for evaluation and treatment through iterative discussion and debate until unanimous agreement was achieved. RESULTS Pretreatment evaluation should focus primarily on measures of cardiopulmonary physiology, as respiratory failure represents the greatest interventional risk. Alternative treatment options to lobectomy for high-risk patients include sublobar resection with or without brachytherapy, stereotactic body radiation therapy, and radiofrequency ablation. Each is associated with decreased procedural morbidity and mortality but increased risk for involved lobe and regional recurrence compared with lobectomy, but direct comparisons between modalities are lacking. CONCLUSIONS Therapeutic options for the treatment of high-risk patients are evolving quickly. Improved radiographic staging and the diagnosis of smaller and more indolent tumors push the risk-benefit decision toward parenchymal-sparing or nonoperative therapies in high-risk patients. Unbiased assessment of treatment options requires uniform reporting of treatment populations and outcomes in clinical series, which has been lacking to date.

Results from a long-term open-label extension study of adjunctive buprenorphine/samidorphan combination in patients with major depressive disorder.

Buprenorphine/samidorphan (BUP/SAM; ALKS 5461) is an investigational opioid system modulator for the adjunctive treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), who did not respond adequately to prior antidepressant therapy (ADT). FORWARD-2, an open-label extension study, assessed long-term safety and tolerability of adjunctive BUP/SAM treatment in these patients. Patients from four short-term trials and de novo patients were enrolled; all had confirmed MDD and a current major depressive episode lasting 2-24 months. Patients were treated with an established ADT for ≥8 weeks before receiving sublingual, adjunctive BUP/SAM 2/2 mg for up to 52 weeks. Safety (primary objective) was assessed via adverse events (AEs), the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale, and the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS). Exploratory evaluation of efficacy was done using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Of 1485 patients, 50% completed the study and 11% discontinued due to AEs. AEs of nausea, headache, constipation, dizziness, and somnolence, each occurred in ≥10% of patients. There was no evidence of increased suicidal ideation or behavior. Euphoria-related AEs were uncommon (1.2%). Following abrupt BUP/SAM discontinuation, "drug withdrawal" AEs were infrequent (0.4%), and the incidence of COWS categorical worsening after abrupt drug discontinuation was low (6.5%). Improvements in mean MADRS scores were maintained until study end, suggesting durability of antidepressant effect in patients continuing treatment. BUP/SAM was generally well tolerated, with a low risk of abuse and an AE profile consistent with those seen in placebo-controlled studies. Withdrawal reports were uncommon and of limited clinical impact.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of antibody in volunteers experimentally infected with human coronavirus strain 229 E.

An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed for detecting antibody rises to human coronavirus strain 229E and related strains in paired sera from infected volunteers. There was a close correlation between development of colds infected volunteers. There was a close correlation between development of colds and significant antibody rises detected by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, the assay was more sensitive than a neutralization assay. This enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is an easy, accurate, and sensitive assay for measuring significant antibody rises to human coronavirus strain 229E group viruses, and it could be useful in the clinical diagnosis of these infections.

Enterprise Architectures in E-Governments Studies: Why, What and How?

Enterprise Architecture (EA) is an important tool when developing e-governments and smart cities as it can help improve the alignment between business goals and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) implementations. Although some studies have been performed to study the applications of EA in public sectors, governments, and cities, most of such studies are scattered and there is no strong research stream. As a result, it is difficult to effectively accumulate relevant knowledge and experiences. In this research, we attempt to explore research streams and trends by analyzing why existing studies were conducted, what outcomes were produced, and what methods were used in these studies. Starting from these three questions, a thematic framework was developed, and a literature synthesis was presented. The result shows the complexity of this area, the importance of balancing technical factors and non-technical factors, the challenges brought by non-functional requirements. Despite the importance of EA frameworks, few studies have been found in which government or city relevant requirements were addressed in a general way. Such findings are expected to provide useful insights for possible future research in this area.

Genome Sequence of Peacock Reveals the Peculiar Case of a Glittering Bird

The unique ornamental features and extreme sexual traits of Peacock have always intrigued scientists and naturalists for centuries. However, the genomic basis of these phenotypes are yet unknown. Here, we report the first genome sequence and comparative analysis of peacock with the high quality genomes of chicken, turkey, duck, flycatcher and zebra finch. Genes involved in early developmental pathways including TGF-β, BMP, and Wnt signaling, which have been shown to be involved in feather patterning, bone morphogenesis, and skeletal muscle development, revealed signs of adaptive evolution and provided useful clues on the phenotypes of peacock. Innate and adaptive immune genes involved in complement system and T-cell response also showed signs of adaptive evolution in peacock suggesting their possible role in building a robust immune system which is consistent with the predictions of the Hamilton–Zuk hypothesis. This study provides novel genomic and evolutionary insights into the molecular understanding toward the phenotypic evolution of Indian peacock.

Preoperative cerebral oxygen saturation and clinical outcomes in cardiac surgery.

BACKGROUND The current study was designed to determine the relation between preoperative cerebral oxygen saturation (Sco2), variables of cardiopulmonary function, mortality, and morbidity in a heterogeneous cohort of cardiac surgery patients. METHODS In this study, 1,178 consecutive patients scheduled for on-pump surgery were prospectively studied. Preoperative Sco2, demographics, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitive troponin T, clinical outcomes, and 30-day and 1-yr mortality were recorded. RESULTS Median additive EuroSCORE was 5 (range: 0-19). Thirty-day and 1-yr mortality and major morbidity (at least two major complications and/or a high-dependency unit stay of at least 10 days) were 3.5%, 7.7%, and 13.3%, respectively. Median minimal preoperative oxygen supplemented Sco2 (Sco2min-ox) was 64% (range: 15-92%). Sco2min-ox was correlated (all: P value <0.0001) with N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (ρ: -0.35), high-sensitive troponin T (ρ: -0.28), hematocrit (ρ: 0.34), glomerular filtration rate (ρ: 0.19), EuroSCORE (τ: 0.20), and left ventricular ejection fraction class (τ: 0.12). Thirty-day nonsurvivors had a lower Sco2min-ox than survivors (median 58% [95% CI, 50.7-62%] vs. 64% [95% CI, 64-65%]; P < 0.0001). Receiver-operating curve analysis of Sco2min-ox and 30-day mortality revealed an area-under-the-curve of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.68-0.73%; P < 0.0001) in the total cohort and an area-under-the-curve of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.69-0.86%; P < 0.0001) in patients with a EuroSCORE more than 10. Logistic regression based on different EuroSCORE categories (0-2; 3-5, 6-10, >10), Sco2min-ox, and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass showed that a Sco2min-ox equal or less than 50% is an independent risk factor for 30-day and 1-yr mortality. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative Sco2 levels are reflective of the severity of cardiopulmonary dysfunction, associated with short- and long-term mortality and morbidity, and may add to preoperative risk stratification in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

Incidence of respiratory pathogens in persons hospitalized with pneumonia in two provinces in Thailand.

Although pneumonia is a leading cause of death from infectious disease worldwide, comprehensive information about its causes and incidence in low- and middle-income countries is lacking. Active surveillance of hospitalized patients with pneumonia is ongoing in Thailand. Consenting patients are tested for seven bacterial and 14 viral respiratory pathogens by PCR and viral culture on nasopharyngeal swab specimens, serology on acute/convalescent sera, sputum smears and antigen detection tests on urine. Between September 2003 and December 2005, there were 1730 episodes of radiographically confirmed pneumonia (34·6% in children aged <5 years); 66 patients (3·8%) died. A recognized pathogen was identified in 42·5% of episodes. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection was associated with 16·7% of all pneumonias, 41·2% in children. The viral pathogen with the highest incidence in children aged <5 years was RSV (417·1/100,000 per year) and in persons aged ≥50 years, influenza virus A (38·8/100,000 per year). These data can help guide health policy towards effective prevention strategies.

Burkholderia mallei CLH001 Attenuated Vaccine Strain Is Immunogenic and Protects against Acute Respiratory Glanders.

Burkholderia mallei is the causative agent of glanders, an incapacitating disease with high mortality rates in respiratory cases. Its endemicity and ineffective treatment options emphasize its public health threat and highlight the need for a vaccine. Live attenuated vaccines are considered the most viable vaccine strategy for Burkholderia, but single-gene-deletion mutants have not provided complete protection. In this study, we constructed the select-agent-excluded B. mallei ΔtonB Δhcp1 (CLH001) vaccine strain and investigated its ability to protect against acute respiratory glanders. Here we show that CLH001 is attenuated, safe, and effective at protecting against lethal B. mallei challenge. Intranasal administration of CLH001 to BALB/c and NOD SCID gamma (NSG) mice resulted in complete survival without detectable colonization or abnormal organ histopathology. Additionally, BALB/c mice intranasally immunized with CLH001 in a prime/boost regimen were fully protected against lethal challenge with the B. mallei lux (CSM001) wild-type strain.

Transabdominal ultrasound for pregnancy diagnosis in Reeves' muntjac deer.

Reeves' muntjac deer (Muntiacus reevesi) are a small cervid species native to southeast Asia, and are currently being investigated as a potential model of prion disease transmission and pathogenesis. Vertical transmission is an area of interest among researchers studying infectious diseases, including prion disease, and these investigations require efficient methods for evaluating the effects of maternal infection on reproductive performance. Ultrasonographic examination is a well-established tool for diagnosing pregnancy and assessing fetal health in many animal species(1-7), including several species of farmed cervids(8-19), however this technique has not been described in Reeves' muntjac deer. Here we describe the application of transabdominal ultrasound to detect pregnancy in muntjac does and to evaluate fetal growth and development throughout the gestational period. Using this procedure, pregnant animals were identified as early as 35 days following doe-buck pairing and this was an effective means to safely monitor the pregnancy at regular intervals. Future goals of this work will include establishing normal fetal measurement references for estimation of gestational age, determining sensitivity and specificity of the technique for diagnosing pregnancy at various stages of gestation, and identifying variations in fetal growth and development under different experimental conditions.

Iranian Emergency Medical Service Response in Disaster; Report of three Earthquakes

INTRODUCTION: The earthquake is one of the most natural catastrophic crises that can cause a lot of casualties. Considering an earthquake-prone country, Iran is ranked as one of the world's most dangerous countries OBJECTIVE: In this article, we describe the actions taken by emergency medical service (EMS) after the earthquake in Kermanshah, Varzaghan, and Bam and compared the strengths and weaknesses of the emergency response program and the limitations and challenges of this system in dealing with these major crises. METHOD: This study is a cross-sectional study that compares some of the information and findings related to three earthquakes that occurred in Iran, including Bam, Varzaghan and Sarpol-e-Zahab earthquakes. The data reported in the present article is descriptive and is based on various independent sources such as National Emergency Operation Center, Local Emergency Operations Center (EOC), the EMS of the country, the World Health Organization, the United Nations, the statistics website, the Forensic Data website, the International Institute of Seismology and Earthquake Engineering, conferences and personal interviews. To ensure the credibility of the information, the authors reported data that had been verified by two or more sources. RESULTS: The characteristics of the geographic area of the 3 earthquakes has been described. Post-earthquake response activities were described in details in subheadings including rapid warning and response, surge capacity plan, rapid response teams, emergency medical teams, increasing the capacity of health facilities, increasing transfer capacity, and handling, transportation and distribution of injuries. CONCLUSION: In the recent earthquake, had been occurred in Sarpol-e-Zahab, the health response of the country was largely satisfactory. The existence of structures such as EOC at various levels, the unified incident command system, emergency operations plan, and Medical Care Monitoring Center are among the most important reasons for satisfactory performance.

Assessment of Age-Related Decline of Immunological Function and Possible Methods for Immunological Restoration in Elderly

The immune system plays an important role in protection against infection and cancer, and in the maintenance of the internal environment of the body. However, such important immune functions are known to decline with age in many mammals, including humans. It is a matter of clinical importance that the incidence of various age-associated diseases such as infections, cancer, and vascular disorders increases with a decrease in immunological vigor. The extent of immunologic decline is variable and exhibits wide interindividual variations. Thus, it is important to assess the extent of immunologic decline in both patients suffering from various diseases and in healthy people in order to maintain healthy conditions. To this end, we have developed a scoring system that analyzes immune parameters according to a database of known age-associated immune changes obtained from a healthy population. Using this scoring system, we can combine several different immunological parameters and express the immune status of individuals as a simple numeral. Several methods of immunological restoration were introduced and the magnitude of restoration was evaluated by the quantitative assessment of immunological level.

In vitro comparison between inspiration synchronized and continuous vibrating mesh nebulizer during trans-nasal aerosol delivery

BACKGROUND: Compared to continuous vibrating mesh nebulizer (VMN), inspiration synchronized VMN has shown increased inhaled dose during noninvasive ventilation; however, its use during aerosol delivery via high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is still unknown. METHODS: An adult manikin was connected to a dual-chamber model lung, which was driven by a critical care ventilator to simulate spontaneous breathing. A HFNC system was utilized with temperature at 37 ° C while gas flow at 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 L/min. Inspiration synchronized and continuous aerosol generation were compared at different positions (at the inlet of humidifier vs close to patient). One milliliter of albuterol (2.5 mg/mL) was used in each run (n = 3). Collection filter was placed at the trachea and was removed after each run. Drug was eluted from the filter and assayed with UV spectrophotometry (276 nm). RESULTS: When nebulizer was placed close to patient, inhaled dose was higher with inspiration synchronized than continuous aerosol generation at all gas flows (p = 0.05) except at 5 L/min. When placed at the inlet of humidifier, compared to continuous, inspiration synchronized aerosol generated higher inhaled dose with gas flow set below 50% of patient inspiratory flow [23.9 (20.6, 28.3)% vs 18.1 (16.7, 19.6)%, p < 0.001], but lower inhaled dose with gas flow set above 50% of patient inspiratory flow [3.5 (2.2, 9.3)% vs 9.9 (8.2, 16.4)%, p = 0.001]. Regardless of breathing pattern, continuous aerosol delivered greater inhaled dose with nebulizer placed at humidifier than close to patient at all gas flows except at 5 L/min. CONCLUSION: When the HFNC gas flow was set higher than 50% of patient inspiratory flow, no significant advantage was found in inspiration synchronized over continuous aerosol. However, inspiration synchronized aerosol generated 30% more inhaled dose than continuous with gas flow set below 50% of patient inspiratory flow, regardless of nebulizer placement. Continuous nebulizer needs to be placed at the inlet of humidifier.

Metagenomic sequencing with spiked primer enrichment for viral diagnostics and genomic surveillance

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), the shotgun sequencing of RNA and DNA from clinical samples, has proved useful for broad-spectrum pathogen detection and the genomic surveillance of viral outbreaks. An additional target enrichment step is generally needed for high-sensitivity pathogen identification in low-titre infections, yet available methods using PCR or capture probes can be limited by high cost, narrow scope of detection, lengthy protocols and/or cross-contamination. Here, we developed metagenomic sequencing with spiked primer enrichment (MSSPE), a method for enriching targeted RNA viral sequences while simultaneously retaining metagenomic sensitivity for other pathogens. We evaluated MSSPE for 14 different viruses, yielding a median tenfold enrichment and mean 47% (±16%) increase in the breadth of genome coverage over mNGS alone. Virus detection using MSSPE arboviral or haemorrhagic fever viral panels was comparable in sensitivity to specific PCR, demonstrating 95% accuracy for the detection of Zika, Ebola, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses in plasma samples from infected patients. Notably, sequences from re-emerging and/or co-infecting viruses that have not been specifically targeted a priori, including Powassan and Usutu, were successfully enriched using MSSPE. MSSPE is simple, low cost, fast and deployable on either benchtop or portable nanopore sequencers, making this method directly applicable for diagnostic laboratory and field use.

Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors Usage is Associated with Improved Inflammatory Status and Clinical Outcomes in COVID-19 Patients With Hypertension

With the capability of inducing elevated expression of ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin II receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ARBs/ACEIs) treatment may have a controversial role in both facilitating virus infection and reducing pathogenic inflammation. We aimed to evaluate the correlation of ARBs/ACEIs usage with the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in a retrospective, single-center study. 126 COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (HPHTCM) in Wuhan from January 5 to February 22, 2020 were retrospectively allocated to ARBs/ACEIs group (n=43) and non-ARBs/ACEIs group (n=83) according to their antihypertensive medication. 125 age- and sex-matched COVID-19 patients without hypertension were randomly selected as non-hypertension controls. In addition, the medication history of 1942 hypertension patients that were admitted to HPHTCM from November 1 to December 31, 2019 before COVID-19 outbreak were also reviewed for external comparison. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected, analyzed and compared between these groups. The frequency of ARBs/ACEIs usage in hypertension patients with or without COVID-19 were comparable. Among COVID-19 patients with hypertension, those received either ARBs/ACEIs or non-ARBs/ACEIs had comparable blood pressure. However, ARBs/ACEIs group had significantly lower concentrations of CRP (p=0.049) and procalcitonin (PCT, p=0.008). Furthermore, much lower proportion of critical patients (9.3% vs 22.9%; p=0.061), and a lower death rate (4.7% vs 13.3%; p=0.216) were observed in ARBs/ACEIs group than non-ARBs/ACEIs group, although these differences failed to reach statistical significance. Our findings thus support the use of ARBs/ACEIs in COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension.

Adjusting to the new reality: Evaluation of early practice pattern adaptations to the COVID-19 pandemic

OBJECTIVE: We aim to define national practice patterns to assess current clinical practice, anticipated delays and areas of concern that potentially could lead to deviations from the normal standard of care. METHODS: Anonymous surveys were emailed to members of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO). The spread of COVID-19 and its impact on gynecologic oncology care in terms of alterations to normal treatment patterns and anticipated challenges were assessed. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed to determine risk factors for COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: We analyzed the responses of 331 gynecologic oncology providers. COVID-19 is present in 99.1% of surveyed communities with 99.7% reporting mitigation efforts in effect. The infection rate differs significantly between regions (pâª0.001) with the Northeast reporting the highest number of COVID-19 cases. Practice volume has dropped by 61.6% since the start of the pandemic with most cancellations being provider initiated. A majority of responders (52.8%) believed that ovarian cancer will be the most affected cancer by COVID-19. >94% of responders are proceeding with gynecologic cancer surgeries with exception of grade 1, endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma (36.3%). Surgical backlog (58.6%), delayed cancer diagnosis (43.2%) and re-establishing normal care with delayed patient (37.8%) were identified as the top 3 challenges after COVID-19 has abated. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is widespread and has radically altered normal practice patterns. Despite COVID-19 related concerns, most gynecologic oncology care is proceeding. However, the steep decline in clinical volume shows there is a large group of patients who are not being diagnosed or are deferring care.

Modified Graded Repair of Cerebrospinal Fluid Leaks in Endoscopic Endonasal Transsphenoidal Surgery.

OBJECTIVE Complete sellar floor reconstruction is critical to avoid postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage during transsphenoidal surgery. Recently, the pedicled nasoseptal flap has undergone many modifications and eventually proved to be valuable and efficient. However, using these nasoseptal flaps in all patients who undergo transsphenoidal surgery, including those who had none or only minor CSF leakage, appears to be overly invasive and time-consuming. METHODS Patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal tumor surgery within a 5 year-period were reviewed. Since 2009, we classified the intraoperative CSF leakage into grades from 0 to 3. Sellar floor reconstruction was tailored to each leak grade. We did not use any tissue grafts such as abdominal fat and did not include any procedures of CSF diversions such as lumbar drainage. RESULTS Among 200 cases in 188 patients (147 pituitary adenoma and 41 other pathologies), intraoperative CSF leakage was observed in 27.4% of 197 cases : 14.7% Grade 1, 4.6% Grade 2a, 3.0% Grade 2b, and 5.1% Grade 3. Postoperative CSF leakage was observed in none of the cases. Septal bone buttress was used for Grade 1 to 3 leakages instead of any other foreign materials. Pedicled nasoseptal flap was used for Grades 2b and 3 leakages. Unused septal bones and nasoseptal flaps were repositioned. CONCLUSION Modified classification of intraoperative CSF leaks and tailored repair technique in a multilayered fashion using an en-bloc harvested septal bone and vascularized nasoseptal flaps is an effective and reliable method for the prevention of postoperative CSF leaks.

The 2003 SARS outbreak and its impact on infection control practices

Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) emerged recently as a new infectious disease that was transmitted efficiently in the healthcare setting and particularly affected healthcare workers (HCWs), patients and visitors. The efficiency of transmission within healthcare facilities was recognised following significant hospital outbreaks of SARS in Canada, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam. The causative agent of SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus, the SARS coronavirus. This was largely spread by direct or indirect contact with large respiratory droplets, although airborne transmission has also been reported. High infection rates among HCWs led initially to the theory that SARS was highly contagious and the concept of ‘super-spreading events’. Such events illustrated that lack of infection control (IC) measures or failure to comply with IC precautions could lead to large-scale hospital outbreaks. SARS was eventually contained by the stringent application of IC measures that limited exposure of HCWs to potentially infectious individuals. As the ‘global village’ becomes smaller and other microbial threats to health emerge, or re-emerge, there is an urgent need to develop a global strategy for infection control in hospitals. This paper provides an overview of the main IC practices employed during the 2003 SARS outbreak, including management measures, dedicated SARS hospitals, personal protective equipment, isolation, handwashing, environmental decontamination, education and training. The psychological and psychosocial impact on HCWs during the outbreak are also discussed. Requirements for IC programmes in the post-SARS period are proposed based on the major lessons learnt from the SARS outbreak.

Infection control in the management of highly pathogenic infectious diseases: consensus of the European Network of Infectious Disease

Summary The European Network for Infectious Diseases (EUNID) is a network of clinicians, public health epidemiologists, microbiologists, infection control, and critical-care doctors from the European member states, who are experienced in the management of patients with highly infectious diseases. We aim to develop a consensus recommendation for infection control during clinical management and invasive procedures in such patients. After an extensive literature review, draft recommendations were amended jointly by 27 partners from 15 European countries. Recommendations include repetitive training of staff to ascertain infection control, systematic use of cough and respiratory etiquette at admission to the emergency department, fluid sampling in the isolation room, and analyses in biosafety level 3/4 laboratories, and preference for point-of-care bedside laboratory tests. Children should be cared for by paediatricians and intensive-care patients should be cared for by critical-care doctors in high-level isolation units (HLIU). Invasive procedures should be avoided if unnecessary or done in the HLIU, as should chest radiography, ultrasonography, and renal dialysis. Procedures that require transport of patients out of the HLIU should be done during designated sessions or hours in secure transport. Picture archiving and communication systems should be used. Post-mortem examination should be avoided; biopsy or blood collection is preferred.

Burn center function during the COVID-19 pandemic: An international multi-center report of strategy and experience

The novel coronavirus, SARS-CO V2 responsible for COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly escalating across the globe. Burn centers gearing for the pandemic must strike a balance between contributing to the pandemic response and preserving ongoing burn care in a safe and ethical fashion. The authors of the present communication represent seven burn centers from China, Singapore, Japan, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US). Each center is located at a different point along the pandemic curve and serves different patient populations within their healthcare systems. We review our experience with the virus to date, our strategic approach to burn center function under these circumstances, and lessons learned. The purpose of this communication is to share experiences that will assist with continued preparations to help burn centers advocate for optimum burn care and overcome challenges as this pandemic continues.

An Overview of Brevinin Superfamily: Structure, Function and Clinical Perspectives

Antimicrobial peptides are the backbone of first-line defense against various microorganisms in the animal kingdom. Thus, not surprisingly, they are gaining attention in the science and medical fields as a rich repository of new pro-drugs. Below, we focus our attention on the Brevinin family of anuran peptides. While most of them show strong antibacterial activities, some, e.g. Brevinin-2R, appear to be promising anticancer molecules, exhibiting better a therapeutic window than widely-use anticancer drugs like doxorubicin. We briefly introduce the field, followed by highlighting the promising therapeutic properties of Brevinins. Next, we provide information about the cloning and phylogenetic aspects of Brevinin genes. In the final paragraphs of this chapter, we discuss possible large-scale production methods of Brevinins, giving examples of some systems that are already in use. Towards the end, we discuss various means of modification of biologic properties of Brevinins, either by chemical modifications or by amino acid substitution and sequence rearrangements. In this context, also other unique properties of Brevinins are briefly mentioned. Finally, we discuss the future of the Brevinin field, particularly highlighting yet to be answered biologic questions, like for example presumed anti-viral and antitumor activities of Brevinin family members.

Impact of isoproterenol infusion on BIS and metabolic values in pediatric patients undergoing electrophysiology studies.

STUDY OBJECTIVE To study changes in BIS values and metabolic parameters during an infusion of isoproterenol in pediatric patients. DESIGN Retrospective study approved By Committee For The Protection Of Human Subjects at University Of Texas Medical School at Houston. SETTING University-affiliated children's hospital. MEASUREMENTS The records of pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia for electrophysiology procedures were analyzed. Electronic data collected included Bispectral Index (BIS) values, anesthetics (eg, opioids, expired concentration of inhaled anesthetics, muscle relaxants), hemodynamic values (ie, heart rate, invasive blood pressure), respiratory parameters [ie, tidal volume, respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2)], and routine arterial blood gases. These parameters were analyzed 10 minutes prior to the start of the isoproterenol infusion (T-pre) and 10 minutes after isoproterenol had reduced the cardiac cycle length by 20% (T-infusion). MAIN RESULTS Of the 29 records that were screened, 22 met the above criteria (mean age 13 ± 5 yrs). BIS values increased by an average of 8 (33 ± 8 to 41 ± 10; P < 0.001) during the isoproterenol infusion. Statistically significant increases in ETCO2 (median 33 - 36 mmHg; P = 0.01), PaCO2 (35 - 38 mmHg; P = 0.002), and lactate (1.1 -1.5 mg/dL; P < 0.001) occurred with infusion of isoproterenol. Patients undergoing controlled mechanical ventilation showed an increase in ETCO2 (mean 34 ± 6 mmHg to 37 ± 5 mmHg; P = 0.001) whereas those breathing spontaneously had an increase in minute ventilation (average increase 111 ± 30 mL/kg). CONCLUSIONS Isoproterenol increases metabolic, respiratory, and BIS values in pediatric patients during general anesthesia. We recommend the use of BIS, close monitoring of ETCO2, and careful titration of anesthetics during isoproterenol infusion, especially when lighter planes of general anesthesia are requested for pediatric electrophysiologic procedures.

Sample-to-result molecular infectious disease assays: clinical implications, limitations and potential

Molecular infectious disease diagnostic tests have undergone major advances in the past decade and will continue to rapidly evolve. Assays have become extraordinarily simple to perform, eliminating the need for pre-analytic sample preparation and post-amplification analysis. This allows these tests to be performed in settings without sophisticated expertise in molecular biology, including locations with limited resources. Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity of these assays is superb and many offer extremely fast turn-around times. These tests have major impacts on patient care, but also have some limitations.

Characterization of a temperature sensitive feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus

The characteristics of a temperature sensitive feline infectious peritonitis virus (TS-FIPV) were examined. TS-FIPV, unlike its parent strain, DF2 wild type FIPV (WT-FIPV), propagated at 31 °C (permissive temperature) but not at 39 °C (nonpermissive temperature). This temperature preference of TS-FIPV was also demonstrated in cats by the ability of the virus to replicate only at the lower temperature in the upper respiratory tract and not at systemic sites where higher temperatures (38–39 °C) prevail. Viral structural proteins and RNA were synthesized at 39 °C but some undefined maturational defect prevented the formation of infectious TS-FIPV at its nonpermissive temperature. TS-FIPV was more thermolabile than WT-FIPV which indicated alterations in the structural proteins of TS-FIPV, and a difference in the envelope protein of the two viruses was revealed by Western blot analysis. Plaque assay characterization showed that TS-FIPV produced small plaques in comparison to the large plaques of WT-FIPV. These unique characteristics possessed by TS-FIPV may account for its nonvirulent nature and ability to stimulate protective immune responses in cats.

Endovascular treatment of fusiform cerebral aneurysms with the Pipeline Embolization Device.

OBJECT Despite advances in surgical and endovascular techniques, fusiform aneurysms remain a therapeutic challenge. Introduction of flow-diverting stents has revolutionized the treatment of aneurysms with wide necks and of complex morphology. The authors report their experience with the endovascular treatment of fusiform aneurysms using the Pipeline Embolization Device. METHODS A retrospective review of 146 patients with cerebral aneurysms treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device between June 2011 and January 2013 was performed. Twenty-four patients were identified as having fusiform aneurysms. Twenty-four aneurysms in these 24 patients were treated. The mean patient age was 59 years. There were 9 men and 15 women. Angiographic and clinical data (including the modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score) were recorded at the time of treatment and at follow-up. The aneurysms were located in the internal carotid artery in 8 patients (33.3%), middle cerebral artery in 8 patients (33.3%), anterior cerebral artery in 1 patient (4%), and vertebrobasilar circulation in 7 patients (29%). The aneurysms were smaller than 10 mm in 3 patients, 10-25 mm in 16 patients, and larger than 25 mm in 5 patients. The mean largest dimension diameter was 18 mm. RESULTS Stent deployment was successful in all cases. The minor procedural morbidity was 4% (1 case). Morbidity and mortality related to aneurysm treatment were 4.2% and 4.2%, respectively. The mean mRS scores preoperatively and at clinical follow-up (median 6.0 months, mean 6.9 months) were 0.71 and 1.2, respectively (91.7% presented with an mRS score of 2 or better, and 79.2% had an mRS score of 2 or better at the 6.0-month follow-up). At clinical follow-up, 82.6% of patients were stable or had improved, 13.0% worsened, and 4.2% had died. Twenty-two (91.7%) of 24 patients had follow-up angiography available (mean follow-up time 6.3 months); 59% had excellent angiographic results (> 95% or complete occlusion), 31.8% had complete aneurysm occlusion, 27.3% had greater than 95% aneurysm occlusion, 18.2% had a moderate decrease in size (50%-95%), 4.5% had a minimal decrease in size (< 50%), 13.6% had not changed, and 4.5% had an increase in size. CONCLUSIONS This series demonstrates that endovascular treatment of fusiform cerebral aneurysms with flow diversion was a safe and effective treatment. Procedural complications were low. Long-term morbidity and mortality rates were acceptable given the complex nature of these lesions.

What Can We Estimate from Fatality and Infectious Case Data using the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model? A case Study of Covid-19 Pandemic

The rapidly spreading Covid-19 that affected almost all countries, was first reported at the end of 2019. As a consequence of its highly infectious nature, countries all over the world have imposed extremely strict measures to control its spread. Since the earliest stages of this major pandemic, academics have done a huge amount of research in order to understand the disease, develop medication, vaccines and tests, and model its spread. Among these studies, a great deal of effort has been invested in the estimation of epidemic parameters in the early stage, for the countries affected by Covid-19, hence to predict the course of the epidemic but the variability of the controls over the course of the epidemic complicated the modeling processes. In this article, the determination of the basic reproduction number, the mean duration of the infectious period, the estimation of the timing of the peak of the epidemic wave is discussed using early phase data. Daily case reports and daily fatalities for ten countries over the period January 22, 2020 - April 18, 2020 are evaluated using the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. For each country, the SIR models fitting cumulative infective case data within 5% error are analysed. It is observed that the basic reproduction number and the mean duration of the infectious period can be estimated only in cases where the spread of the epidemic is over (for China and South Korea in the present case). Nevertheless, it is shown that the timing of the maximum and timings of the inflection points of the proportion of infected individuals can be robustly estimated from the normalized data. The validation of the estimates by comparing the predictions with actual data has shown that the predictions were realised for all countries except USA, as long as lock-down measures were retained.

Clinical practice guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a review and comparison of current resources.

The first clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the assessment and management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were published 30 years ago. These and subsequent CPGs issued by professional societies and other groups prior to 2000 were consensus recommendations based on expert opinion and available studies, and they have been criticized for being inconsistent and not explicitly evidence-based. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), a joint project of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, released the first of a new generation of rigorous, evidence-based COPD guidelines in 2001. Since that time several other CPGs, notably those developed jointly by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), and by the British National Collaborating Center for Chronic Conditions and Institute for Clinical Excellence, have also become available. While previous COPD guidelines had different severity-grading systems and differed in their therapy recommendations, the new CPGs are remarkably consistent and have very few areas of clinically relevant discrepancy. All are available free via the Internet, provide for regular revision and updating, and include materials for patients and the public, as well as for health-care providers. Although the GOLD and ATS-ERS guidelines both have international authorship and are intended for worldwide use, implementation of many of their recommendations (such as the requirement for spirometry in diagnosis and staging, an escalating management scheme that includes expensive inhaled medications and pulmonary rehabilitation, and consideration for lung-volume reduction surgery) remains beyond the reach of many patients and health care systems.

Epidemiology and clinical course of COVID-19 in Shanghai, China.

Background Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is prevalent around the world. We aimed to describe epidemiological features and clinical course in a large urban center to inform prevention and treatment of imported epidemics. Methods We retrospectively analyzed data collected at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, between January 20 and February 29, 2020. Results Among 325 cases admitted, median age was 51 years and 47.4% (154/325) had visited Wuhan within 2 weeks of illness onset. Most cases (57.2%) occurred in 67 clusters; 40% were situated within 53 family clusters. 83.7% developed fever during the disease course. Median times from onset to negative detection of nucleic acid by nasopharyngeal swab, first medical care and hospitalization were 8, 1 and 4 days. Longer duration of viral shedding in blood and feces was detected among patients with mild disease using glucocorticoid. Comorbidities were present in 28.9% of cases. At admission, 69.8% presented with lymphopenia and 38.8% had elevated D-dimers. Pneumonia was identified in 97.5% (314/322) of cases by chest CT scan; 42.9% had bilateral lung involvement. Severe-critical patients were 8% with a median time from onset to critical disease of 10.5 days. Half required oxygen therapy and 7.1% high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO); median time from onset to oxygen therapy and HFNO was 7 and 9 days. The case fatality rate was 0.92% with median time from onset to death of 16 days. Conclusion COVID-19 cases in Shanghai were imported, presenting as viral pneumonia with half of cases needing oxygen therapy. Rapid identification, and effective control measures helped to contain the outbreak and prevent community transmission.

Dissimilar properties of two recombinant Lactobacillus acidophilus strains displaying Salmonella FliC with different anchoring motifs.

Display of heterologous antigens on the cell surface is considered a useful technique for vaccine delivery by recombinant lactobacilli. In this study, two recombinant Lactobacillus acidophilus derivatives displaying Salmonella flagellin (FliC) were constructed using different anchor motifs. In one instance, the FliC protein was fused to the C-terminal region of a cell envelope proteinase (PrtP) and was bound to the cell wall by electrostatic bonds. In the other case, the same antigen was conjugated to the anchor region of mucus binding protein (Mub) and was covalently associated with the cell wall by an LPXTG motif. These two recombinant L. acidophilus cell surface displays resulted in dissimilar maturation and cytokine production by human myeloid dendritic cells. The surface-associated antigen was highly sensitive to simulated gastric and small intestinal juices. By supplementation with bicarbonate buffer and soybean trypsin inhibitor, the cell surface antigen was protected from proteolytic enzymes during gastric challenge in vitro. The protective reagents also increased the viability of the L. acidophilus cells upon challenge with simulated digestive juices. These results demonstrate the importance of protecting cells and their surface-associated antigens during oral immunization.

COVID-19 and the US response: accelerating health inequities

Health inequities have long defined health and the healthcare system in the USA. The clinical and research capacity across the USA is unparalleled, yet compared to other high and even some middle-income countries, the average health indicators of the population remain suboptimal in 2020, a finding at least in part explained by inequity in healthcare access. In this context, COVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a major threat to the public's health. While it was initially thought that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 would be the great equaliser as it would not discriminate, it is clear that COVID-19 incidence and mortality have rapidly reinforced health disparities drawn by historical and contemporary inequities. Here, we synthesise the data highlighting specific risks among particular marginalised and under-resourced communities including those in jails, prisons and detention centers, immigrants and the undocumented, people with disabilities and people experiencing homelessness across the USA. The drivers of these disparities are pervasive structural risks including limited access to preventive services, inability to comply with physical distancing recommendations, underlying health disparities and intersecting stigmas particularly affecting racial and ethnic minorities across the country, including African Americans, Latinx Americans and Native Americans. Advancing the COVID-19 response, saving lives and restarting the economy necessitate rapidly addressing these inequities rather than ignoring and even reinforcing them.

Auscultation versus Point-of-care Ultrasound to Determine Endotracheal versus Bronchial Intubation: A Diagnostic Accuracy Study.

BACKGROUND Unrecognized malposition of the endotracheal tube (ETT) can lead to severe complications in patients under general anesthesia. The focus of this double-blinded randomized study was to assess the accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound in verifying the correct position of the ETT and to compare it with the accuracy of auscultation. METHODS Forty-two adult patients requiring general anesthesia with ETT were consented. Patients were randomized to right main bronchus, left main bronchus, or tracheal intubation. After randomization, the ETT was placed via fiber-optic visualization. Next, the location of the ETT was assessed using auscultation by a separate blinded anesthesiologist, followed by an ultrasound performed by a third blinded anesthesiologist. Ultrasound examination included assessment of tracheal dilation via cuff inflation with air and evaluation of pleural lung sliding. Statistical analysis included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and interobserver agreement for the ultrasound examination (95% CI). RESULTS In differentiating tracheal versus bronchial intubations, auscultation showed a sensitivity of 66% (0.39 to 0.87) and a specificity of 59% (0.39 to 0.77), whereas ultrasound showed a sensitivity of 93% (0.66 to 0.99) and specificity of 96% (0.79 to 1). Identification of tracheal versus bronchial intubation was 62% (26 of 42) in the auscultation group and 95% (40 of 42) in the ultrasound group (P = 0.0005) (CI for difference, 0.15 to 0.52), and the McNemar comparison showed statistically significant improvement with ultrasound (P < 0.0001). Interobserver agreement of ultrasound findings was 100%. CONCLUSION Assessment of trachea and pleura via point-of-care ultrasound is superior to auscultation in determining the location of ETT.

The combination of decoy receptor 3 and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 for the diagnosis of nosocomial bacterial meningitis

BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment can significantly reduce mortality of nosocomial bacterial meningitis. However, it is a challenge for clinicians to make an accurate and rapid diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. This study aimed at determining whether combined biomarkers can provide a useful tool for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The patients with bacterial meningitis had significantly elevated levels of the above mentioned biomarkers. The two biomarkers were all risk factors with bacterial meningitis. The biomarkers were constructed into a “bioscore”. The discriminative performance of the bioscore was better than that of each biomarker, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.842 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.770–0.914; p< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Combined measurement of CSF DcR3 and sTREM-1 concentrations improved the prediction of nosocomial bacterial meningitis. The combined strategy is of interest and the validation of that improvement needs further studies.

Interventions to improve resilience in physicians who have completed training: A systematic review.

BACKGROUND Resilience is a contextual phenomenon where a complex and dynamic interplay exists between individual, environmental, and socio-cultural factors. With growing interest in enhancing resilience in physicians, given their high risk for experiencing prolonged or intense stress, effective strategies are necessary to improve resilience and reduce negative outcomes including burnout. The objective of this review was to identify effective interventions to improve resilience in physicians who have completed training, working in any setting. METHODS AND FINDINGS We included randomized controlled trials (RCT), and observational studies (including pilot studies) published in English, French, and Spanish that included an intervention to improve resilience in physicians who have completed training. We included studies that implemented interventions to reduce burnout, anxiety, and depression or to improve empathy to ultimately enhance resilience, rather than studies designed solely to reduce stress or trauma-induced stress. We performed a systematic search of Medline, EMBASE, PsychInfo, CINAHL and Cochrane Library with no publication year limit. The last search was conducted on March 29, 2017. We used random effect models to calculate pooled standardized mean differences. Resilience was the primary outcome measure using validated resilience scores. Secondary outcome measures included proxy measures of resilience such as burnout, empathy, anxiety and depression. Our search strategy identified 7,579 records;74 met the criteria for full-text review. Seventeen studies were included in the final review published between 1998 and 2016 of which 9 (4 RCT, 5 observational) had physician data extractable. Interventions varied greatly regarding their approach, duration, and follow-up. Two RCTs measured resilience using validated scales; both found a significant improvement. No meta-analysis for resilience was conducted due to the presence of high clinical and methodological heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS Our systematic review demonstrates that there is weak evidence to support one intervention over another to improve resilience in physicians who have completed training. The quality of evidence for the outcomes ranged from very low to low. There is a need for a consensus on the definition of resilience and how it is measured. Longer follow-up is required to ensure any intervention effects are sustained over time.

The Effect of Carotid Chemoreceptor Inhibition on Exercise Tolerance in Chronic Heart Failure.

Purpose Chronic heart failure (CHF) is characterized by heightened sympathetic nervous activity, carotid chemoreceptor (CC) sensitivity, marked exercise intolerance and an exaggerated ventilatory response to exercise. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of CC inhibition on exercise cardiovascular and ventilatory function, and exercise tolerance in health and CHF. Methods Twelve clinically stable, optimally treated patients with CHF (mean ejection fraction: 43 ± 2.5%) and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited. Participants completed two time-to-symptom-limitation (TLIM) constant load cycling exercise tests at 75% peak power output with either intravenous saline or low-dose dopamine (2 μg⋅kg-1⋅min-1; order randomized). Ventilation was measured using expired gas data and operating lung volume data were determined during exercise by inspiratory capacity maneuvers. Cardiac output was estimated using impedance cardiography, and vascular conductance was calculated as cardiac output/mean arterial pressure. Results There was no change in TLIM in either group with dopamine (CHF: saline 13.1 ± 2.4 vs. dopamine 13.5 ± 1.6 min, p = 0.78; Control: saline 10.3 ± 1.2 vs. dopamine 11.5 ± 1.3 min, p = 0.16). In CHF patients, dopamine increased cardiac output (p = 0.03), vascular conductance (p = 0.01) and oxygen delivery (p = 0.04) at TLIM, while ventilatory parameters were unaffected (p = 0.76). In controls, dopamine improved vascular conductance at TLIM (p = 0.03), but no other effects were observed. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the CC contributes to cardiovascular regulation during full-body exercise in patients with CHF, however, CC inhibition does not improve exercise tolerance.

Genetic and antigenic characterization of newly isolated bovine toroviruses from Japanese cattle.

Torovirus, a member of the Coronaviridae family, is a gastrointestinal infectious agent that has been identified in humans, cattle, pigs, and equines. Toroviruses, except equine torovirus, are difficult to propagate in cell culture; indeed, to date, only the Aichi/2004 strain of bovine torovirus (BToV) has been isolated among the human, bovine, and porcine toroviruses. In the present study, four cytopathogenic BToVs were isolated from diarrheal feces of the cattle using the HRT-18 cell line, and their genetic and antigenic properties were compared. The cytopathogenic features of BToV isolates in HRT-18 cells were similar to those of the Aichi/2004 strain. However, none of the isolates showed cytopathogenic effects in the HRT-18 cells of different origin, suggesting that one significant factor contributing to the cytopathogenicity of BToV depends on properties of the HRT-18 cells themselves. All BToVs isolated were able to agglutinate mouse, but not chicken, erythrocytes, while they lacked receptor-destroying enzyme activity. Analysis of the N terminus of the spike gene showed that three isolates, but not the Gifu-2007TI/E strain, were phylogenetically located in cluster 1 and its analogs and revealed high cross-reactivity with each other, as demonstrated by neutralization (NT) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. The Gifu-2007TI/E strain was classified close to cluster 2 and exhibited relatively low cross-reactivity with these viruses; however, the difference was not sufficient to classify BToVs into serotypes, suggesting that at least two subtypes distinguishable by the structure of the N terminus of the spike gene and that both NT and HI tests may be exist.

Pertussis in infants: an underestimated disease

BACKGROUND: The clinical diagnosis of pertussis is not easy in early infancy since clinical manifestations can overlap with several different diseases. Many cases are often misclassified and underdiagnosed. We conducted a retrospective study on infants to assess how often physicians suspected pertussis and the actual frequency of Bordetella pertussis infections. METHODS: We analyzed all infants with age ≤90 days hospitalized from March 2011 until September 2013 for acute respiratory symptoms tested with a Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction able to detect Bordetella pertussis and with a Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction for a multipanel respiratory virus. Therefore, we compared patients with pertussis positive aspirate, patients with respiratory virus positive aspirate and patients with negative aspirate to identify symptoms or clinical findings predictive of pertussis. RESULTS: Out of 215 patients analyzed, 53 were positive for pertussis (24.7 %), 119 were positive for respiratory virus (55.3 %) and 43 had a negative aspirate (20 %). Pertussis was suspected in 22 patients at admission and 16 of them were confirmed by laboratory tests, while 37 infants with different admission diagnosis resulted positive for pertussis. The sensitivity of clinical diagnosis was 30.2 % and the specificity 96.3 %. Infants with pertussis had more often paroxysmal cough, absence of fever and a higher absolute lymphocyte count than infants without pertussis. CONCLUSIONS: Pertussis is a serious disease in infants and it is often unrecognized; some features should help pediatricians to suspect pertussis, but clinical suspicion has a low sensitivity. We suggest a systematic use of Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction to support the clinical suspicion of pertussis in patients with less than 3 months of age hospitalized with acute respiratory symptoms.

Human TLR-7-, -8-, and -9-Mediated Induction of IFN-α/β and -λ Is IRAK-4 Dependent and Redundant for Protective Immunity to Viruses

Five TLRs are thought to play an important role in antiviral immunity, sensing viral products and inducing IFN-α/β and -λ. Surprisingly, patients with a defect of IRAK-4, a critical kinase downstream from TLRs, are resistant to common viruses. We show here that IFN-α/β and -λ induction via TLR-7, TLR-8, and TLR-9 was abolished in IRAK-4-deficient blood cells. In contrast, IFN-α/β and -λ were induced normally by TLR-3 and TLR-4 agonists. Moreover, IFN-β and -λ were normally induced by TLR-3 agonists and viruses in IRAK-4-deficient fibroblasts. We further show that IFN-α/β and -λ production in response to 9 of 11 viruses tested was normal or weakly affected in IRAK-4-deficient blood cells. Thus, IRAK-4-deficient patients may control viral infections by TLR-3- and TLR-4-dependent and/or TLR-independent production of IFNs. The TLR-7-, TLR-8-, and TLR-9-dependent induction of IFN-α/β and -λ is strictly IRAK-4 dependent and paradoxically redundant for protective immunity to most viruses in humans.

Specific binding of HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 to the structural membrane proteins ezrin and moesin

The observation that HIV in vitro can infect CD4-and Gal-C-negative brain cell lines has stimulated this study to identify alternative gp120-binding proteins on brain cells. HIV-1 gp120 binding proteins of the CD4-negative and Gal-C-negative, non-productively infectable human glioblastoma cell line D54 were purified by affinity chromatography over a gp120-conjugated sepharose column and identified by peptide microsequencing. The binding capacity and specificity of this column was controlled using extracts of CD4-positive cells. Two of seven prominent proteins eluted from the gp120 affinity column specifically bound gp120 in Western blot overlay experiments and were identified by subsequent immunoblotting and microsequencing as ezrin and moesin, members of the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) family of cellular structural membrane proteins. Antibodies to ezrin and moesin specifically recognized the eluted gp120 binding proteins confirming their identification. Ezrin and moesin are structural proteins binding to the cellular membrane and to several cytoskeletal and transmembrane proteins. Our results suggest that ezrin and moesin might play a role as gp160/gp120 binding proteins during the uptake, the assembly or the budding of HIV.

Planned Treatment of Advanced Metastatic Disease with Completion Ablation After Hepatic Resection.

PURPOSE The aim of this study is to describe a modified treatment strategy with image-guided percutaneous ablation after hepatic resection as a completion method to surgical eradication of liver metastases ("completion ablation [CA]"). METHODS We conducted a retrospective analyses of patients who underwent CA within 180 days from the liver surgical resection to eradicate liver metastases present on the pre-surgical cross-sectional imaging or identified during intraoperative ultrasound that were not resected due to various reasons. Lesions treated with CA were evaluated for local tumor progression (LTP). Patients were evaluated for hepatic- and overall-recurrence-free survivals (hepatic-RFS and overall-RFS, respectively) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS Sixteen patients (10 females; median age 55 years, range 28-69) underwent CA of 21 lesions (median size 8 mm, range 6 to 22). Indications for the use of CA were small future liver remnant in 10 (63%), inability to identify the lesion during surgical exploration in 3 (19%), and technical difficulty of resection in 3 (19%) patients. No liver-related complications were recorded following the surgical resection or the CA procedures. Primary and secondary CA efficacy rates were 95 and 100%, respectively. LTP was 0% at a median clinical follow-up of 27 months (range 4.0-108 months). Five-year hepatic-RFS, overall-RFS, and OS were 36, 16, and 51%, respectively. CONCLUSION The use of CA as a complement to surgical resection is safe and effective. Such approach could potentially expand the surgical candidacy for patients with limited liver functional reserve and reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality in this selected patient population with more advanced disease.

Chronic liver disease: current concepts of disease mechanisms

Optimal management of chronic liver disease requires an understanding of aetiological factors or conditions initiating and sustaining tissue damage. Injury may derive initially from toxin or xenobiotic exposure (direct, biotransformation adducts, hypersensitivity responses or immune‐mediated mechanisms), infectious organisms, inborn errors of metabolism, or pathological accumulations of transition metals (iron or copper), endotoxins or membranocytolytic bile acids. Secondarily, cells and mediators associated with inflammation, pathological expression of major histocompatibility foci on hepatocytes and biliary epithelia, aberrant initiation of apoptosis, modification of the extracellular matrix, and depletion of natural antioxidants can each play pivotal roles. Cholestatic liver injury derived from extrahepatic mechanical obstruction or intrahepatic cholestasis (many causes) can induce membrane damage subsequent to accumulation of membranocytolytic bile acids, copper retention, and membrane peroxidation. This paper reviews contemporary issues of chronic hepatocellular injury and hepatic fibrosis with the aim of broadening the clinical perspective of treatment strategies.

Point‐of‐care testing in primary care: A systematic review on implementation aspects addressed in test evaluations

OBJECTIVES: There are numerous point‐of‐care tests (POCTs) available on the market, but many of these are not used. This study reviewed literature pertaining to the evaluation/usage of POCTs in primary care, to investigate whether outcomes being reported reflect aspects previously demonstrated to be important for general practitioners (GPs) in the decision to implement a POCT in practice. METHODS: Scopus and Medline were searched to identify studies that evaluated a POCT in primary care. We identified abstracts and full‐texts consisting of applied studies (eg trials, simulations, observational studies) and qualitative studies (eg interviews, surveys). Data were extracted from the included studies, such as the type of study, the extent to which manufacturers were involved in the study, and the biomarker/assay measured by the test(s). Studies were evaluated to summarise the extent to which they reported on, amongst others, clinical utility, user‐friendliness, turnaround‐time and technical performance (aspects previously identified as important). RESULTS: The initial search resulted in 1398 publications, of which 125 met the inclusion criteria. From these studies, 83 POCTs across several disease areas (including cardiovascular disease, venous thromboembolism and respiratory‐tract‐infections) were identified. There was an inconsistency between what is reported in the studies and what GPs consider important. GPs perceive clinical utility as the most important aspect, yet this was rarely included explicitly in test evaluations in the literature, with only 8% of evaluations incorporating it in their analysis/discussion. CONCLUSIONS: This review showed that, despite the growing market and development of new POCTs, studies evaluating such tests fail to report on aspects that GPs find important. To ensure that an evaluation of a POCT is useful to primary care clinicians, future evaluations should not only focus on the technical performance aspects of a test, but also report on the aspects relating to the clinical utility and risks.

Role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in COVID-19

ABSTRACT: An outbreak of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that started in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 has become a global pandemic. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV enter host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is expressed in various human organs. We have reviewed previously published studies on SARS and recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), confirming that many other organs besides the lungs are vulnerable to the virus. ACE2 catalyzes angiotensin II conversion to angiotensin-(1–7), and the ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS axis counteracts the negative effects of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which plays important roles in maintaining the physiological and pathophysiological balance of the body. In addition to the direct viral effects and inflammatory and immune factors associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis, ACE2 downregulation and the imbalance between the RAS and ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS after infection may also contribute to multiple organ injury in COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, which binds to ACE2, is a potential target for developing specific drugs, antibodies, and vaccines. Restoring the balance between the RAS and ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS may help attenuate organ injuries. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: SARS-CoV-2 enters lung cells via the ACE2 receptor. The cell-free and macrophage-phagocytosed virus can spread to other organs and infect ACE2-expressing cells at local sites, causing multi-organ injury. [Image: see text]

[Expression of immune cells and their roles in the involved tissues of SARS patients].

OBJECTIVE To study the expression of the immune cell markers and their active antigens in the involved tissues of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS Specimens of the lungs, spleens and lymph nodes were obtained from autopsy of 3 SARS cases to investigate the expression of the immune cells and their activities with double immunohistochemical staining (DAB and AP) by using 14 immune cell markers and their active antigens. RESULTS A large quantity of proliferated macrophages could be observed in the lungs, spleens and lymph nodes of the SARS patients, some of which were positive for CD25 marker (active macrophages). In the lungs of the 3 patients, localized necrosis occurred where infiltration of CD45RO (+) T lymphocytes was observed, with only scarce Ki67 (+) T lymphocytes (active T lymphocytes) and B lymphocytes. In the lymph nodes, scattered T lymphocytes positive for Ki67 and CD45RO markers (active T lymphocytes) were seen, but the T lymphocytes subpopulations were obviously decreased, which was especially so with CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and NK cells. CONCLUSION Significantly enhanced activity of the macrophages occurs in SARS as the major reactive cells, but T lymphocyte subsets are obviously decreased, indicating the important roles of the macrophages and T lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of SARS.

Tissue chambers — a useful model for in vivo studies of cytokine production in the pig

An in vivo tissue chamber model was developed to enable studies of local cytokine production and cellular events during inflammatory and immune reactions in the pig. Tissue chambers made of sialistic rubber tubing were surgically implanted in the subcutaneous tissue and samples of tissue chamber fluid (TCF) and inflammatory cells were collected by aspiration with a syringe. To evaluate the model for local cytokine production, two cytokine inducers, polyribinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C) and fixed Aujeszky's disease virus infected PK15 cells (ADV-PK15), were injected into the tissue chambers and samples of TCF were collected 0, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h post injection. Poly I:C injections induced local production of interferon-α (IFN-α) as well as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the TCF but kinetic differences in the production of the cytokines were noted. Poly I:C also induced an increase in cell numbers in the TCF, mainly due to increased neutrophil numbers. Injections of ADV-PK15 induced local IFN-α production in the TCF as long as the pigs were serologically negative to ADV. Immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization techniques could be applied for characterization of TCF cells. Moreover, cells recovered from the tissue chambers were viable and could be used in functional in vitro tests. Taken together, this tissue chamber model could prove very useful in in vivo studies of inflammatory/immune responses and cytokine production in the pig.

Dynamic combinatorial chemistry: a tool to facilitate the identification of inhibitors for protein targets.

Dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) has emerged as a powerful strategy to identify ligands for biological targets given that it enables the target to direct the synthesis and amplification of its strongest binder(s) from the library of interconverting compounds. Since the first report of DCC applied to the discovery of binders for a protein, this elegant tool has been employed on a range of protein targets at various stages of medicinal-chemistry projects. A series of suitable, reversible reactions that are biocompatible have been established and the portfolio of analytical techniques is growing. Despite progress, in most cases, the libraries employed remain of moderate size. We present here the most recent advances in the field of DCC applied to protein targets, paying particular attention to the experimental conditions and analytical methods chosen.

Surgical complications specific to monopolar electrosurgical energy: engineering changes that have made electrosurgery safer.

Monopolar electrosurgical energy is the most commonly used energy source during laparotomic and laparoscopic surgery. The clinical application of monopolar energy is not without risk. Monopolar electrosurgical energy was introduced into surgical practice at the turn of the 20th century. Alternate site burns during laparotomic application were the most common complication for the first half century (i.e., ground point burns and dispersive electrode burns [1920-1970]). The aims of this article were to discuss historic design flaws associated with the most common alternate site burns, ground point burns, and dispersive electrode burns and the technological advancements introduced to mitigate these risks to the patient and to discuss current design flaws associated with stray energy burns during laparoscopy because of insulation failure and capacitive coupling and the technological advancements introduced to eliminate these risks to the patient. Today, insulation failure and capacitive coupling are the most common reasons for electrosurgical injury during laparocopic procedures. There is a need for advanced technology such as active electrode monitoring to address these invisible risks to the surgeon and their patients. In addition, the laparoscopic surgeon should be encouraged to study the basic biophysics involved in electrosurgery.

Laparoscopic versus open splenectomy for hypersplenism secondary to liver cirrhosis.

BACKGROUND Since the first laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) in 1991, LS has become the gold standard for the removal of normal-to-moderately enlarged spleens in benign conditions. Compared with open splenectomy (OS), fewer postsurgical complications and better postoperative recovery were observed, but it is contraindicated for hypersplenism secondary to liver cirrhosis owing to technical difficulties associated with splenomegaly, well-developed collateral circulation, and increased risk of bleeding. With the improvements of laparoscopic technique, the concept is changing. METHODS OS and LS performed for hypersplenism secondary to liver cirrhosis at our institution were analyzed. Relationships between postoperative increases in platelet counts, white blood cell counts, hemoglobin, and liver function were examined. Perioperative data of LSs were compared with those of OSs, including operative time, blood loss, excised spleen weight, complications, and hospital stays. RESULTS A total of 216 splenectomies (135 OS and 81 LS) were performed from April 1999 to March 2007. Five laparoscopic cases were converted to open surgery owing to operative bleeding or bleeding of splenic fossa. The other 76 patients were performed LSs successfully. No major operative complications occurred. There was no operative death. Excised spleen weight >400 g was present in 56% of cases in this series. At 7 days postoperatively, the platelet counts, white blood cell counts, and hemoglobin significantly increased after open and laparoscopic surgeries, and increase of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and directed bilirubin of LS were significantly different with open cases. Operation times of LS and OS were 2.9+/-0.7 hours and 2.6+/-0.6 hours, respectively. Blood losses were 150.6+/-135.4 mL and 633.8+/-340.3 mL (P<0.01), excised spleen weights were 585.7+/-184.6 g and 591.1+/-153.4 g (P>0.05), and hospital stay were 8.2+/-2.0 days and 11.9+/-3.8 days (P<0.01). Operative associated complications were noted in both LS and OS. Less blood loss, shorter hospital stay, and less impairment of liver function were observed in LS than OS. CONCLUSIONS LS is feasible, effective, and safe procedures for hypersplenism secondary to liver cirrhosis and contributes to less impairment of liver function, less blood loss, and shorter hospital stay.

Identification of influenza A nucleoprotein as an antiviral target

Influenza A remains a significant public health challenge because of the emergence of antigenically shifted or highly virulent strains(1,2,3,4,5). Antiviral resistance to available drugs such as adamantanes or neuraminidase inhibitors has appeared rapidly(6,7,8,9), creating a need for new antiviral targets and new drugs for influenza virus infections. Using forward chemical genetics, we have identified influenza A nucleoprotein (NP) as a druggable target and found a small-molecule compound, nucleozin, that triggers the aggregation of NP and inhibits its nuclear accumulation. Nucleozin impeded influenza A virus replication in vitro with a nanomolar median effective concentration (EC(50)) and protected mice challenged with lethal doses of avian influenza A H5N1. Our results demonstrate that viral NP is a valid target for the development of small-molecule therapies. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nbt.1638) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Risks and burden of viral respiratory tract infections in patients with multiple myeloma in the era of immunomodulatory drugs and bortezomib: experience at an Australian Cancer Hospital

INTRODUCTION: Infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with multiple myeloma. The epidemiology, risk factors and outcomes of viral respiratory tract infections (vRTI) are not well described in patients with multiple myeloma managed with novel agents, the current standard of care. METHODS: Patients with myeloma from 2009 to 2012 who tested positive on respiratory virus multiplex polymerase chain reaction had clinical, radiological and microbiological records reviewed. The Fourth European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL-4) definitions of RTI were applied. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis of risk factors was performed using vRTI as the evaluable outcome. RESULTS: Of 330 patients, 75 (22.7 %) tested positive for a total of 100 vRTI episodes. All patients received thalidomide, lenalidomide or bortezomib in combination with myeloma therapies (median of three treatment regimens). vRTI occurred most commonly in patients with progressive disease, and receipt of more than three lines of myeloma therapy was associated with an increased risk of vRTI (p < 0.01). Amongst key respiratory pathogens, influenza was associated with the highest hospital admission rate (66.7 %), ICU admission rate (41.6 %) and mortality (33.3 %) whilst RSV was associated with prolonged hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Patients with multiple myeloma and advanced disease managed with multiple lines of therapy are at risk for vRTI, and targeted interventions for prevention/treatment are required.

Chapter 15 Innate Humoral Defense Factors

Abstract Although innate immunity came into the research spotlight in the late 1990s when its instructive role in the adaptive immune response was recognized, innate humoral defense factors have a much older history. The exocrine secretions of the body contain a plethora of distinct soluble factors (lysozyme, lactoferrin, peroxidases, proline-rich proteins, histatins, etc.) that protect the body from mucosal microbial pathogens. More recent studies have established that the humoral arm of innate immunity contains a heterogeneous group of pattern-recognition molecules (e.g., pentraxins, collectins, and ficolins), which perform diverse host-defense functions, such as agglutination and neutralization, opsonization, control of inflammation, and complement activation and regulation. These pattern-recognition molecules, which act as functional predecessors of antibodies (“ante-antibodies”), and the classic soluble innate defense factors form an integrated system with complementary specificity, action, and tissue distribution, and they are the subject of this chapter.

Phylogenetic nomenclature and evolution of mannose-binding lectin (MBL2) haplotypes

BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms of the mannose-binding lectin gene (MBL2) affect the concentration and functional efficiency of the protein. We recently used haplotype-specific sequencing to identify 23 MBL2 haplotypes, associated with enhanced susceptibility to several diseases. RESULTS: In this work, we applied the same method in 288 and 470 chromosomes from Gabonese and European adults, respectively, and found three new haplotypes in the last group. We propose a phylogenetic nomenclature to standardize MBL2 studies and found two major phylogenetic branches due to six strongly linked polymorphisms associated with high MBL production. They presented high Fst values and were imbedded in regions with high nucleotide diversity and significant Tajima's D values. Compared to others using small sample sizes and unphased genotypic data, we found differences in haplotyping, frequency estimation, Fu and Li's D* and Fst results. CONCLUSION: Using extensive testing for selective neutrality, we confirmed that stochastic evolutionary factors have had a major role in shaping this polymorphic gene worldwide.

RNA helicase signaling is critical for type i interferon production and protection against Rift Valley fever virus during mucosal challenge.

Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an emerging RNA virus with devastating economic and social consequences. Clinically, RVFV induces a gamut of symptoms ranging from febrile illness to retinitis, hepatic necrosis, hemorrhagic fever, and death. It is known that type I interferon (IFN) responses can be protective against severe pathology; however, it is unknown which innate immune receptor pathways are crucial for mounting this response. Using both in vitro assays and in vivo mucosal mouse challenge, we demonstrate here that RNA helicases are critical for IFN production by immune cells and that signaling through the helicase adaptor molecule MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling) is protective against mortality and more subtle pathology during RVFV infection. In addition, we demonstrate that Toll-like-receptor-mediated signaling is not involved in IFN production, further emphasizing the importance of the RNA cellular helicases in type I IFN responses to RVFV.

Algorithm Combination for Improved Performance in Biosurveillance: Univariate Monitoring

This chapter proposes an enhancement to currently used algorithms for monitoring daily counts of pre-diagnostic data. Rather than use a single algorithm or apply multiple algorithms simultaneously, our approach is based on ensembles of algorithms. The ensembles lead to better performance in terms of higher true alert rates for a given false alert rate. Combinations can be employed at the data preprocessing step and/or at the monitoring step. We discuss the advantages of such an approach and illustrate its usefulness using authentic modern biosurveillance data.

10 Infectious Disease Genomics

Abstract The history and development of infectious disease genomics have been closely associated with the Human Genome Project (HGP) during the past 20years. It has been emphasized since the beginning of the HGP that such effort must not be restricted to the human genome and should include other organisms including mouse, bacteria, yeast, fruit fly, and worm for comparative sequence analyses. A brief history is reviewed in this chapter. As of 2016, more than 7000 completed genome sequencing projects have been reported. One of the important motivations for these efforts is to develop preventative, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies through the analysis of sequenced microorganisms, parasites, and vectors related to human health. A number of examples are discussed in this chapter.

Lupus anticoagulant is frequent in patients with Covid‐19

Patients hospitalized for Covid-19 severe infection are more prone to excessive coagulation activation leading to thrombotic events. Tang et al.1 discussed the importance of high D-dimer and Fibrin degradation product level to determine the patient prognostic and the risk of thrombosis. However they did not look at lupus anticoagulant (LAC). Zhang et al. described, three cases of thrombosis associated with antiphospholipid antibodies represented by anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-β2-glycoprotein I (aβ2GPI)2. No lupus anticoagulant was detected in any of the patients.

Advice from a systems-biology model of the corona epidemics

Using standard systems biology methodologies a 14-compartment dynamic model was developed for the Corona virus epidemic. The model predicts that: (i) it will be impossible to limit lockdown intensity such that sufficient herd immunity develops for this epidemic to die down, (ii) the death toll from the SARS-CoV-2 virus decreases very strongly with increasing intensity of the lockdown, but (iii) the duration of the epidemic increases at first with that intensity and then decreases again, such that (iv) it may be best to begin with selecting a lockdown intensity beyond the intensity that leads to the maximum duration, (v) an intermittent lockdown strategy should also work and might be more acceptable socially and economically, (vi) an initially intensive but adaptive lockdown strategy should be most efficient, both in terms of its low number of casualties and shorter duration, (vii) such an adaptive lockdown strategy offers the advantage of being robust to unexpected imports of the virus, e.g. due to international travel, (viii) the eradication strategy may still be superior as it leads to even fewer deaths and a shorter period of economic downturn, but should have the adaptive strategy as backup in case of unexpected infection imports, (ix) earlier detection of infections is the most effective way in which the epidemic can be controlled, whilst waiting for vaccines.

The Usual Suspects: Chemokines and Microbial Infection of the Central Nervous System

For many years, the central nervous system (CNS) was considered an “immunologically privileged site” — a perspective based on limited immune surveillance when compared to peripheral tissue, muted expression of MHC molecules in the context of an apparent lack of professional antigen presenting cells, and the absence of a classical lymphatic drainage system. Together, these observations supported the notion that the CNS was unable to mount and/or support an immune response. However, over time this view evolved and it is now clear that CNS tissue is neither immunologically inert nor privileged, rather, its immune response is exquisitely sensitive to antigenic challenge. Indeed, overwhelming evidence now indicates that upon microbial infection of the CNS there is often a dynamic and orchestrated localized immune response that culminates with infiltration of antigen-specific lymphocytes, usually resulting in control and elimination of the invading pathogen. It is important to note that not all effective immune responses originating in the CNS are completely beneficial to the host; alternatively, there are instances where immune cell infiltration following infection is associated with severe neuropathology resulting in death or chronic neurodegenerative disease.

COVID-19 and Diabetes: Knowledge in Progress

Abstract Aims We aimed to briefly review the general characteristics of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and provide a better understanding of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in people with diabetes, and its management. Methods We searched for articles in PubMed and Google Scholar databases till 02 April 2020, with the following keywords: “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “infection”, “pathogenesis”, “incubation period”, “transmission”, “clinical features”, “diagnosis”, “treatment”, “diabetes”, with interposition of the Boolean operator “AND”. Results The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and death. Older age, diabetes and other comorbidities are reported as significant predictors of morbidity and mortality. Chronic inflammation, increased coagulation activity, immune response impairment, and potential direct pancreatic damage by SARS-CoV-2 might be among the underlying mechanisms of the association between diabetes and COVID-19. No conclusive evidence exists to support the discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers because of COVID-19 in people with diabetes. Caution should be taken to potential hypoglycemic events with the use of chloroquine in these subjects. Patient tailored therapeutic strategies, rigorous glucose monitoring and careful consideration of drug interactions might reduce adverse outcomes. Conclusions Suggestions are made on the possible pathological mechanisms of the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19, and its management. No definite conclusions can be made based on current limited evidence. Further research regarding this relationship and its clinical management is warranted.

DC-SIGN and immunoregulation.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are known to be the most powerful professional antigen-presenting cells so far. It could activate primary immune response, and also downregulate immune response. DCs have a unique character of immunoregulation. DC-SIGN, a molecule designated as CD209, is one member of the C-type lectin superfamily. It is not only a pattern recognition receptor but implicated in immunoregulation of DCs. DC-SIGN has become hotspot of recent studies because of its important role in mediating DC adhesion, migration, inflammation, activating primary T cell, triggering immune response and participating in immune escape of pathogens and tumors. These studies on DC-SIGN involved in primary and secondary immune response and relevant mechanism will certainly provide us with a new method in treating and preventing certain diseases.

Delivering oxygen-enriched CPAP respiratory support using a non-invasive ventilation device

Here we report an investigation to adapt existing non-invasive ventilators (NIV) capable of delivering CPAP for use with oxygen to deliver enriched ventilation of 40%+ FiO2. Our intention is to maximise use of existing resources available to HCPs, as NIV and sleep apnoea (CPAP) machines are widely available, to deliver therapeutic benefit and potentially avoid the need for positive pressure ventilation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hand Awareness.

The concept of Hand Awareness affects a more comprehensive respiratory infection prevention plan than vaccine immunization alone, as most respiratory infections do not have a vaccine solution. Additionally, the resurgence of measles, mumps, and pertussis in those who have been vaccinated is a good reminder that we must improve our approach to respiratory infection prevention. Weak links exist in the vaccine production and administration chain. It is not the panacea we once hoped. Changing behavior, while very difficult, is critical in order to have a greater impact on reducing all respiratory infections. Hand Awareness is defined as an integrated approach of hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, and cross-contamination awareness practices or, in lay terms, knowing where your hands are and what they are doing at all times. Teaching strategies and resources are explored to assist with student understanding and application of desired behaviors that will achieve the greatest impact of both student and staff productivity and wellness.

Identification of a novel linear B-cell epitope in nonstructural protein 11 of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus that are conserved in both genotypes

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most economically important pathogens, that hinder the development of global pork industry. Its nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11), with the nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) domain, is essential for PRRSV genome replication and it also contributes to host innate immunity suppression. However, the immunogenicity and immune structure of PRRSV nsp11 have not been well investigated yet. In this study, a monoclonal antibody (mAb), designated 3F9, that against nsp11 was generated. Subsequently, a series of partially overlapped fragments, covered the nsp11(40-223aa), were expressed to test the reactivity with mAb 3F9, and the (111)DCREY(115) was found to be the core unit of the B-cell epitope recognized by mAb 3F9. Further investigation indicated that both genotype 1 and genotype 2 PRRSV can be recognized by mAb 3F9, due to the (111)DCREY(115) is conserved in both genotype virus. Meanwhile, this epitope, localized at the surface of nsp11 in 3D structure, is confirmed to be able to induce humoral immune response in PRRSV infected pigs. These findings do not only provide an mAb tool to further investigate the function of nsp11, they also indicate the diagnostic potential for this epitope.

Heightened innate immune responses in the respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients

Summary The outbreaks of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has posed a severe threat to global public health. It is unclear how the human immune system responds to this infection. Here, we used metatranscriptomic sequencing to profile immune signatures in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of eight COVID-19 cases. The expression of proinflammatory genes, especially chemokines, was markedly elevated in COVID-19 cases compared to community-acquired pneumonia patients and healthy controls, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes hypercytokinemia. Compared to SARS-CoV, which is thought to induce inadequate interferon (IFN) responses, SARS-CoV-2 robustly triggered expression of numerous IFN-inducible genes (ISGs). These ISGs exhibit immunopathogenic potential, with overrepresentation of genes involved in inflammation. The transcriptome data was also used to estimate immune cell populations, revealing increases in activated dendritic cells and neutrophils. Collectively, these host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection could further our understanding of disease pathogenesis and point towards antiviral strategies.

COVID-19 and maternal mental health: Are we getting the balance right?

This paper presents a rapid evidence review into the clinical and psychological impacts of COVID-19 on perinatal women and their infants. Literature search revealed that there is very little formal evidence on the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant, labouring and postnatal women or their babies. The clinical evidence to date suggests that pregnant and childbearing women, and their babies are not at increased risk of either getting infected, or of having severe symptoms or consequences than the population as a whole. There is no evidence on the short- and longer-term psychological impacts of restrictive practices or social and personal constraints for childbearing women during COVID-19 in particular, or infection pandemics in general. The potential for adverse mental health consequences of the pandemic should be recognised as a critical public health concern, together with appropriate care and support to prevent and ameliorate any negative impacts.

Human picornavirus and coronavirus RNA in nasopharynx of children without concurrent respiratory symptoms

The prevalence of human rhino‐, entero‐, and coronaviruses was investigated by RT‐PCR in nasopharyngeal aspirates from 107 children without concurrent respiratory symptoms. The children were admitted to the hospital for elective surgery. The parents filled a questionnaire about the occurrence of respiratory symptoms four weeks before and two weeks after the surgery. The rate of viral detection was 45% in children with related past or recent respiratory infection whereas 20% of the samples taken from children without any related past or recent respiratory infections were positive for picornavirus RNA, P = 0.008. Thirty‐one (29%) of the nasopharyngeal aspirates were positive for viral RNA, 18% for rhinovirus, and 11% for enterovirus RNA. Coronavirus RNA was not found in any of the children. Fifty‐five percent of the children with virus‐positive samples had an infection‐related diagnosis. In addition, 81% of the children with virus‐positive samples had had previously respiratory symptoms or there were concurrent respiratory symptoms in other family members. Only four of the 31 virus‐positive samples were from children without infection‐related diagnosis or recent past (or immediate future) respiratory symptoms. J. Med.

Impact of supplementary immunization activities in measles-endemic areas: a case study from Guangxi, China.

Because of limited resources, each year during the period from 1999 through 2007, only about one-quarter of the 111 counties in Guangxi province were selected by means of risk assessment to participate in Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs), targeting children aged 8 months to 14 years during 1999-2003 and 8 months to 10 years during 2004-2007. Approximately 2 million doses of measles vaccines were administrated each year during SIAs. Estimated from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, with a reliable internal consistency over years, the average annual incidences of measles before SIAs (1993-1998), during the first phase (1999-2003), and during the second phase (2004-2007) were 16.05, 9.10, and 2.46 cases per 100,000, respectively. The overall provincewide annual incidence decreased by 84.67%, from 12.12 cases per 100,000 in 2000 to 2.10 cases per 100,000 in 2007. The percentage of counties with annual incidence ≥10 cases per 100,000 decreased from 55% in 1993 to <1% in 2007. Compared with the pre-SIA period, the greatest decrease in annual incidence was 83.93% for the 10-14.9-year-old group and the smallest decrease was 46.16% for children <1 year old. The multiple-year SIAs targeting children in selected high-risk counties were effective in controlling measles in mountainous, impoverished, and multiethnic measles-endemic areas.

Towards a small animal model for hepatitis C

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes chronic liver disease and affects an estimated 3% of the world's population. Options for the prevention or therapy of HCV infection are limited; there is no vaccine and the nonspecific, interferon-based treatments now in use are frequently ineffective and have significant side effects. A small-animal model for HCV infection would significantly expedite antiviral compound development and preclinical testing, as well as open new avenues to decipher the mechanisms that underlie viral pathogenesis. The natural species tropism of HCV is, however, limited to humans and chimpanzees. Here, we discuss the prospects of developing a mouse model for HCV infection, taking into consideration recent results on HCV entry and replication, and new prospects in xenotransplantation biology. We highlight three independent, but possibly complementary, approaches towards overcoming current species barriers and generating a small-animal model for HCV pathogenesis.

Patient-collected tongue, nasal, and mid-turbinate swabs for SARS-CoV-2 yield equivalent sensitivity to health care worker collected nasopharyngeal swabs

Background: Current testing for SARS-CoV-2 requires health care workers to collect a nasopharyngeal (NP) sample from a patient. NP sampling requires the use of personal protective equipment that are in limited supply, is uncomfortable for the patient, and reduces clinical efficiency. This study explored the equivalency of patient-collected tongue, anterior nares (nasal), and mid-turbinate (MT) samples to health care worker-collected NP samples for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Patients presenting to five urgent care facilities with symptoms indicative of an upper respiratory infection provided self-collected samples from three anatomic sites along with a health care worker-collected NP sample. Using NP as the comparator, sensitivities and one-sided 95% confidence intervals for the tongue, nasal, and MT samples for detection of SARS-CoV-2 were calculated. Results: The sensitivity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patient-collected tongue, nasal, and mid-turbinate samples was 89.8% (95% CI: 80.2 -100.0), 94.0 (95% CI: 84.6-100.0) and 96.2 (95% CI: 87.7-100.0), respectively. Among samples yielding positive results, cycle threshold (Ct) values (a measure of viral load) had correlation coefficients of 0.48, 0.78, and 0.86 between the NP samples and the tongue, nasal, and MT samples, respectively. Conclusions: Patient-collected nasal and MT samples demonstrated high sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection using health care worker-collected NP samples as the comparator. Among patients testing positive with NP samples, nasal and MT Ct values demonstrated high correlations with those Ct values of the NP samples. Patient-collected nasal or MT sampling may improve efficiency for COVID-19 testing while reducing the risk of exposure of the health workforce.

Human rabies in China: evidence-based suggestions for improved case detection and data gathering

BACKGROUND: China still suffers heavily from rabies, although reported human cases continue to decrease year over year. There are far fewer laboratory-confirmed human cases than clinically diagnosed cases, which is a big problem that needs to be addressed. In this report, we summarize analyses of all specimens from human cases tested in our laboratory over the past 15 years, in order to promote laboratory diagnosis of rabies. METHODS: From 2005 to 2019, a total of 271 samples from 164 suspected rabies cases were collected from local hospitals by the local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) in China. Saliva, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum (blood) and urine were collected for ante-mortem diagnosis, and brain tissue, neck skin tissue and cornea were collected for post-mortem diagnosis. All of the specimens were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and brain tissues were also tested using fluorescent antibody test (FAT). The number of positive test results obtained using different fluids or tissues, and at different stages of the disease, were compared using a chi-square test and a more effective sampling program is recommended. RESULTS: As the national reference laboratory for rabies surveillance in China, our laboratory has tested 271 samples from 164 suspected rabies cases collected by local CDCs since 2005. We found that saliva gave the highest number of positive test results (32%), compared with CSF and other fluids. We also found that serum or blood specimens collected in the last 3 days of life can test positive by RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Serum or blood samples collected in the last 3 days of a patient’s life can be used to measure viral RNA, which means that serum samples, as well as saliva and CSF, can be used to detect viral RNA for anti-mortem diagnosis of rabies. Because of our findings, we have modified our “National Surveillance Project for Human Rabies”, by adding the collection and testing of serum samples from the end of the survival period. This will improve our national surveillance and laboratory diagnosis of human rabies.

Public health in practice: the three domains of public health

Summary This paper outlines a conceptual model for public health practice by proposing the three domains as a framework to organize and to deliver public health programmes. The model builds on the recognition that public health is everybody's business and therefore, needs a common definitional base. Different levels of skill and a wide range of contributions are needed if public health programmes are to make the most impact. The different domains of practice help to construct a basis for understanding the necessary elements of the public health system and their interactions. Using teenage pregnancy as a case study of a public health programme highlights the characteristics of the model. It demonstrates not only the importance of the role of directors of public health in taking a population-based overview, but also the need for multisectoral, multidisciplinary working. The relevance of the public health approach not only to primary care but also to the hospital-based sector becomes apparent, as does its relevance to communities, voluntary sector and local government. Integration of the three domains, a common definition and the framework for the public health system will support effective delivery of health improvement.

Systems Vaccinology Identifies an Early Innate Immune Signature as a Correlate of Antibody Responses to the Ebola Vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV

Predicting vaccine efficacy remains a challenge. We used a systems vaccinology approach to identify early innate immune correlates of antibody induction in humans receiving the Ebola vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV. Blood samples from days 0, 1, 3, 7, and 14 were analyzed for changes in cytokine levels, innate immune cell subsets, and gene expression. Integrative statistical analyses with cross-validation identified a signature of 5 early innate markers correlating with antibody titers on day 28 and beyond. Among those, IP-10 on day 3 and MFI of CXCR6 on NK cells on day 1 were independent correlates. Consistently, we found an early gene expression signature linked to IP-10. This comprehensive characterization of early innate immune responses to the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in humans revealed immune signatures linked to IP-10. These results suggest correlates of vaccine-induced antibody induction and provide a rationale to explore strategies for augmenting the effectiveness of vaccines through manipulation of IP-10.

Evaluating features of scientific conferences: A call for improvements

Scientific conferences provide valuable opportunities for researchers across career stages and disciplines to present their latest work and to network with their peers. The advent of the internet has opened new possibilities for interaction, collaboration and networking, yet the uptake of tools enabling remote participation at scientific meetings has been slow. Academic conferences have become more international with high proliferation in the number of meetings and attendees, but the format and quality of their organization lags behind what is possible. As a result, the experience of attending conferences in many disciplines today is not appreciably different in many respects. A few conferences in some disciplines have recently implemented valuable changes for the community and have become more receptive to attendees with families. Many meetings could still be improved significantly in terms of diversity, inclusivity, promoting early career researcher (ECR) networking and career development, venue accessibility, and more importantly, reducing the meetings’ carbon footprint. These issues are openly visible and to some extent discussed among researchers on social media. It is important to accelerate and mandate these efforts so that researchers in all disciplines, in particular ECRs, consistently benefit from scientific gatherings, for years to come. We examined the current state of over 260 national and international academic meetings in various disciplines for features of inclusivity and sustainability and propose solutions to make conferences more modern, effective, equitable and intellectually productive for the research community and environmentally sustainable for our planet. “They always say time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself.” — Andy Warhol

Complementing conventional infectious disease surveillance with national health insurance claims data in the Republic of Korea

Surveillance remains an important tool for timely outbreak detection and response. Many countries, including Korea, have established national infectious disease surveillance systems with clinical notification. We aimed to evaluate the National Health Insurance Claims-based Surveillance (NHICS) compared to conventional passive report-based National Infectious Diseases Surveillance (NIDS). Reported to claimed cases ratios (R/C ratio) were evaluated from monthly notifiable disease cases captured by NIDS and NHICS. The relationships between 26 infectious diseases and each surveillance system were analysed using Pearson’s correlation analysis and linear regression. There was an overall increase in R/C ratio from 2010–2017 (0.37 to 0.78). In 22 infectious diseases, there was a correlation between NIDS and NHICS. Moreover, claim-based surveillance showed less fluctuating disease incidence rates than report-based surveillance for specific infectious diseases, such as varicella, mumps, and scarlet fever. However, for infectious diseases with episodic outbreaks or low incidence, it was difficult to assess NHICS usefulness. Claim-based surveillance is less affected by limitations of conventional report-based surveillance systems, such as reporting rate. Given delays in claim systems, a claim-based surveillance is expected to be complementary to conventional systems for the detection of various infectious diseases with the advancement of bio-information technology.

Anti-thrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and intracranial hemorrhage.

Patients with atrial fibrillation have an increased risk of ischemic stroke that can be dramatically lowered by treatment with anticoagulants. The annual rate of major bleeds with warfarin averages about 2%. The rates of intracerebral and intracranial bleeds are significantly reduced with the use of the novel direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) compared with warfarin. Treatment of anticoagulation-related intracerebral hemorrhage is based on the results of case series and small trials. Resumption of anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation who had an intracerebral bleed depends on the etiology and location of the bleeding and the absolute rate of stroke in the absence of anticoagulation.

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Inhibits Type I Interferon Production by Interfering with TRIM25-Mediated RIG-I Ubiquitination.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a respiratory disease, caused by a coronavirus (SARS-CoV), that is characterized by atypical pneumonia. The nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of SARS-CoV plays an important role in inhibition of type I interferon (IFN) production via an unknown mechanism. In this study, the SARS-CoV N protein was found to bind to the SPRY domain of the tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25) E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby interfering with the association between TRIM25 and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and inhibiting TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination and activation. Type I IFN production induced by poly I·C or Sendai virus (SeV) was suppressed by the SARS-CoV N protein. SARS-CoV replication was increased by overexpression of the full-length N protein but not N amino acids 1 to 361, which could not interact with TRIM25. These findings provide an insightful interpretation of the SARS-CoV-mediated host innate immune suppression caused by the N protein.IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV N protein is essential for the viral life cycle and plays a key role in the virus-host interaction. We demonstrated that the interaction between the C terminus of the N protein and the SPRY domain of TRIM25 inhibited TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination, which resulted in the inhibition of IFN production. We also found that the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) N protein interacted with TRIM25 and inhibited RIG-I signaling. The outcomes of these findings indicate the function of the coronavirus N protein in modulating the host's initial innate immune response.

A screen of the NIH Clinical Collection small molecule library identifies potential anti-coronavirus drugs

Abstract With the recent emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus in humans and the outbreak of devastating porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus in swine, therapeutic intervention is urgently needed. However, anti-coronavirus drugs currently are not available. In an effort to assist rapid development of anti-coronavirus drugs, here we screened the NIH Clinical Collection in cell culture using a luciferase reporter-expressing recombinant murine coronavirus. Of the 727 compounds screened, 84 were found to have a significant anti-coronavirus effect. Further experiments revealed that 51 compounds blocked virus entry while 19 others inhibited viral replication. Additional validation studies with the top 3 inhibitors (hexachlorophene, nitazoxanide and homoharringtonine) demonstrated robust anti-coronavirus activities (a reduction of 6 to 8log10 in virus titer) with an IC50 ranging from 11nM to 1.2μM. Furthermore, homoharringtonine and hexachlorophene exhibited broad antiviral activity against diverse species of human and animal coronaviruses. Since the NIH Clinical Collection consists of compounds that have already been through clinical trials, these small molecule inhibitors have a great potential for rapid development as anti-coronavirus drugs.

Factors Associated With Prolonged Viral Shedding in Patients With Avian Influenza A(H7N9) Virus Infection

BACKGROUND. Data are limited on the impact of neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) treatment on avian influenza A(H7N9) virus RNA shedding. METHODS. In this multicenter, retrospective study, data were collected from adults hospitalized with A(H7N9) infection during 2013–2017 in China. We compared clinical features and A(H7N9) shedding among patients with different NAI doses and combination therapies and evaluated factors associated with A(H7N9) shedding, using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS. Among 478 patients, the median age was 56 years, 71% were male, and 37% died. The median time from illness onset to NAI treatment initiation was 8 days (interquartile range [IQR], 6–10 days), and the median duration of A(H7N9) RNA detection from onset was 15.5 days (IQR, 12–20 days). A(H7N9) RNA shedding was shorter in survivors than in patients who died (P < .001). Corticosteroid administration (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .50-.77]) and delayed NAI treatment (HR, 0.90 [95% CI, .91-.96]) were independent risk factors for prolonged A(H7N9) shedding. There was no significant difference in A(H7N9) shedding duration between NAI combination treatment and monotherapy (P = .65) or between standard-dose and double-dose oseltamivir treatment (P = .70). CONCLUSIONS. Corticosteroid therapy and delayed NAI treatment were associated with prolonged A(H7N9) RNA shedding. NAI combination therapy and double-dose oseltamivir treatment were not associated with a reduced A(H7N9) shedding duration as compared to standard-dose oseltamivir.

Highly efficient in vivo delivery of PMO into regenerating myotubes and rescue in laminin-α2 chain-null congenital muscular dystrophy mice

Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO)-mediated exon skipping is among the more promising approaches to the treatment of several neuromuscular disorders including Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The main weakness of this approach arises from the low efficiency and sporadic nature of the delivery of charge-neutral PMO into muscle fibers, the mechanism of which is unknown. In this study, to test our hypothesis that muscle fibers take up PMO more efficiently during myotube formation, we induced synchronous muscle regeneration by injection of cardiotoxin into the tibialis anterior muscle of Dmd exon 52-deficient mdx52 and wild-type mice. Interestingly, by in situ hybridization, we detected PMO mainly in embryonic myosin heavy chain-positive regenerating fibers. In addition, we showed that PMO or 2′-O-methyl phosphorothioate is taken up efficiently into C2C12 myotubes when transfected 24–72 h after the induction of differentiation but is poorly taken up into undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts suggesting efficient uptake of PMO in the early stages of C2C12 myotube formation. Next, we tested the therapeutic potential of PMO for laminin-α2 chain-null dy(3K)/dy(3K) mice: a model of merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1A) with active muscle regeneration. We confirmed the recovery of laminin-α2 chain and slightly prolonged life span following skipping of the mutated exon 4 in dy(3K)/dy(3K) mice. These findings support the idea that PMO entry into fibers is dependent on a developmental stage in myogenesis rather than on dystrophinless muscle membranes and provide a platform for developing PMO-mediated therapies for a variety of muscular disorders, such as MDC1A, that involve active muscle regeneration.

A Component Analysis of the Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) Program for Mindful Parenting by Mothers of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder

OBJECTIVES: Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) has been shown to be effective in reducing stress and burnout in parents and professional caregivers of children and adolescents with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The aim of this study was to assess the comparative effects of the mindfulness (MB) and positive behavior support (PBS) components against the MBPBS program for mindful parenting. METHODS: The study utilized a three-arm randomized controlled trial design, with a 10-week pre-treatment control condition, 30 weeks of intervention, and 3 years of post-intervention follow-up. Mothers of children with ASD were randomly assigned to the MB, PBS, and MBPBS conditions and provided 3 days of training specific to each condition. The effects of these programs were assessed on the mothers (i.e., training attendance, meditation time, perceived psychological stress) and spillover effects were assessed on their children with ASD (i.e., aggression, disruptive behavior, compliance with mothers’ requests). RESULTS: Mothers in the MBPBS condition reported greater reductions in perceived psychological stress, followed by those in the MB condition, and with no significant changes reported by those in the PBS condition. Reduction in the children’s aggression and disruptive behavior followed a similar pattern, with most to least significant reductions being in MBPBS, MB, and PBS condition, respectively. Significant increases in compliance (i.e., responsiveness to mothers’ requests) were largest in the MBPBS condition, followed by MB, and then PBS. Changes across all variables for both mothers and their children were maintained for 3 years post-intervention. After time and training type were controlled for, meditation time was a significant predictor in reducing aggressive and disruptive behaviors, and in enhancing compliance of the children with mothers’ requests. CONCLUSIONS: Positive outcomes for mothers and their children with ASD were significantly greater in the MBPBS condition, followed by the MB condition, and least in the PBS condition. MBPBS appears to be an effective mindful parenting program on the assessed variables.

Potential mechanisms of cardiac injury and common pathways of inflammation in patients with COVID-19

Due to the lack of prospective, randomized, controlled clinical studies on inflammation and cardiovascular involvement, the exact mechanism of cardiac injury among patients with COVID-19 still remains uncertain. It was demonstrated that there is a high and significantly positive linear correlation between troponin T and plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, biomarkers of cardiac injury and systemic inflammation, respectively. Cardiac injury and inflammation is a relatively common association among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and it is related to higher risk of in-hospital mortality. In our literature search, we identified several potential mechanisms of myocardial tissue damage, namely, coronavirus-associated acute myocarditis, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor binding affinity to the virus Spike protein, increased cytokine secretion, and hypoxia induced cardiac myocyte apoptosis. Elucidation of the disease pathogenesis and prospective histopathological studies are crucial for future proper treatment in case of renewed outbreaks. Of interest is that with hundred of thousands of bodies available for autopsy studies, no prospective investigation has been reported so far. Strong efforts and continued research of the cardiovascular complications and identification of risk factors for poor prognosis in COVID-19 are steadily needed. The high morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, its monumental economic burden and social impact, the despair of a new pandemic outbreak, and the thread of potential utilization of novel SARS-CoV2 as biologic weapons make it a preponderant necessity to better comprehend the therapeutic management of this lethal disease. Emerging as an acute infectious disease, COVID-19 may become a chronic epidemic because of genetic recombination. Therefore, we should be ready for the reemergence of COVID-19 or other coronaviruses.

Systems analysis of West Nile virus infection

Emerging and re-emerging mosquito-borne viruses continue to pose a significant threat to human health throughout the world. Over the past decade, West Nile virus (WNV), Dengue virus (DENV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), have caused annual epidemics of virus-induced encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever\shock syndromes, and arthritis, respectively. Currently, no specific antiviral therapies or vaccines exist for use in humans to combat or prevent these viral infections. Thus, there is a pressing need to define the virus-host interactions that govern immunity and infection outcome. Recent technological breakthroughs in ‘omics’ resources and high-throughput based assays are beginning to accelerate antiviral drug discovery and improve on current strategies for vaccine design. In this review, we highlight studies with WNV and discuss how traditional and systems based approaches are being used to rapidly identify novel host targets for therapeutic intervention and develop a deeper conceptual understanding of the host response to virus infection.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and neonate: What neonatologist need to know

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause china epidemics with high morbidity and mortality, the infection has been transmitted to other countries. About three neonates and more than 230 children cases are reported. The disease condition of the main children was mild. There is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted transplacentally from mother to the newborn. The treatment strategy for children with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is based on adult experience. Thus far, no deaths have been reported in the pediatric age group. This review describes the current understanding of COVID-19 infection in newborns and children.

Predictive impact of early mobilization on rehospitalization for elderly Japanese heart failure patients

The aim of this study was to determine whether early mobilization was associated with rehospitalization among elderly heart failure patients. We measured the time from admission to mobilization and other clinical characteristics for 190 heart failure patients (mean age, 80.7 years). The primary outcome was heart failure rehospitalization. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were plotted and the hazard ratios for rehospitalization were determined using Cox proportional hazards regression models. During a median follow-up period of 750 days, 58 patients underwent rehospitalization. The time from admission to mobilization was significantly longer for these patients than for those who were not rehospitalized. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses showed that the time from admission to mobilization was an independent predictor of rehospitalization, and receiver-operating characteristic analysis determined an optimal cutoff value of 3 days for differentiating the patients more likely to experience a subsequent cardiac event (sensitivity, 76%; specificity, 69%; area under the curve, 0.667). Kaplan–Meier survival curve analysis showed a significantly lower event rate in the ≤ 3-day group (p = 0.001, log-rank test). In conclusion, the time from admission to mobilization may be one of the strongest predictors of rehospitalization in elderly heart failure patients. Early mobilization within 3 days may be an initial target for the acute phase treatment of heart failure.

COVID-19 Special Column: Principles Behind the Technology for Detecting SARS-CoV-2, the Cause of COVID-19

Nationwide shortages of tests that detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have led the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to significantly relax regulations regarding COVID-19 diagnostic testing. To date the FDA has given emergency use authorization (EUA) to 48 COVID-19 in vitro diagnostic tests and 21 high complexity molecular-based laboratory developed tests, as well as implemented policies that give broad authority to clinical laboratories and commercial manufacturers in the development, distribution, and use of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. Currently, there are 2 types of diagnostic tests available for the detection of SARS-CoV-2: (1) molecular and (2) serological tests. Molecular detection of nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) sequences relating to the suspected pathogen is indicative of an active infection with the suspected pathogen. Serological tests detect antibodies against the suspected pathogen, which are produced by an individual's immune system. A positive serological test result indicates recent exposure to the suspected pathogen but cannot be used to determine if the individual is actively infected with the pathogen or immune to reinfection. In this article, the SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests currently approved by the FDA under EUA are reviewed, and other diagnostic tests that researchers are developing to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection are discussed.

Metformin and SARS-CoV-2: mechanistic lessons on air pollution to weather the cytokine/thrombotic storm in COVID-19

Pathological signaling in the lung induced by particulate matter (PM) air pollution partially overlaps with that provoked by COVID-19, the pandemic disease caused by infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Metformin is capable of suppressing one of the molecular triggers of the proinflammatory and prothrombotic processes of urban PM air pollution, namely the mitochondrial ROS/Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels (CRAC)/IL-6 cascade. Given the linkage between mitochondrial functionality, ion channels, and inflamm-aging, the ability of metformin to target mitochondrial electron transport and prevent ROS/CRAC-mediated IL-6 release might illuminate new therapeutic avenues to quell the raging of the cytokine and thrombotic-like storms that are the leading causes of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in older people. The incorporation of infection rates, severity and lethality of SARS-CoV-2 infections as new outcomes of metformin usage in elderly populations at risk of developing severe COVID-19, together with the assessment of bronchial/serological titers of inflammatory cytokines and D-dimers, could provide a novel mechanistic basis for the consideration of metformin as a therapeutic strategy against the inflammatory and thrombotic states underlying the gerolavic traits of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Correlation between arterial blood gas test and CT volumetry in patients with SARS-CoV-2 in the emergency department

• The severity of SARS-CoV-2 patients is difficult to quickly assess in the ED. • The ABG test is a quick and easy tool that can help identify more severe patients. • CT cannot be used on all suspected SARS-CoV-2 infected patients admitted in ED. • The CT volumetry correlate well with the values of severity reported by the ABG test.

Wind tunnel study of odor impact and air ventilation assessments for relocating sewage treatment works to caverns

Abstract In recent years, the topicality of environment-related issues has been frequently emphasized in terms of sustainability and the better management of development in harmony with the environment. As for Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated cities, the scarcity of land has always been assumed as a major impediment for its long-term development. Therefore, the Hong Kong government actively explores approaches to enhance usable land resources. One viable approach is rock cavern development. This paper presents a feasibility assessment of relocating a sewage treatment works to a cavern, with emphasis on the evaluation of environmental sustainability. Wind tunnel tests were carried out with efforts to estimate the prospective odor impact, as well as the wind availability at pedestrian level. It is noted that the sewage odor concentration depends greatly on the dispersion distance and the surrounding topography. The results indicate that when the sewage treatment works is relocated to the cavern, the predicted odor concentration will not cause damage to human health as long as the ventilation shaft is properly placed. In addition, the air ventilation assessments were conducted for both before/after the planned building development. It shows that the new building development at the current plant site will not significantly influence the wind availability at pedestrian level in the surrounding areas. This paper highlights the importance of sustainable development in connection with the environment, and shows that rock cavern development can be an attractive alternative for strategic urban planning in Hong Kong.

Tracking COVID-19 using online search

Research outcomes over the years have showcased the capacity of online search behaviour to model various properties of infectious diseases. In this work we use online search query frequency time series to gain insights about the prevalence of COVID-19 in multiple countries. We first develop unsupervised modelling techniques based on identified symptom categories by United Kingdom's National Health Service. We then propose ways for minimising an expected bias in these signals partially generated by the early and continuous exposure to news media. We also look into transfer learning techniques for mapping supervised models from countries where the disease spread has progressed to countries that are in earlier phases of the epidemic curve. Furthermore, we analyse the time series of online search queries in relation to confirmed COVID-19 cases data jointly across multiple countries, uncovering interesting patterns. Finally, we show results from short-term forecasting models based on Gaussian Processes that combine confirmed cases and online search data time series.

Ethics in the time of COVID: What remains the same and what is different.

The COVID-19 pandemic raises difficult ethical questions for our healthcare system and its providers. Perhaps the most difficult is how to fairly distribute scarce resources, such as ICU beds and ventilators, as the answer will determine who lives and who dies. Compounding the difficulty, all of us are experiencing the dizzying newness of our socially distanced lives, and we sense that 'things are different now.' How do our traditional ethical principles apply to these very novel circumstances?

The Prevalence of Common Respiratory Viruses in Human Lungs

Viral infections probably initiate a large percentage of childhood and adult asthmatic attacks based on a history of preceding 'cold', high rates of viral isolation during attacks with lower rates of isolation during symptom-free intervals, and peaks of hospital admissions for asthma coinciding with viral epidemics. Although PCR technology provides a much more sensitive and specific method for detecting viral nucleic acids, its role in diagnosing active viral infection has been only partially explored. The PCR screening procedure for nine common respiratory viruses was performed on lung tissue obtained from both asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients. Six additional cases (four lifetime non-smokers and two with remote minimal smoking histories) were added to control for the fact that both the asthmatics and non-asthmatics smoked heavily. Data from two viruses (the adenovirus and RSV) are used to discuss the possible role of latent and persistent viral infection in the pathogenesis of chronic lung inflammation.

Response to “Comments on "Homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein of the newly identified coronavirus may boost cross‐species transmission from snake to human” and “Codon bias analysis alone is uninformative for identifying host(s) of new virus”

We have recently reported for the first time that SARS‐CoV‐2 maybe a bat‐originated coronavirus with a recombination occurred within the spike (S) protein gene based on phylogenetic and simplot analyses(1). These two conclusions are supported by findings recently reported by others and are well accepted in the field of SARS‐CoV‐2 research(2‐4). This article is protected by copyright.

GEICAM Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Breast Cancer During Spain's COVID-19 Pandemic

Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women in Spain. During the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus, patients with BC require timely treatment and follow-up. However, not only are hospitals overwhelmed with infected patients, some patients with BC are at higher risk for infection and for serious complications if infected. Thus, health care providers need to evaluate each BC treatment and in-hospital visit to minimize pandemic-associated risks while maintaining adequate treatment efficacy. Here we present a set of guidelines regarding available options for BC patient management and treatments by BC subtype in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Owing to the lack of evidence about COVID-19 infection, these recommendations are mainly based in expert opinion, medical organizations' and societies' recommendations, and some published evidence. We consider this a useful tool to facilitate medical decision making in this health crisis situation we are facing. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This work presents a set of guidelines regarding available options for breast cancer (BC) patient management and treatments by BC subtype in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Owing to the suddenness of this health crisis, specialists have to make decisions with little evidence at hand. Thus, these expert guidelines may be a useful tool to facilitate medical decision making in the context of a worldwide pandemic with no resources to spare.

Pediatric respiratory infections by Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the most common agents of community-acquired pneumonia in children and young adults. Although M. pneumoniae is a small bacterium that can reproduce in an artificial culture medium and is known to be sensitive to certain antibiotics in vitro as well as in vivo, the immunopathogenesis of M. pneumoniae in the human host is not fully understood. The epidemiologic characteristics, including periodic epidemics, and some clinical characteristics of M. pneumoniae are similar to those observed in systemic viral infections. Many experimental and clinical studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of lung injuries in M. pneumoniae infection is associated with a cell-mediated immune reaction, including high responsiveness to corticosteroid therapy. This paper presents an overview of M. pneumoniae infections, with emphasis on epidemiology, pathogenesis and treatment.

Antibiotikatherapie in der Hals-Nasen-Ohren-Heilkunde

First, the general principles for an antibiotic therapy are stated. The indications have to be well thought through. Frequent viral ENT infections, as well as numerous bacterial infections, should not be treated with antibiotics. Due to the current antibiotic sensitivity of the main ENT pathogens, the antibiotic choice for an empiric therapy is emphasized, and also the advantage of an optimized therapy based on the results of Gram stain (supercalculated empiric therapy) and an antibiogram (specific therapy). Pus characteristics may be the first step in diagnosing the pathogens. The degree of severity of an infection determines the oral or parenteral route of administration. As a rule, antibiotic therapy has to be checked after 2–3 days. The grouping of the different ENT infections with a similar spectrum of pathogens gives a better view of the therapeutic principles and reduces repetitions. The current recommendations for antibiotic treatment of numerous ENT infections with different degrees of severity are indicated. After the presentation of the appropriate antibiotics with their current spectrum of efficacy, the initial therapy, treatment in case of penicillin allergy, and of severe cases and complications or therapeutic failure are mentioned.

Influenza A (H1N1) transmission by road traffic between cities and towns

Influenza A (H1N1) was spread widely between cities and towns by road traffic and had a major impact on public health in China in 2009. Understanding regulation of its transmission is of great significance with urbanization ongoing and for mitigation of damage by the epidemic. We analyzed influenza A (H1N1) spatiotemporal transmission and risk factors along roads in Changsha, and combined diffusion velocity and floating population size to construct an epidemic diffusion model to simulate its transmission between cities and towns. The results showed that areas along the highways and road intersections had a higher incidence rate than other areas. Expressways and county roads played an important role in the rapid development stage and the epidemic peak, respectively, and intercity bus stations showed a high risk of disease transmission. The model simulates the intensity and center of disease outbreaks in cities and towns, and provides a more complete simulation of the disease spatiotemporal process than other models.

The COVID-19 pandemic and health inequalities

This essay examines the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for health inequalities. It outlines historical and contemporary evidence of inequalities in pandemics—drawing on international research into the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918, the H1N1 outbreak of 2009 and the emerging international estimates of socio-economic, ethnic and geographical inequalities in COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. It then examines how these inequalities in COVID-19 are related to existing inequalities in chronic diseases and the social determinants of health, arguing that we are experiencing a syndemic pandemic. It then explores the potential consequences for health inequalities of the lockdown measures implemented internationally as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the likely unequal impacts of the economic crisis. The essay concludes by reflecting on the longer-term public health policy responses needed to ensure that the COVID-19 pandemic does not increase health inequalities for future generations.

Organisation de la réanimation en situation de pandémie de grippe aviaire

Résumé La survenue probable d’une pandémie grippale liée au virus H5N1 va entraîner un afflux massif de patients à l’hôpital, notamment en réanimation. Ce texte, rédigé par des experts des 7 sociétés savantes les plus impliquées, rappelle les principes généraux de l’organisation des hôpitaux en situation pandémique. Les points particuliers concernant la réanimation concernent le risque majeur de débordement et la nécessité imposée pas les autorités de tutelle d’un doublement de la capacité d’accueil. La réanimation pédiatrique semble particulièrement exposée, les jeunes enfants, particulièrement les petits nourrissons, devant être les plus affectés par les formes graves de grippe aviaire, dans le contexte actuel de pénurie relative de lits de réanimation pédiatrique. Il est donc proposé que les enfants de plus de 20kg soient admis en réanimation adulte. Il est souhaitable que les unités de réanimation néonatales restent à basse densité virale. Les services de réanimation mixtes (néonatale et pédiatrique) pourraient n’accueillir que les enfants. La baisse de la capacité d’admission en réanimation néonatale devrait amener à s’interroger sur une limitation des admissions de grands prématurés en situation de crise. Le doublement des capacités d’admission en réanimation pédiatrique pourrait se faire grâce à l’utilisation des unités de soins continus, des salles de réveil et le renforcement par du personnel, médical et non médical, libéré par les déprogrammations d’activités. Ces personnels seraient encadrés par les personnels habituels des unités. Des actions de formations spécifiques sont à mettre en œuvre pour les personnels destinés à renforcer les unités de réanimation. Summary The influenza pandemic will create a major increase in demand for hospital admissions, particularly for critical care services. The recommendations detailed herein have been elaborated by experts from medical societies potentially involved in this situation and focus on general hospital organization. Intensive care units will initially face high demand for admission; the Healthcare Authorities must therefore study how ICU capacity can be expanded. Pediatric intensive care units will be particularly affected by this situation of relative bed shortage, since young children, particularly infants, are expected to be affected by severe clinical forms of avian flu. Therefore, the weight threshold for admission to the adult ICU was lowered to 20kg. Neonatal intensive care units (NICU) should remain, if possible, low viral density areas. Mixed (neonatal and pediatric) intensive care units could be dedicated to infants and children only. NICU admission of extreme premature babies should be limited in this difficult situation. Pediatric intensive care units (PICU) admission capacity could be doubled by using intermediate care and postoperative care units. The staff could be increased by doctors and nurses involved in canceled programmed activities. Healthcare workers transferred to PICU should be given special training.

Evaluation of a Safety Awareness Group Program for Adults With Intellectual Disability.

Using a participatory research approach, we enlisted 12 U.S. Centers for Independent Living (CILs) to recruit and enroll 170 adults with intellectual disability (ID) to be randomized to either The Safety Class, an abuse prevention group program, or usual care. Participants were asked to complete pre, post, and 3-month follow-up questionnaires. CIL staff members facilitated the eight-session, interactive program. Quantitative and qualitative findings suggest that participation in a brief safety program may improve safety protective factors among men and women with ID. The Safety Class serves as one model for delivering an abuse prevention and education intervention to adults with significant safety needs but extremely limited access to relevant community resources.

Inflammatory Cytokine Modulation of Cancer Cell Proliferation

Inflammatory cytokines have a critical role in modulation of both innate and adaptive immunity in response to foreign antigen. They also play an important role in anticancer immunity. For example, they can promote cell‐mediated immunity against cancer cells. With their immunostimulatory effects, these cytokines are being tested for cancer treatment in the form of DNA vaccine or adjuvant or therapeutic cytokines. Direct effect of these cytokines on cancer cell, however, is still unclear. In this project, we investigated whether IL‐1( and IL‐18 can modulate cancer cell proliferation. We employed a simple nonradioactive proliferation (MTT) assay and detection of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to test the effect of these recombinant human cytokines on various cancer cell lines, including breast cancer cell line (MCF‐7), oral carcinoma cell line (KB), colon cancer cell line (Caco‐2) and choriocarcinoma cell line (Jar). Cytokines used in this study had both inhibitory and stimulatory effect on cell proliferation. Findings in this project could provide an insight of cancer cell response to these cytokines and this could lead to a consideration on using cytokine as immunotherapy for cancer treatment.

Data-driven modelling and prediction of COVID-19 infection in India and correlation analysis of the virus transmission with socio-economic factors

AIMS: The current study attempts to model the COVID-19 outbreak in India, USA, China, Japan, Italy, Iran, Canada and Germany. The interactions of coronavirus transmission with socio-economic factors in India using the multivariate approach were also investigated. METHODS: Actual cumulative infected population data from 15 February to May 15, 2020 was used for determination of parameters of a nested exponential statistical model, which were further employed for the prediction of infection. Correlation and Principal component analysis provided the relationships of coronavirus spread with socio-economic factors of different states of India using the Rstudio software. RESULTS: Cumulative infection and spreadability rate predicted by the model was in good agreement with the actual observed data for all countries (R(2) = 0.985121 to 0.999635, and MD = 1.2–7.76%) except Iran (R(2) = 0.996316, and MD = 18.38%). Currently, the infection rate in India follows an upward trajectory, while other countries show a downward trend. The model claims that India is likely to witness an increased spreading rate of COVID-19 in June and July. Moreover, the flattening of the cumulative infected population is expected to be obtained in October infecting more than 12 lakhs people. Indian states with higher population were more susceptible to virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: A long-term prediction of cumulative cases, spreadability rate, pandemic peak of COVID-19 was made for India. Prediction provided by the model considering most recent data is useful for making appropriate interventions to deal with the rapidly emerging pandemic.

THE PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIP OF PFIESTERIA PISCICIDA, CRYPTOPERIDINIOPSOID SP. AMYLOODINOUM OCELLATUM AND A PFIESTERIA‐LIKE DINOFLAGELLATE TO OTHER DINOFLAGELLATES AND APICOMPLEXANS

The taxonomic relationship between heterotrophic and parasitic dinoflagellates has not been studied extensively at the molecular level. In order to investigate these taxonomic relationships, we sequenced the small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA gene of Pfiesteria piscicida (Steidinger et Burkholder), a Pfiesteria‐like dinoflagellate, Cryptoperidiniopsoid sp., and Amyloodinium ocellatum (Brown) and submitted those sequences to GenBank. Pfiesteria piscicida and Cryptoperidiniopsoid sp. are heterotrophic dinoflagellates, purportedly pathogenic to fish, and A. ocellatum, a major fish pathogen, has caused extensive economic losses in both the aquarium and aquaculture industries. The pathogenicity of the Pfiesteria‐like dinoflagellate is unknown at this time, but its growth characteristics and in vitro food preferences are similar to those of P. piscicda. The SSU sequences of these species were aligned with the other full‐length dinoflagellate sequences, as well as those of representative apicomplexans and Perkinsus species, the groups most closely related to dinoflagellates. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that Cryptoperidiniopsoid sp., P. piscicida, and the Pfiesteria‐like dinoflagellate are closely related and group into the class Blastodiniphyceae, as does A. ocellatum. None of the species examined were closely related to the apicomplexans or to Perkinsus marinus, the parasite that causes “Dermo disease” in oysters. The overall phylogenetic analyses largely supported the current class and subclass groupings within the dinoflagellates.

Similarity maps and pairwise predictions for transmission dynamics of COVID-19 with neural networks

Abstract On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. Since then, many countries have experienced the rapid transmission of this respiratory disease among their populations and have exercised many strategies to mitigate the spread of this disease. The prediction of the transmission dynamics serves important roles in designing mitigation strategies. However, due to the unknown characteristics of this disease, as well as the geographical and political factors, building efficient models of the dynamics for many countries is difficult. The objective of this study is to develop a transmission dynamics predictor that takes advantage of the time differences among many countries with respect to transmission of this disease, in that some countries experienced earlier outbreaks than others. The primary novelty of the proposed method is that, unlike many existing transmission predictors that require parameters based on prior knowledge of the epidemiology of past viruses, the proposed method only requires the transmission similarities between countries in the publicly available data for this current disease. In this paper, the viability and limitations of the proposed method are reported and discussed.

Clinicopathological Phenotype of Autosomal Recessive Cholesterol Deficiency in Holstein Cattle

BACKGROUND: Cholesterol deficiency (CD), a newly identified autosomal recessive genetic defect in Holstein cattle, is associated with clinical signs of diarrhea, failure to thrive, and hypocholesterolemia. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The objective is to describe the clinicopathological phenotype of affected Holstein cattle homozygous for the causative apolipoprotein B gene (APOB) mutation. ANIMALS: Six Holstein cattle, 5 calves with a clinical history of chronic diarrhea, and 1 heifer with erosions in the buccal cavity and neurologic symptoms were admitted to the Clinic for Ruminants. METHODS: This case review included a full clinical examination, a complete blood count, blood chemistry, and measurements of cholesterol and triglycerides. The animals were euthanized and necropsied. A PCR‐based direct gene test was applied to determine the APOB genotype. RESULTS: All 6 animals were inbred, could be traced back to the sire Maughlin Storm, and were confirmed homozygous for the APOB mutation. The clinical phenotype included poor development, underweight, and intermittent diarrhea in the calves, and neurologic signs in the heifer included hypermetria and pacing. Hypocholesterolemia and low triglycerides concentrations were present in all animals. The pathological phenotype of all animals was steatorrhea with enterocytes of the small intestine containing intracytoplasmic lipid vacuoles. The peripheral nervous system of the heifer displayed degenerative changes. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Suspicion of CD in Holstein cattle is based on the presence of chronic diarrhea with no evidence of primary infections. Confirmation of the associated APOB gene mutation is needed. Additionally, the heifer demonstrated primarily signs of neurologic disease providing an unexpected phenotype of CD.

Applying graph theory to protein structures: an Atlas of coiled coils

MOTIVATION: To understand protein structure, folding and function fully and to design proteins de novo reliably, we must learn from natural protein structures that have been characterized experimentally. The number of protein structures available is large and growing exponentially, which makes this task challenging. Indeed, computational resources are becoming increasingly important for classifying and analyzing this resource. Here, we use tools from graph theory to define an Atlas classification scheme for automatically categorizing certain protein substructures. RESULTS: Focusing on the α-helical coiled coils, which are ubiquitous protein-structure and protein–protein interaction motifs, we present a suite of computational resources designed for analyzing these assemblies. iSOCKET enables interactive analysis of side-chain packing within proteins to identify coiled coils automatically and with considerable user control. Applying a graph theory-based Atlas classification scheme to structures identified by iSOCKET gives the Atlas of Coiled Coils, a fully automated, updated overview of extant coiled coils. The utility of this approach is illustrated with the first formal classification of an emerging subclass of coiled coils called α-helical barrels. Furthermore, in the Atlas, the known coiled-coil universe is presented alongside a partial enumeration of the ‘dark matter’ of coiled-coil structures; i.e. those coiled-coil architectures that are theoretically possible but have not been observed to date, and thus present defined targets for protein design. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: iSOCKET is available as part of the open-source GitHub repository associated with this work (https://github.com/woolfson-group/isocket). This repository also contains all the data generated when classifying the protein graphs. The Atlas of Coiled Coils is available at: http://coiledcoils.chm.bris.ac.uk/atlas/app.

Evaluation of pneumonia virus of mice as a possible human pathogen.

Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), a relative of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), causes respiratory disease in mice. There is serologic evidence suggesting widespread exposure of humans to PVM. To investigate replication in primates, African green monkeys (AGM) and rhesus macaques (n = 4) were inoculated with PVM by the respiratory route. Virus was shed intermittently at low levels by a subset of animals, suggesting poor permissiveness. PVM efficiently replicated in cultured human cells and inhibited the type I interferon (IFN) response in these cells. This suggests that poor replication in nonhuman primates was not due to a general nonpermissiveness of primate cells or poor control of the IFN response. Seroprevalence in humans was examined by screening sera from 30 adults and 17 young children for PVM-neutralizing activity. Sera from a single child (6%) and 40% of adults had low neutralizing activity against PVM, which could be consistent with increasing incidence of exposure following early childhood. There was no cross-reaction of human or AGM sera between RSV and PVM and no cross-protection in the mouse model. In native Western blots, human sera reacted with RSV but not PVM proteins under conditions in which AGM immune sera reacted strongly. Serum reactivity was further evaluated by flow cytometry using unfixed Vero cells infected with PVM or RSV expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a measure of viral gene expression. The reactivity of human sera against RSV-infected cells correlated with GFP expression, whereas reactivity against PVM-infected cells was low and uncorrelated with GFP expression. Thus, PVM specificity was not evident. Our results indicate that the PVM-neutralizing activity of human sera is not due to RSV- or PVM-specific antibodies but may be due to low-affinity, polyreactive natural antibodies of the IgG subclass. The absence of PVM-specific antibodies and restriction in nonhuman primates makes PVM unlikely to be a human pathogen.

COVID-19 pandemic and Zagreb earthquakes as stressors in patients with temporomandibular disorders

Stress refers to situations in which one feels that the demands imposed on them exceed the limitations of their ability to adapt. This causes a series of adverse consequences among which is compromised health (Lazarus and Folkman, 1984). On 11th March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the pandemic status of COVID-19 diseases, leading to the European Union states imposing the lockdown, Croatia being one among them. Infection prevention became the nation's most important goal, and people had to change their day-to-day habits.

The Role of TRPV4 in Regulating Innate Immune Cell Function in Lung Inflammation

Ion channels/pumps are essential regulators of innate immune cell function. Macrophages have been increasingly recognized to have phenotypic plasticity and location-specific functions in the lung. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) function in lung injury has been shown to be stimulus- and cell-type specific. In the current review, we discuss the importance of TRPV4 in macrophages and its role in phagocytosis and cytokine secretion in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Furthermore, TRPV4 controls a MAPK molecular switch from predominately c-Jun N-terminal kinase, JNK activation, to that of p38 activation, that mediates phagocytosis and cytokine secretion in a matrix stiffness-dependent manner. Expanding knowledge regarding the downstream mechanisms by which TRPV4 acts to tailor macrophage function in pulmonary inflammatory diseases will allow for formulation of novel therapeutics.

Innate Immune Sensing and Response to Influenza

Influenza viruses pose a substantial threat to human and animal health worldwide. Recent studies in mouse models have revealed an indispensable role for the innate immune system in defense against influenza virus. Recognition of the virus by innate immune receptors in a multitude of cell types activates intricate signaling networks, functioning to restrict viral replication. Downstream effector mechanisms include activation of innate immune cells and, induction and regulation of adaptive immunity. However, uncontrolled innate responses are associated with exaggerated disease, especially in pandemic influenza virus infection. Despite advances in the understanding of innate response to influenza in the mouse model, there is a large knowledge gap in humans, particularly in immunocompromised groups such as infants and the elderly. We propose here, the need for further studies in humans to decipher the role of innate immunity to influenza virus, particularly at the site of infection. These studies will complement the existing work in mice and facilitate the quest to design improved vaccines and therapeutic strategies against influenza.

European consensus recommendations for neonatal and paediatric retrievals of positive or suspected COVID-19 patients

BACKGROUND: The 2020 novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) pandemic necessitates tailored recommendations addressing specific procedures for neonatal and paediatric transport of suspected or positive COVID-19 patients. The aim of this consensus statement is to define guidelines for safe clinical care for children needing inter-facility transport while making sure that the clinical teams involved are sufficiently protected from SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A taskforce, composed of members of the European Society of Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care (ESPNIC) Transport section and the European Society for Paediatric Research (ESPR), reviewed the published literature and used a rapid, two-step modified Delphi process to formulate recommendations regarding safety and clinical management during transport of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The joint taskforce consisted of a panel of 12 experts who reached an agreement on a set of 17 recommendations specifying pertinent aspects on neonatal and paediatric COVID-19 patient transport. These included: case definition, personal protective equipment, airway management, equipment and strategies for invasive and non-invasive ventilation, special considerations for incubator and open stretcher transports, parents on transport and decontamination of transport vehicles. CONCLUSIONS: Our consensus recommendations aim to define current best-practice and should help guide transport teams dealing with infants and children with COVID-19 to work safely and effectively. IMPACT: We present European consensus recommendations on pertinent measures for transporting infants and children in times of the coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2 /COVID-19) pandemic. A panel of experts reviewed the evidence around transporting infants and children with proven or suspected COVID-19. Specific guidance on aspects of personal protective equipment, airway management and considerations for incubator and open stretcher transports is presented. Based on scant evidence, best-practice recommendations for neonatal and paediatric transport teams are presented, aiming for the protection of teams and patients. We highlight gaps in knowledge and areas of future research.

Coronavirus S protein-induced fusion is blocked prior to hemifusion by Abl kinase inhibitors.

Enveloped viruses gain entry into host cells by fusing with cellular membranes, a step that is required for virus replication. Coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), fuse at the plasma membrane or use receptor-mediated endocytosis and fuse with endosomes, depending on the cell or tissue type. The virus spike (S) protein mediates fusion with the host cell membrane. We have shown previously that an Abelson (Abl) kinase inhibitor, imatinib, significantly reduces SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viral titres and prevents endosomal entry by HIV SARS S and MERS S pseudotyped virions. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are classified as BSL-3 viruses, which makes experimentation into the cellular mechanisms involved in infection more challenging. Here, we use IBV, a BSL-2 virus, as a model for studying the role of Abl kinase activity during coronavirus infection. We found that imatinib and two specific Abl kinase inhibitors, GNF2 and GNF5, reduce IBV titres by blocking the first round of virus infection. Additionally, all three drugs prevented IBV S-induced syncytia formation prior to the hemifusion step. Our results indicate that membrane fusion (both virus-cell and cell-cell) is blocked in the presence of Abl kinase inhibitors. Studying the effects of Abl kinase inhibitors on IBV will be useful in identifying the host cell pathways required for coronavirus infection. This will provide an insight into possible therapeutic targets to treat infections by current as well as newly emerging coronaviruses.

Host gene expression profiles in ferrets infected with genetically distinct henipavirus strains

Henipavirus infection causes severe respiratory and neurological disease in humans that can be fatal. To characterize the pathogenic mechanisms of henipavirus infection in vivo, we performed experimental infections in ferrets followed by genome-wide gene expression analysis of lung and brain tissues. The Hendra, Nipah-Bangladesh, and Nipah-Malaysia strains caused severe respiratory and neurological disease with animals succumbing around 7 days post infection. Despite the presence of abundant viral shedding, animal-to-animal transmission did not occur. The host gene expression profiles of the lung tissue showed early activation of interferon responses and subsequent expression of inflammation-related genes that coincided with the clinical deterioration. Additionally, the lung tissue showed unchanged levels of lymphocyte markers and progressive downregulation of cell cycle genes and extracellular matrix components. Infection in the brain resulted in a limited breadth of the host responses, which is in accordance with the immunoprivileged status of this organ. Finally, we propose a model of the pathogenic mechanisms of henipavirus infection that integrates multiple components of the host responses.

New Technique: Acute Minced Expansion Graft of Traumatic Wound Tissue.

OBJECTIVES Superficial soft tissue injury, such as a skin tear, is common. For such wounds, the authors introduce a novel technique that allows the physician to salvage otherwise discarded tissue as a traumatic graft to highly accelerate wound healing. METHODS A series of 11 patients with superficial soft tissue trauma in which debrided tissues are salvaged back into the wound by means of minced expansion grafting (MEG) are followed from presentation through healing. RESULTS Salvaged tissue replaced back into wounds as MEG grafts greatly accelerated epithelialization and wound closure. CONCLUSIONS Based on their experience with MEG, the authors introduce a new principle for the wound surgeon that no tissue should ever be discarded, but rather salvaged and placed back into the wound.

Sialic Acid Binding Properties of Soluble Coronavirus Spike (S1) Proteins: Differences between Infectious Bronchitis Virus and Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus

The spike proteins of a number of coronaviruses are able to bind to sialic acids present on the cell surface. The importance of this sialic acid binding ability during infection is, however, quite different. We compared the spike protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and the spike protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Whereas sialic acid is the only receptor determinant known so far for IBV, TGEV requires interaction with its receptor aminopeptidase N to initiate infection of cells. Binding tests with soluble spike proteins carrying an IgG Fc-tag revealed pronounced differences between these two viral proteins. Binding of the IBV spike protein to host cells was in all experiments sialic acid dependent, whereas the soluble TGEV spike showed binding to APN but had no detectable sialic acid binding activity. Our results underline the different ways in which binding to sialoglycoconjugates is mediated by coronavirus spike proteins.

Contemporary and Future Concepts on Hypertension in African Americans: COVID-19 and Beyond

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease related mortality is the leading cause of death in the United States, with hypertension being the most prevalent and potent risk factor. For decades hypertension has disproportionately affected African Americans, who also have a higher burden of associated comorbidities including diabetes and heart failure. METHODS: Current literature including guideline reports and newer studies on hypertension in African Americans in PubMed were reviewed. We also reviewed newer publications on the relationship between COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease. FINDINGS: While APOL1 has been theorized in the epidemiology of hypertension, the increased prevalence and associated risks are primarily due to environmental and lifestyle factors. These factors include poor diet, adverse lifestyle, and social determinants. Hypertension control can be achieved by lifestyle modifications such as low sodium diet, weight loss, and adequate physical activity. When lifestyle modifications alone do not adequately control hypertension, a common occurrence among African Americans who suffer with greater prevalence of resistant hypertension, pharmacological intervention is indicated. The efficacy of renal denervation, and the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 and aminopeptidase A inhibitors, have been studied for treatment of resistant hypertension. Furthermore, the recent COVID-19 crisis has been particularly devastating among African Americans who demonstrate increased incidence and poorer health outcomes related to the disease. CONCLUSION: The disparities in outcomes, which are largely attributable to a greater prevalence of comorbidities such as hypertension and obesity, in addition to adverse environmental and socioeconomic factors, highlight the necessity of specialized clinical approaches and programs for African Americans to address longstanding barriers to equitable care.

COVID-19 gone bad: A new character in the spectrum of the hyperferritinemic syndrome?

Abstract The severe form of COVID-19 share several clinical and laboratory features with four entities gathered under the term “hyperferritinemic syndrome” and including macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome (CAPS) and septic shock. COVID-19 systemic inflammatory reaction and “hyperferritinemic syndromes” are all characterized by high serum ferritin and a life-threatening hyper-inflammation sustained by a cytokines storm which eventually leads to multi-organ failure. In this review, we analyze the possible epidemiological and molecular mechanisms responsible for hyper-inflammation in patients with severe COVID-19 and we underline the similarities between this condition and “hyperferritinemic syndromes” which would allow considering this entity as the fifth member of the spectrum of inflammatory conditions.

Reactivities of 4 murine coronavirus antigens with immunized or naturally infected rat sera by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.

Four murine coronavirus antigens, sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) strain TG, Parker's rat coronavirus (PCV) strain 8190, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains S and NuU, were examined for their reactivities to hyperimmunized and naturally infected rat sera by ELISA. With the immunized sera, SDAV and PCV antigens reacted best with respective homologous sera. MHV antigens reacted with all antisera, anti-SDAV, anti-PCV, and anti-MHV-S at approximately the same level, and MHV-S showed a slightly higher reactivity than MHV-NuU. The reactivities of the sera from various colonies to these antigens were in the order--from high to low--of SDAV, MHV-S, MHV-NuU, and PCV. None of sera negative for SDAV antigen reacted positively to the other antigens. Within the sera positive for SDAV, the positivities were in the order of MHV-S, MHV-NuU, and PCV. These results suggested that, although homologous antigens are best to detect SDAV or PCV infection by ELISA, MHV antigen can be used if highly cross-reactive viral strain is selected.

Fish as bioindicators: coal and mercury pollution in Colombia's ecosystems

Mining in Colombia affects 488,672 ha (298,391 in coal mining and 190,281 in gold mining). However, Colombia has insufficient studies on mining and its repercussions, which limits estimates of mining impacts on ecosystems and the human population. Due to the rise of mining activities in Colombia, the negative impacts generated by coal and Hg will also continue to increase. This review analyzes national information levels on coal and Hg in island/coastal/marine as well as freshwater ecosystems and human groups using fishery resources as a framework. This is because fish are the main source of animal protein in marine coastal-island and mainland communities. Here, 15 of 32 Colombian departments have records on total mercury (THg) in water, sediments, fish, and human communities. Around 205 ton/year of mercury is discharged into the ecosystem. In human hair for example (15.3 to 50.15 µg/g), mercury exceeds the international maximum levels allowed (ILA) and the national standard (5.0 µg/g). Mercury levels in freshwater fish show 3.3 µg/g of THg and levels in marine and coastal-island fish are 1.2 µg/g THg exceeding the ILA (0.5 µg/g) standard for fish that will be consumed. Carnivorous species have a THg between 0.04 and 2.55 µg/g suggesting bioaccumulation and magnification of heavy metals. These findings were then compared with available international information.

Mining Semantic Descriptions of Bioinformatics Web Resources from the Literature

A number of projects (myGrid, BioMOBY, etc.) have recently been initiated in order to organise emerging bioinformatics Web Services and provide their semantic descriptions. They typically rely on manual curation efforts. In this paper we focus on a semi-automated approach to mine semantic descriptions from the bioinformatics literature. The method combines terminological processing and dependency parsing of journal articles, and applies information extraction techniques to profile Web services using informative textual passages, related ontological annotations and service descriptors. Service descriptors are terminological phrases reflecting related concepts (e.g. tasks, approaches, data) and/or specific roles (e.g. input/output parameters, etc.) of the associated resource classes (e.g. algorithms, databases, etc.). They can be used to facilitate subsequent manual description of services, but also for providing a semantic synopsis of a service that can be used to locate related services. We present a case-study involving full text articles from the BMC Bioinformatics journal. We illustrate the potential of natural language processing not only for mining descriptions of known services, but also for discovering new services that have been described in the literature.

Coronavirus: Why Men are More Vulnerable to Covid-19 Than Women?

Amid of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, much emphasis was initially placed on the elderly or those who have preexisting health conditions such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes as being at high risk of contracting and/or dying of Covid-19. But it is now becoming clear that being male is also a factor. The epidemiological findings reported across different parts of the world indicated higher morbidity and mortality in males than females. While it is still too early to determine why the gender gap is emerging, this article point to several possible factors such as higher expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE 2; receptors for coronavirus) in male than female, sex-based immunological differences driven by sex hormone and X chromosome. Furthermore, a large part of this difference in number of deaths is caused by gender behavior (lifestyle), i.e., higher levels of smoking and drinking among men compared to women. Lastly, studies reported that women had more responsible attitude toward the Covid-19 pandemic than men. Irresponsible attitude among men reversibly affect their undertaking of preventive measures such as frequent handwashing, wearing of face mask, and stay at home orders.

Transurethral removal of a cystic urolith in a mare using a laparoscopic specimen pouch.

CASE REPORT Cystic urolithiasis is the most common form of urolithiasis reported in horses. In contrast to the gelding or stallion, clinical disease is less common in the mare and manual removal techniques are possible because of their shorter, wider urethral anatomy. However, these manual removal techniques can be traumatic and are limited by the size of the urolith. This report describes the use of a commercial laparoscopic specimen pouch to remove a cystic urolith in a mare. CONCLUSION This approach may allow the extraction of larger uroliths per urethra in the mare, while affording some protection to the mucosa of the bladder neck and urethra.

Analysis of the infection status of the health care workers in Wuhan during the COVID-19 outbreak: A cross-sectional study

BACKGROUND: Health care workers at the frontline are facing a substantial risk of infection during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. METHODS: We acquired information and data on the general information, infection and death status of health care workers in Wuhan during the COVID-19 outbreak and completed statistical analyses. RESULTS: We have obtained the data on 2,457 infected cases among health care workers in Wuhan, China. More than half of the infected individuals were nurses (52.06%), while 33.62% of infected cases were doctors and 14.33% of cases were medical staff. In particular, the case infection rate of nurses (2.22%) was remarkably higher than that of doctors (1.92%). Most infected cases among health care workers were female (72.28%). A majority of the infected health care workers (89.26%) came from general hospitals, followed by specialized hospitals (5.70%) and community hospitals (5.05%). The case infection rate of health care workers (2.10%) was dramatically higher than that of non-health care workers (0.43%). The case fatality rate of health care workers (0.69%) was significantly lower than that of non-health care workers (5.30%). CONCLUSIONS: The infection risk of HCWs is clearly higher than that of non-HCWs. HCWs play an essential role in fighting the pandemic. The analysis of the infection status of HCWs is essential to attract enough attention from the public, provide effective suggestions for government agencies and improve protective measures for HCWs.

Challenges in Abdominal Organ Transplantation During the COVID-19 Pandemic

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic, abdominal organ transplantation programs are currently facing multiple challenges. Transplant candidates and recipients are considered high-risk populations for severe disease and death due to COVID-19 as a result of their numerous underlying comorbidities, advanced age and impaired immune function. Emerging reports of atypical and delayed clinical presentations in these patients generate further concerns for widespread disease transmission to medical personnel and the community. The striking similarities between COVID-19 and other outbreaks that took place over the past two decades, like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, highlight the severity of the situation and dictate that extra measures should be taken by the transplant programs to avoid adverse outcomes. Transplant organizations are currently calling for strict screening and isolation protocols to be established in all transplant programs, for both organ donors and recipients. As the situation escalates, more radical measures might be necessary, including a temporary hold on non-urgent transplantations, resulting in serious ethical dilemmas between the survival of these patients and the safety of the community. Further data about these special populations could result in more individualized guidelines for abdominal organ transplantation in the era of COVID-19.

Let us unite against COVID-19 - a New Zealand perspective

Novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has shaken the existence of mankind worldwide, including that of New Zealand. In comparison to other countries, New Zealand has had a very low number of confirmed and probable cases as well as COVID-19-related deaths. New Zealand closed its borders and rapidly declared a stringent lockdown to eliminate COVID-19. The country's 'go hard, go early' policy serves as an exemplar for the rest of the world to date. The mysterious nature of COVID-19 has caused tremendous stress and uncertainty leading to universal conflict between public health and state economy. Mental health services and non-government organisations have been proactive in the fight against COVID-19. Though there has been no significant rise in referrals to secondary mental health services to date (4 May 2020), a rapid surge in mental health presentations is widely anticipated. Telehealth may prove to be an efficient and cost-effective tool for the provision of future health services.

Psychosocial correlates of safe sex communication between Latina women and their stable male partners: an integrative review.

Latina women in stable relationships have risks for human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted infections. Improving safe sexual communication (SSC) could enable women to accurately assess and mitigate their risk of infection within their relationship. Literature to identify psychosocial correlates that facilitate or inhibit SSC between Latina women and their partners has not yet been synthesized. The purpose of this study was to conduct an integrative review and synthesis of empirical and theoretical research that examines psychosocial correlates of SSC among adult Latina women from the United States, Latina America, and the Caribbean with stable male partners. A systematic search of LILACS, EBSCO, and PsychInfo databases was conducted to identify qualitative and quantitative studies that investigated psychosocial correlates of SSC among adult Latina women with a stable male partner. Pertinent data were abstracted and quality of individual studies was appraised. A qualitative synthesis was conducted following Miles and Huberman's method. Five qualitative and three quantitative studies meet eligibility criteria. Factors related to SSC related to three main themes: (1) relationship factors such as length, quality, and power/control, (2) individual factors including attitudes, beliefs, background, behaviors, and intrapersonal characteristics, and (3) partner factors related to partner beliefs and behaviors. The interplay of relationship, individual, and partner factors should be considered in the assessment of SSC for Latina women with their stable partners. To inform future interventions and clinical guidelines, additional research is needed to identify which factors are most related to SSC for this population, and how comparable experiences are for Latina women of different subcultures and living in different countries.

Fitting Community-Centered Population Health (CCPH) Into the Existing Health Care Delivery Patchwork: The Politics of CCPH

The COVID-19 crisis has nakedly exposed the problems and huge holes in the health care system of the United States. For today, we need to address the current pandemic from the point of view of both control and suppression. But such efforts could also provide insights into a post-pandemic restructuring of health care. If one or several states succeed in addressing the COVID pandemic together with an associated modest economic resurgence, citizens could develop the trust in state leadership necessary to finally make fundamental changes in our health care system. Such change is a once in a century opportunity.

When Both Markets and Governments Fail Health.

This paper presents the rationale and motivation for countries and the global development community to tackle a critical set of functions in the health sector that appear to be under-prioritized and underfunded. The recent eruptions of Ebola outbreaks in Africa and other communicable diseases like Zika and SARS elsewhere led scientific and medical commissions to call for global action. The calls for action motivated the World Health Organization (WHO) to respond by defining a new construct within the health sector: Common Good for Health (CGH). While the starting point for developing the CGH construct was the re-emergence of communicable diseases, it extends to additional outcomes resulting from failures to act and finance within and outside the health sector. This paper summarizes global evidence on failures to address CGHs effectively, identifies potential reasons for the public and private sectors' failures to respond, and lays out the first phase of the WHO program as represented by the papers in this special issue of Health Systems & Reform.

Real-time probe measurement of tissue oxygenation during gastrointestinal stapling: mucosal ischemia occurs and is not influenced by staple height.

BACKGROUND Tension, ischemia, and technical error are factors leading to anastomotic complications such as leak, stricture, and ulceration with bleeding. Currently, surgeons evaluate tissue ischemia without any simple routine measurement technique. A new tissue surface probe, T-Stat 303, provides continuous measurement of tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation (StO(2)) and may have clinical utility for intraoperative assessment of blood flow in areas of surgical anastomosis. This pilot study aimed to determine local StO(2) during gut stapling using various staple sizes for the purpose of assessing the tool's ability to measure changes and the reproducibility of those changes with stapling. METHODS Measurements were made in nine anesthetized adult swine during laparotomy. Various staple heights were used to transect small bowel and colon. Serosal and mucosal surface measurements were obtained at baseline and on each side of the transection using the T-Stat device adjacent to the staple line and 2 cm away from it. RESULTS Both small bowel and colon mucosal StO(2) adjacent to the staple line showed significant ischemia compared with baseline (p < 0.001) and 2 cm away from the staple line (p < 0.001) using all staple heights. The serosa of both small bowel and colon adjacent to the staple line was not significantly different from baseline serosa (p > 0.11) except when the grey stapler was used (baseline, 58 +/- 6.6 vs. staple line, 51 +/- 15.1; p = 0.022). The baseline mucosa of the small bowel and colon did not differ from mucosa 2 cm away from the staple line (p > 0.08). The small bowel serosa 2 cm away from the staple line did not differ from baseline mucosa, whereas the colon serosa 2 cm away significantly increased after stapling compared with baseline mucosa (p < 0.012). No statistically significant StO(2) difference was found between the various staple load sizes. CONCLUSION Mucosal ischemia occurs after gastrointestinal stapling and is not affected by various staple heights. The T-Stat probe provides a real-time method for assessment of gut ischemia by surgeons during surgical procedures.

Adding Colchicine to the Antiretroviral Medication - Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra) in Hospitalized Patients with Non-Severe Covid-19 Pneumonia: A Structured Summary of a Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial

OBJECTIVES: Colchicine is a well-known drug, which has been used for years to treat a wide range of rheumatic and inflammatory disorders. It helps break the cycle of inflammation through diverse mechanisms including reducing Intereukin-6, Interleukin-8, Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha besides controlling oxidative stress pathways which all are important and pathologic components in the clinical course and outcome of patients infected with COVID-19. This study aims to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of colchicine in non-severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients. TRIAL DESIGN: Prospective, randomized (1:1 ratio), double blind study with parallel group design. PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized patients with positive nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 infection (RT -PCR) and lung Computed tomography scan involvement compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia. The patients are not severely hypoxic, do not need intubation or invasive oxygenation. Exclusion criteria: known hypersensitivity to colchicine; known hepatic failure; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)<30 ml/min/1.73m(2) (by the CKD-EPI Creatinine Equation for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) which estimates GFR based on serum creatinine. ; kidney transplant recipients, using Digoxin, QTc >450 msec. Participants will be recruited from inpatients at Labbafinejad Meidcal Center , Tehran, Iran. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Eligible enrolled patients will be randomized into two groups. Group A will receive the antiretroviral Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra) while group B will receive Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra) + Colchicine 1.5 mg loading then 0.5 mg twice daily orally. All patients in both groups will receive the same amounts of essential minerals, vitamins as antioxidants, and antibiotics. Patients of both groups will be treated under optimal treatment based on the CDC and WHO guidelines and national consensus proposed in Iran including the same dosages of Lopinavir/Ritonavir, antibiotics, trace elements and antioxidants while only in group-B patients Colchicine will be added on top of this protocol. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary: Time for clinical improvement and lung CT score changes 14 days after treatment. Secondary: 14 days after treatment – C-Reactive Protein test x Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio , Interleukin-6, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels reduction – Percentage of patients who require supplemental Oxygen – Mean hospital stay length RANDOMISATION: Patients will be allocated to each group (ratio 1:1) by using an online randomization tool: http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/index.cfm BLINDING (MASKING): This will be a double-blind study in which participants and those assessing the final outcomes will be blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Regarding the pandemic crisis and our center capacity to hospitalize confirmed COVID-19 patients, a total of 80 patients was found to be logical to be randomized into two groups of 40- patients. TRIAL STATUS: Recruitment is ongoing. Recruitment began on 20/03/2020 and the date by which the recruitment is anticipated to be completed is 30/05/2020.

Virus Morphogenesis in the Cell: Methods and Observations

Viruses carry out many of their activities inside cells, where they synthesise proteins that are not incorporated into viral particles. Some of these proteins trigger signals to kidnap cell organelles and factors which will form a new macro-structure, the virus factory, that acts as a physical scaffold for viral replication and assembly. We are only beginning to envisage the extraordinary complexity of these interactions, whose characterisation is a clear experimental challenge for which we now have powerful tools. Conventional study of infection kinetics using virology, biochemistry and cell biology methods can be followed by genome-scale screening and global proteomics. These are important new technologies with which we can identify the cell factors used by viruses at different stages in their life cycle. Light microscopy, electron microscopy and electron tomography, together with labelling methods for molecular mapping in situ, show immature viral intermediates, mature virions and recruited cell elements in their natural environment. This chapter describes how these methods are being used to understand the cell biology of viral morphogenesis and suggests what they might achieve in the near future.

Periodontal pockets: A potential reservoir for SARS-CoV-2?

Periodontal pockets are the major clinical manifestation of Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory oral disease affecting the teeth-supporting tissues and has high prevalence in the adult population. Periodontal pockets are ideal environments for subgingival bacterial biofilms, that interact with the supragingival oral cavity, mucosal tissues of the pocket and a peripheral circulatory system. Periodontal pockets have been found to harbor viral species such as the Herpes simplex viruses' family. Recently, the SARS-CoV-2 has gained major interest of the scientific/medical community as it caused a global pandemic (Covid-19) and paralyzed the globe with high figures of infected people worldwide. This virus behavior is still partially understood, and by analyzing some of its features we hypothesized that periodontal pocket could be a favorable anatomical niche for the virus and thus acting as a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2.

Multiple novel astrovirus species in human stool.

Diarrhoea remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries where numerous cases remain without identified aetiology. Astroviruses are a recently identified cause of animal gastroenteritis which currently includes two species suspected of causing human diarrhoea. Using pan-astrovirus RT-PCR, we analysed human stool samples from different continents for astrovirus-related RNA sequences. We identified variants of the two known human astrovirus species plus, based on genetic distance criteria, three novel astrovirus species all distantly related to mink and ovine astroviruses, which we provisionally named HMOAstV species A-C. The complete genome of species A displayed all the conserved characteristics of mammalian astroviruses. Each of the now three groups of astroviruses found in human stool (HAstV, AstV-MLB and HMOAstV) were more closely related to animal astroviruses than to each other, indicating that human astroviruses may periodically emerge from zoonotic transmissions. Based on the pathogenic impact of their closest phylogenetic relatives in animals, further investigations of the role of HMOAstV, so far detected in Nigeria, Nepal and Pakistan, in human gastroenteritis are warranted.

Monitoring von Organfunktionen: Dysfunktion von Niere, Leber, Gastrointestinaltrakt und Gerinnung

Monitoring of organ function is one of the core tasks of intensive care medicine. Although various monitoring devices and parameters have already been established for some organs, there are no or only few conditionally useful parameters or scores available for the kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and blood coagulation. Therefore, specific biomarkers and scores as well as combinations of both are currently investigated for better monitoring of these organs. This article gives a critical overview of currently used as well as investigational biomarkers, tests and scores in general, and shows some examples of the implications for common diseases, clinical situations and constellations in the intensive care unit.

Immediate and Delayed Procedural Stroke or Death in Stenting Versus Endarterectomy for Symptomatic Carotid Stenosis.

Background and Purpose- Stenting for symptomatic carotid stenosis (carotid artery stenting [CAS]) carries a higher risk of procedural stroke or death than carotid endarterectomy (CEA). It is unclear whether this extra risk is present both on the day of procedure and within 1 to 30 days thereafter and whether clinical risk factors differ between these periods. Methods- We analyzed the risk of stroke or death occurring on the day of procedure (immediate procedural events) and within 1 to 30 days thereafter (delayed procedural events) in 4597 individual patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis who underwent CAS (n=2326) or CEA (n=2271) in 4 randomized trials. Results- Compared with CEA, patients treated with CAS were at greater risk for immediate procedural events (110 versus 42; 4.7% versus 1.9%; odds ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.9-3.8) but not for delayed procedural events (59 versus 46; 2.5% versus 2.0%; odds ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.9-1.9; interaction P=0.006). In patients treated with CAS, age increased the risk for both immediate and delayed events while qualifying event severity only increased the risk of delayed events. In patients treated with CEA, we found no risk factors for immediate events while a higher level of disability at baseline and known history of hypertension were associated with delayed procedural events. Conclusions- The increased procedural stroke or death risk associated with CAS compared with CEA was caused by an excess of events occurring on the day of procedure. This finding demonstrates the need to enhance the procedural safety of CAS by technical improvements of the procedure and increased operator skill. Higher age increased the risk for both immediate and delayed procedural events in CAS, mechanisms of which remain to be elucidated. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov .

The Role of Immune Complexes Consisting of Myelin Basic Protein (MBP), Anti‐MBP Antibodies and Complement in Promoting CD4(+) T‐cell Responses to MBP in Health and Multiple Sclerosis

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune condition characterized by degeneration of nerve fibre myelin sheets. A candidate autoantigen, myelin basic protein (MBP), has especially attracted attention. The presence of anti‐MBP antibodies is a predictor of definite MS, but their role in the pathogenesis remains obscure. T cells have long been known to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of MS. Recently, an important role for B cells as autoantigen‐presenting cells has been demonstrated in other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. The uptake of MBP by B cells and the presentation of MBP‐derive peptides to T helper (Th) cells by B cells may be promoted by the formation of complement (C) activating immune complexes (ICs) between MBP and natural autoantibodies in healthy individuals and disease‐associated anti‐MBP antibodies in MS patients, respectively. We have investigated the formation of MBP‐containing IC, the binding of MBP to B cells, the MBP‐elicited induction of Th‐cell and B‐cell proliferation and the cytokine production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors grown in the presence of intact or C‐inactivated serum from healthy donors or patients with MS. While MBP did not induce measurable proliferation of B cells nor CD4(+) T cells, we observed the production of TNF‐α, IFN‐γ and IL‐10 by PBMC in response to incubation with MBP in the presence of sera from healthy controls as well as sera from MS patients. By contrast, no production of IL‐2, IL‐4 and IL‐5 was detected. We are currently investigating the capability of MS sera to promote the formation of MBP‐containing IC and thereby enhance the cytokine responses, by virtue of elevated anti‐MBP contents.

Effectiveness of a new tunneled catheter in preventing catheter malfunction: a comparative study.

PURPOSE To compare infection and malfunction rates of two different types of antimicrobial-eluting tunneled cuffed catheters (TCCs) for hemodialysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS The HemoSplit TCC with BioBloc (silver sulfadiazine) coating (n = 100, control group) and the Tal Palindrome Ruby TCC, which has a novel silver antimicrobial sleeve and a spiral-z tip design (n = 100, study group), were compared in this case-controlled study. The main endpoints were TCC infection and malfunction. RESULTS Primary-assisted TCC patency was significantly reduced with the BioBloc TCC (71% and 61% at 90 and 180 days, respectively) compared with the Palindrome Ruby TCC (94% at 90 and 180 days, P < .0001). Multivariate analysis identified only the BioBloc TCC and common femoral access site as independent predictors of worse patency. The unadjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval) for TCC dysfunction with the BioBloc compared with the Palindrome Ruby was 6.0 (2.33-15.53, P < .001), and the relative risk adjusted for access site was 3.2 (1.71-11.96, P = .002). The infection-free rates of the two TCC types were similar (P = .36). The reintervention-free rate for infection or malfunction was significantly better with the Palindrome Ruby TCC (76% and 58% at 90 and 180 days, respectively) than with the BioBloc TCC (60% and 45% at 90 and 180 days, respectively; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS The results support the use of the Palindrome Ruby TCC on the basis of the significantly lower thrombosis and reintervention rate; randomized trials are justified to confirm this finding and to evaluate its role in the prevention of TCC infection.

ADAMs and ADAMTSs

Proteolysis has emerged as a key post-translational regulator of the function of molecules on the cell surface and in the extracellular milieu. In principle, proteolysis can activate or inactivate a substrate, or can change its functional properties. ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) and ADAMTS (a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease domain with thrombospondin type 1 repeats) proteases are related members of a superfamily of metallo-endopeptidases that also includes MMPs and astacins. ADAMs are integral membrane proteins that typically cleave other membrane anchored proteins, whereas ADAMTS proteases lack a membrane anchor, and process both cell-surface and secreted molecules, the latter mostly extracellular matrix (ECM) components. ADAMs are implicated in fertilization, neurogenesis, in regulating the function of ligands for the EGF-receptor, and in the release of proteins such as the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα from the plasma membrane. ADAMTS proteases have key roles in embryonic development, including lung development, the molecular maturation of von Willebrand factor and procollagen as well as organization of fibrillin microfibrils in ECM, and are implicated in the pathogenesis of diverse lung and airway disorders. Here, we provide a general overview of the biochemical properties and physiological functions of ADAMs and ADAMTS proteases and describe their relevance to lung and airway disorders.

Computational identification of biologically functional non-hairpin GC-helices in human Argonaute mRNA

BACKGROUND: Perfectly formed duplex elements in RNA occur within folding units, often as a part of hairpin motifs which can be reliably predicted by various RNA folding algorithms. Double helices with consecutive Watson-Crick base-pairing may also be formed between distant RNA segments thereby facilitating long-range interactions of long-chain RNA that may be biologically functional. Here we addressed the potential formation of RNA duplex motifs by long-range RNA-RNA interactions of distantly located matching sequence elements of a single long-chain RNA. RESULTS: We generated a Python-based software tool that identifies consecutive RNA duplex elements at any given length and nucleotide content formed by distant sequences. The software tool, dubbed RNAslider, is built on the theoretical RNA structure prediction algorithm Mfold. Source code and sample data sets are available on demand. We found that a small ratio of human genes including the Argonaute (Ago)-like gene family encode mRNAs containing highly GC-rich non-hairpin duplex elements (GC-helix) of equal to or more than 8 base pairs in length and we provide experimental evidence for their biological significance. CONCLUSION: GC-helices are observed preferentially within the 5(′)-region of mRNAs in an evolutionarily conserved fashion indicating their potential biological role. This view is supported experimentally by post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression of a fusion transcript containing 5(′)-sequences of human mRNA(Ago2) harbouring GC-helices and down-stream coding sequences of Renilla luciferase.

In vitro protective efficacy of Lithium chloride against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infection

Abstract Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyopneumoniae) infection affects the swine industry. Lithium chloride (LiCl), is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder and has also shown activity against bacterial and viral infections. Herein, we evaluated the antibacterial activity of LiCl on PK-15 cells infected with M. hyopneumoniae. Incubation of LiCl (40mM) with cells for 24h, did not significantly affect the cell viability. The qRT–PCR showed ~80% reduction in M. hyopneumoniae genome when LiCl added post-infection. A direct effect of LiCl on bacteria was also observed. However, treatment of cells with LiCl prior infection, does not protect against the infection. Anti-bacterial activity of LiCl was further confirmed by IFA, which demonstrated a reduction in the bacterial protein. With 40mM LiCI, the apoptotic cell death, production of nitric oxide and superoxide anion induced by M. hyopneumoniae, were prevented by ~80%, 60% and 58% respectively. Moreover, caspase-3 activity was also reduced (82%) in cells treated with 40mM LiCl. LiCl showed activity against various strains of M. hyopneumoniae examined in our study. Collectively, our data showed that LiCl inhibited the infection of M. hyopneumoniae through anti-apoptotic mechanism.

Type I interferon protects neurons from prions in in vivo models

Infectious prions comprising abnormal prion protein, which is produced by structural conversion of normal prion protein, are responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. Prions are infectious agents that do not possess a genome and the pathogenic protein was not thought to evoke any immune response. Although we previously reported that interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) was likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of prion diseases, suggesting the protective role of host innate immune responses mediated by IRF3 signalling, this remained to be clarified. Here, we investigated the reciprocal interactions of type I interferon evoked by IRF3 activation and prion infection and found that infecting prions cause the suppression of endogenous interferon expression. Conversely, treatment with recombinant interferons in an ex vivo model was able to inhibit prion infection. In addition, cells and mice deficient in type I interferon receptor (subunit interferon alpha/beta receptor 1), exhibited higher susceptibility to 22L-prion infection. Moreover, in in vivo and ex vivo prion-infected models, treatment with RO8191, a selective type I interferon receptor agonist, inhibited prion invasion and prolonged the survival period of infected mice. Taken together, these data indicated that the interferon signalling interferes with prion propagation and some interferon-stimulated genes might play protective roles in the brain. These findings may allow for the development of new strategies to combat fatal diseases.

Emergence of multidrug-resistant non-fermentative gram negative bacterial infection in hospitalized patients in a tertiary care center of Nepal

OBJECTIVE: This study was designed for the characterization and establishment of antibiotic susceptibility profiles of non-fermentative gram negative bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients in a tertiary care hospital of Nepal. RESULTS: A total of 402 non-fermentative gram negative bacteria was isolated in 1486 culture-positive cases from 6216 different clinical samples obtained from hospitalized patients. Among total non-fermentative gram negative bacterial isolates, the highest number was recovered from specimens collected from lower respiratory tract infections (n = 173, 43.0%) of hospitalized patients followed by pus/swab samples (n = 99, 24.6%) and urinary tract infections (n = 49, 12.2%). The most common non-fermentative gram negative bacteria identified were Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 177, 44.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 161, 40.1%) and Burkholderia cepacia complex (n = 33, 8.2%). These bacterial isolates exhibited a higher rate of insusceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. On the other hand, all the isolates of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii were completely susceptible to colistin sulfate and polymyxin B. Among total isolates, 78.1% (n = 314) were multidrug-resistant with a high rate of multidrug-resistant among A. baumannii (91.0%).

Public Response to Community Mitigation Measures for Pandemic Influenza

We report the results of a national survey conducted to help public health officials understand the public’s response to community mitigation interventions for a severe outbreak of pandemic influenza. Survey results suggest that if community mitigation measures are instituted, most respondents would comply with recommendations but would be challenged to do so if their income or job were severely compromised. The results also indicate that community mitigation measures could cause problems for persons with lower incomes and for racial and ethnic minorities. Twenty-four percent of respondents said that they would not have anyone available to take care of them if they became sick with pandemic influenza. Given these results, planning and public engagement will be needed to encourage the public to be prepared.

Ultrafast physical bacterial inactivation and photocatalytic self-cleaning of ZnO nanoarrays for rapid and sustainable bactericidal applications

Various nanostructured surfaces have been developed recently to physically inactivate bacteria, for reducing the rapidly spreading threat of pathogenic bacteria. However, it generally takes several hours for these surfaces to inactivate most of the bacteria, which greatly limits their application in the fields favoring rapid bactericidal performance. Besides, the accumulated bacteria debris left on these surfaces is rarely discussed in the previous reports. Herein we report the nanotip-engineered ZnO nanoarrays (NAs) with ultrafast physical bactericidal rate and the ability to photocatalytically remove the bacteria debris. Neither chemical (Zn2+ or reactive oxygen species) nor photocatalytic effect leads to the ultrafast bactericidal rate, where 97.5% of E. coli and 94.9% of S. aureus are inactivated within only 1 min. The simulation analysis further supported our proposed mechanism attributing the ultrafast bactericidal activity to the great stress enabled by the uneven topography. Moreover, the re-exposure of the ZnO NAs nanotips can be achieved in only 10 min under a mild UV light source. This study not only presents an ultrafast physical bactericidal activity, but also demonstrates the potential of the recyclable and photocatalytic self-cleaning functions of theses surfaces for applications that desire rapid and sustainable bactericidal performance.

Review: Delivering mental health support within schools and colleges - a thematic synthesis of barriers and facilitators to implementation of indicated psychological interventions for adolescents.

BACKGROUND Increasing the role of schools and colleges in the provision of mental health services for young people has the potential to improve early intervention and access to treatment. We aimed to understand what factors influence the successful implementation of indicated psychological interventions within schools and colleges to help guide increased provision of mental health support within education settings. METHODS Systematic search for studies that have reported barriers or facilitators to the implementation of indicated interventions for adolescent emotional disorders delivered within schools and further education/sixth form colleges (CRD42018102830). Databases searched were EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, British Nursing Index, ASSIA, ERIC and British Education Index. A thematic synthesis of factors reported to impact implementation was conducted. RESULTS Two thousand five hundred and sixty-nine records and 177 full texts were screened. Fifty studies were identified for inclusion, all of which were of school-based interventions. Eleven analytic themes were developed encompassing intervention characteristics, organisational capacity, training and technical assistance, provider characteristics and community-level factors. Findings indicate the need to select appropriate interventions, consider logistical challenges of the school context and provide training and supervision to enable staff to deliver interventions with fidelity. However, structural and environmental support is required for these facilitators to have the greatest impact on successful implementation. CONCLUSIONS Implementing indicated school-based mental health interventions is challenging. Those involved in planning school-based mental health initiatives must be alert to the impact of factors on multiple interacting levels. There is a lack of research on implementing mental health support within further education and sixth form colleges. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE Increased utilisation of schools and colleges as a setting for early intervention has been proposed as a means of improving access to mental health treatment, but successful implementation of mental health interventions within educational settings is challenging. Based on a synthesis of current evidence, we recommend that young people and education professionals should be involved in the selection of school-based interventions to ensure they are acceptable and practical to deliver within the logistical constraints of the school environment. Those delivering interventions within schools, as well as staff involved in identifying young people who might benefit from these interventions, must receive high-quality ongoing training and support. Senior school leaders play an important role in championing mental health interventions and developing a school culture that prioritises mental well-being. Health and education policy should be designed to promote a cross-sector focus on the emotional health of young people. There is a lack of evidence on the implementation of indicated psychological interventions within sixth form and further education colleges.

Prevention and Treatment of Influenza, Influenza-Like Illness, and Common Cold by Herbal, Complementary, and Natural Therapies.

In recent years viral respiratory tract infections, especially influenza viruses, have had a major impact on communities worldwide as a result of unavailability of effective treatment or vaccine. The frequent alterations in the antigenic structures of respiratory viruses, particularly for RNA viruses, pose difficulties in production of effective vaccines. The unavailability of optimal medication and shortage of effective vaccines suggests the requirement for alternative natural therapies. Several herbal remedies were used for prevention and treatment viral respiratory illnesses. Among those that were found effective included maoto, licorice roots, antiwei, North American ginseng, berries, Echinacea, plants extracted carnosic acid, pomegranate, guava tea, and Bai Shao. There is scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of several complementary therapies for colds. Oral zinc may reduce the length and severity of a cold. Taking vitamin C supplements on a regular basis only slightly reduces the length and severity of colds. Probiotics were found better than placebo in reducing the number episodes of acute upper respiratory tract infections, the rate of episodes of acute upper respiratory tract infection and reducing antibiotic use. Alkaline diets or drinks might have antiviral properties as in vitro studies demonstrated inactivation effect of alkaline medium on respiratory virus. Earthing might have a natural anti-inflammatory effect for human body. It is now accepted that an overwhelming inflammatory response is the cause of human deaths from avian H5N1 influenza infection. Earthing accelerates immune response following vaccination, as demonstrated by increases of gamma globulin concentration. No in vivo or clinical studies were found that investigate the role of alkalization or earthing on respiratory viral infections. Thus, future studies are recommended to reveal any potential curative effects.

Biological function through network topology: a survey of the human diseasome

Molecular network data are increasingly becoming available, necessitating the development of well performing computational tools for their analyses. Such tools enabled conceptually different approaches for exploring human diseases to be undertaken, in particular, those that study the relationship between a multitude of biomolecules within a cell. Hence, a new field of network biology has emerged as part of systems biology, aiming to untangle the complexity of cellular network organization. We survey current network analysis methods that aim to give insight into human disease.

Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) associated with severe acute pancreatitis: Case report on three family members

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Abdominal pain is one of the known symptoms associated with coronavirus disease 2019. Little is known about the development of acute pancreatitis as a complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. This case report describes the presentation of acute pancreatitis in two of three family members with severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Data were collected from three family members admitted with COVID-19 to the intensive care unit in March 2020. This study was reviewed and approved by the local data and ethics committee (31-1521-253). RESULTS: Two of the three family members were diagnosed with acute pancreatitis associated with SARS-CoV-2. Other causes of acute pancreatitis were excluded for both patients (including alcohol, biliary obstruction/gall stones, drugs, trauma, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia, and hypotension). CONCLUSIONS: These cases highlight acute pancreatitis as a complication associated with COVID-19 and underlines the importance of measuring pancreas-specific plasma amylase in patients with COVID-19 and abdominal pain.

Introduction: What Is This Volume About?

In these early years of the twenty-first century, it can often seem that across the globe we are living in a world of crisis. When we began this book, there were bombings at the end of the Boston Marathon of 2013, an army coup in Egypt that overthrew the first democratically elected government, an armed conflict in Syria, the President of North Korea made bellicose threats against South Korea and the USA , and the shrinking of the Arctic ice sheet that was implicated in the extreme winter weather that the UK has faced in 2012–2013. ‘The war on terror’, the age of austerity, global warming and consequent climatic instability, disparities in wealth, and other issues add to the sense that social institutions are unable to cope with the major problems that the world faces. It is certainly the case, on the one hand, that states around the world are under enormous fiscal pressure, in large part brought about by the banking failures of 2008, which heralded the end of a long period of conspicuous consumption and an era of deregulation. On the other hand, the private sector, too, is under pressure, losing once-certain markets to new competitors, and ‘fat cat’ directors facing angry shareholders and governments seeking to curb their excess salaries and the bonus culture of those in charge of large corporations.

COVID‐19 in a patient with pre‐existing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), newly discovered since December 2019(Chen et al, 2020; Guan et al, 2020; Lu et al, 2020). According to WHO situation report (<https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports>) on 1 April, 2020, a total of 823626 cases and over 40000 death had been documented globally, rapidly evolving into a pandemic. As reported by previous studies, patients with pre-existing health conditions are more likely to progress to severe COVID-19 pneumonia(Guan et al, 2020; Huang et al, 2020; Yang et al, 2020; Zhao et al, 2020b). Here we report a COVID-19 case with pre-existing acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL).

The Impact of Circular Stapler Size on the Incidence of Cervical Anastomotic Stricture After Esophagectomy.

BACKGROUND Cervical anastomotic stricture after esophagectomy is a serious complication that adversely affects postoperative recovery, nutritional status and quality of life. Cervical anastomosis by a circular stapler (CS) has been widely accepted as a simple and convenient method, but anastomotic strictures are likely to occur. The aim of this study was to investigate an association between CS size and the incidence of anastomotic stricture after cervical esophagogastric anastomosis performed by a CS. METHODS Between April 2011 and March 2016, 236 consecutive patients underwent cervical esophagogastric anastomosis by a CS via a retrosternal route after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. These patients were divided into according to CS size for the procedure as follows: small-sized (25 mm) CS group (SG, n = 116) and large-sized (28 or 29 mm) CS group (LG, n = 120). The clinical data of patients were analyzed retrospectively to compare the two groups. RESULTS Overall, anastomotic strictures were observed in 90 patients (38%). The incidence of anastomotic stricture was significantly lower in the LG than the SG (23% vs. 53%, p < 0.001) (Table 3). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD: FEV1.0% <70%) (OR 2.35, 95% CI = 1.09-5.14; p = 0.029), anastomotic leakage (OR 8.97, 95% CI = 2.69-41.30; p < 0.001), and a small-sized CS (OR 3.42, 95% CI = 1.82-6.62; p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for anastomotic stricture in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS If possible, a large-sized CS should be used to prevent cervical anastomotic strictures when performing cervical anastomoses by CS.

Exercise-based rehabilitation for major non-communicable diseases in low-resource settings: a scoping review.

Introduction While there is substantial evidence for the benefits of exercise-based rehabilitation in the prevention and management of non-communicable disease (NCD) in high-resource settings, it is not evident that these programmes can be effectively implemented in a low-resource setting (LRS). Correspondingly, it is unclear if similar benefits can be obtained. The objective of this scoping review was to summarise existing studies evaluating exercise-based rehabilitation, rehabilitation intervention characteristics and outcomes conducted in an LRS for patients with one (or more) of the major NCDs. Methods The following databases were searched from inception until October 2018: PubMed/Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and trial registries. Studies on exercise-based rehabilitation for patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer or chronic respiratory disease conducted in an LRS were included. Data were extracted with respect to study design (eg, type, patient sample, context), rehabilitation characteristics (eg, delivery model, programme adaptations) and included outcome measures. Results The search yielded 5930 unique citations of which 60 unique studies were included. Study populations included patients with cardiovascular disease (48.3%), diabetes (28.3%), respiratory disease (21.7%) and cancer (1.7%). Adaptations included transition to predominant patient-driven home-based rehabilitation, training of non-conventional health workers, integration of rehabilitation in community health centres, or triage based on contextual or patient factors. Uptake of adapted rehabilitation models was 54%, retention 78% and adherence 89%. The majority of the outcome measures included were related to body function (65.7%). Conclusions The scope of evidence suggests that adapted exercise-based rehabilitation programmes can be implemented in LRS. However, this scope of evidence originated largely from lower middle-income, urban settings and has mostly been conducted in an academic context which may hamper extrapolation of evidence to other LRS. Cost-benefits, impact on activity limitations and participation restrictions, and subsequent mortality and morbidity are grossly understudied.

Tunnelled tensor fascia lata flap for complex abdominal wall reconstruction.

This study describes the treatment of two patients with recurrent, infected abdominal wall defects using bilateral delayed and tunnelled pedicled tensor fascia lata (TFL) myofascial flaps. TFL flaps were elevated and delayed for 4 weeks in both cases. In the second case, Parietex Composite mesh was positioned underneath the TFL flap and allowed to incorporate. After a delay of 4 weeks, the flaps were harvested and tunnelled subcutaneously to repair the abdominal wall defect. Both patients have stable repairs but had donor site seromas requiring drainage. Cadaver dissection was also performed to identify structures related to TFL flap harvest. We identified a variant of lateral femoral cutaneous nerve that traversed the TFL flap, necessitating meticulous dissection during surgery. In summary, we describe a new technique of incorporating mesh into the TFL prior to flap harvest for reconstruction of complex abdominal wall.

What Does Plant-Based Vaccine Technology Offer to the Fight against COVID-19?

The emergence of new pathogenic viral strains is a constant threat to global health, with the new coronavirus strain COVID-19 as the latest example. COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has quickly spread around the globe. This pandemic demands rapid development of drugs and vaccines. Plant-based vaccines are a technology with proven viability, which have led to promising results for candidates evaluated at the clinical level, meaning this technology could contribute towards the fight against COVID-19. Herein, a perspective in how plant-based vaccines can be developed against COVID-19 is presented. Injectable vaccines could be generated by using transient expression systems, which offer the highest protein yields and are already adopted at the industrial level to produce VLPs-vaccines and other biopharmaceuticals under GMPC-processes. Stably-transformed plants are another option, but this approach requires more time for the development of antigen-producing lines. Nonetheless, this approach offers the possibility of developing oral vaccines in which the plant cell could act as the antigen delivery agent. Therefore, this is the most attractive approach in terms of cost, easy delivery, and mucosal immunity induction. The development of multiepitope, rationally-designed vaccines is also discussed regarding the experience gained in expression of chimeric immunogenic proteins in plant systems.

The Antigenome: From Protein Subunit Vaccines to Antibody Treatments of Bacterial Infections?

New strategies are needed to master infectious diseases. The so-called “passive vaccination”, i.e., prevention and treatment with specific antibodies, has a proven record and potential in the management of infections and entered the medical arena more than 100 years ago. Progress in the identification of specific antigens has become the hallmark in the development of novel subunit vaccines that often contain only a single immunogen, frequently proteins, derived from the microbe in order to induce protective immunity. On the other hand, the monoclonal antibody technology has enabled biotechnology to produce antibody species in unlimited quantities and at reasonable costs that are more or less identical to their human counterparts and bind with high affinity to only one specific site of a given antigen. Although, this technology has provided a robust platform for launching novel and successful treatments against a variety of devastating diseases, it is up till now only exceptionally employed in therapy of infectious diseases. Monoclonal antibodies engaged in the treatment of specific cancers seem to work by a dual mode; they mark the cancerous cells for decontamination by the immune system, but also block a function that intervenes with cell growth. The availability of the entire genome sequence of pathogens has strongly facilitated the identification of highly specific protein antigens that are suitable targets for neutralizing antibodies, but also often seem to play an important role in the microbe’s life cycle. Thus, the growing repertoire of well-characterized protein antigens will open the perspective to develop monoclonal antibodies against bacterial infections, at least as last resort treatment, when vaccination and antibiotics are no options for prevention or therapy. In the following chapter we describe and compare various technologies regarding the identification of suitable target antigens and the foundation of cognate monoclonal antibodies and discuss their possible applications in the treatment of bacterial infections together with an overview of current efforts.

Characterisation of the bovine enteric calici-like virus, Newbury agent 1.

The bovine enteric calici-like virus, Newbury agent 1 (NA1) was characterised to determine if it is a member of the Caliciviridae and to establish its antigenic relationship to the established bovine enteric calicivirus Newbury agent 2 (NA2). Solid phase immune electron microscopy (SPIEM) allowed quantification of NA1 virions and identification of faecal samples with optimal virus levels. NA1 particles were 36.6 nm in diameter, had an indefinite surface structure resembling that of human small round structured viruses (SRSVs), and a buoyant density of 1.34 g ml(-1). A single capsid protein of 49.4 kDa was detected by Western blotting in purified NA1 preparations prepared from post-infection but not pre-infection faecal samples and with post- but not pre-infection sera. NA1 was antigenically unrelated to the bovine enteric calicivirus NA2 by SPIEM. These properties were consistent with classification of NA1 within the Caliciviridae but demonstrated heterogeneity in the capsid composition of bovine enteric caliciviruses.

A purified recombinant baculovirus expressed capsid protein of a new astrovirus provides partial protection to runting–stunting syndrome in chickens

Abstract A new viral sequence likely belonging to a virus of the family Astroviridae was determined using the gut content of chickens affected with the runting–stunting syndrome (RSS) in chickens. Since the appropriate virus could not be isolated in cell culture the open reading frame of the viral capsid protein was cloned to generate a recombinant baculovirus. The protein was purified and used as an experimental vaccine in broiler breeders to provide maternal derived antibodies for the protection of the offspring. The presence of specific antibodies was monitored by an ELISA. The offspring of vaccinated breeder hens were partially protected in a RSS challenge model.

Embroidered archimedean spiral electrodes for contactless prosthetic control.

With continuous advancements on active prosthetics the detection of the user's intention becomes the new technological bottleneck. While electromyography (EMG) is widely used to detect individual muscular contributions, sweat and relative sensor movements degrade the quality of the signal over time. In this paper, we bypass the problems created with the skin contact analyzing the muscular activation with Archimedean Spiral (AS) electrodes. We compare traditional EMG electrodes with AS electrodes, stacked up in textile embroidered layers to improve their functionality, and eventually adding a layer of cloth/silicon between the electrodes and the human skin to ascertain the feasibility of the method. We use n=9 volunteers to perform a loaded wrist extension and record signals from the extensor digitorum muscle group. We evaluate the amplitude and noise from all results and conclude that the AS electrode is capable of detecting muscular activation without touching the skin. As part of a low-cost prosthetic initiative, this EMG alternative can be potentially embedded to the prosthetic socket to improve usage and reduce adaptation problems.

Unsupervised Ensemble of Ranking Models for News Comments Using Pseudo Answers

Ranking comments on an online news service is a practically important task, and thus there have been many studies on this task. Although ensemble techniques are widely known to improve the performance of models, there is little types of research on ensemble neural-ranking models. In this paper, we investigate how to improve the performance on the comment-ranking task by using unsupervised ensemble methods. We propose a new hybrid method composed of an output selection method and a typical averaging method. Our method uses a pseudo answer represented by the average of multiple model outputs. The pseudo answer is used to evaluate multiple model outputs via ranking evaluation metrics, and the results are used to select and weight the models. Experimental results on the comment-ranking task show that our proposed method outperforms several ensemble baselines, including supervised one.

Consensus of Chinese experts on protection of skin and mucous membrane barrier for health-care workers fighting against coronavirus disease 2019

Health professions preventing and controlling Coronavirus Disease 2019 are prone to skin and mucous membrane injury, which may cause acute and chronic dermatitis, secondary infection and aggravation of underlying skin diseases. This is a consensus of Chinese experts on protective measures and advice on hand-cleaning- and medical-glove-related hand protection, mask- and goggles-related face protection, UV-related protection, eye protection, nasal and oral mucosa protection, outer ear, and hair protection. It is necessary to strictly follow standards of wearing protective equipment and specification of sterilizing and cleaning. Insufficient and excessive protection will have adverse effects on the skin and mucous membrane barrier. At the same time, using moisturizing products is highly recommended to achieve better protection.

Enteric Infectious Disease in Neonates: Epidemiology, Pathogenesis, and a Practical Approach to Evaluation and Therapy

There are many bacterial and viral pathogens that have been associated with enteric disease during the newborn period. These pathogens have widely different mechanisms of action on the intestinal epithelium and are associated with a spectrum of clinical findings. Infected infants can be asymptomatic, have gastroenteritis, or have a fulminant sepsis picture. To determine therapy and institute appropriate infection control measures requires the ability to recognize the clinical syndrome and correctly interpret laboratory results. All of these principles can be applied to the premature infant in the neonatal intensive care nursery as well as the full-term infant at home.

Analysis of Intraviral Protein-Protein Interactions of the SARS Coronavirus ORFeome

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome is predicted to encode 14 functional open reading frames, leading to the expression of up to 30 structural and non-structural protein products. The functions of a large number of viral ORFs are poorly understood or unknown. In order to gain more insight into functions and modes of action and interaction of the different proteins, we cloned the viral ORFeome and performed a genome-wide analysis for intraviral protein interactions and for intracellular localization. 900 pairwise interactions were tested by yeast-two-hybrid matrix analysis, and more than 65 positive non-redundant interactions, including six self interactions, were identified. About 38% of interactions were subsequently confirmed by CoIP in mammalian cells. Nsp2, nsp8 and ORF9b showed a wide range of interactions with other viral proteins. Nsp8 interacts with replicase proteins nsp2, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14, indicating a crucial role as a major player within the replication complex machinery. It was shown by others that nsp8 is essential for viral replication in vitro, whereas nsp2 is not. We show that also accessory protein ORF9b does not play a pivotal role for viral replication, as it can be deleted from the virus displaying normal plaque sizes and growth characteristics in Vero cells. However, it can be expected to be important for the virus-host interplay and for pathogenicity, due to its large number of interactions, by enhancing the global stability of the SARS proteome network, or play some unrealized role in regulating protein-protein interactions. The interactions identified provide valuable material for future studies.

Short Peptide Vaccine Design and Development: Promises and Challenges

Vaccine development for viral diseases is a challenge where subunit vaccines are often ineffective. Therefore, the need for alternative solutions is crucial. Thus, short peptide vaccine candidates promise effective answers under such circumstances. Short peptide vaccine candidates are linear T-cell epitopes (antigenic determinants that are recognized by the immune system) that specifically function by binding human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles of different ethnicities (including Black, Caucasian, Oriental, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, American Indian, Australian aboriginal, and mixed ethnicities). The population-specific allele-level HLA sequence data in the public IMGT/HLA database contains approximately 12542 nomenclature defined class I (9437) and class II (3105) HLA alleles as of March 2015 present in several ethnic populations. The bottleneck in short peptide vaccine design and development is HLA polymorphism on the one hand and viral diversity on the other hand. Hence, a crucial step in its design and development is HLA allele-specific binding of short antigen peptides. This is usually combinatorial and computationally labor intensive. Mathematical models utilizing structure-defined pockets are currently available for class I and class II HLA-peptide-binding peptides. Frameworks have been developed to design protocols to identify the most feasible short peptide cocktails as vaccine candidates with superantigen properties among known HLA supertypes. This approach is a promising solution to develop new viral vaccines given the current advancement in T-cell immuno-informatics, yet challenging in terms of prediction efficiency and protocol development.

Does the 5-Aminosalicylate Concentration Correlate with the Efficacy of Oral 5-Aminosalicylate and Predict Response in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease? A Systematic Review.

BACKGROUND Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA, mesalazine) is the first choice therapeutic agent for treating mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). Unfortunately a significant group of patients fail to respond. Therapeutic drug monitoring might help to maintain or induce remission by providing a tool for optimization of 5-ASA therapy. However, plasma and urine concentrations of 5-ASA reflect systemic uptake and are not useful to evaluate therapeutic effect. OBJECTIVES To explore if mucosal and faecal 5-ASA values correlate with disease activity and/or therapeutic effects in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, especially UC. METHOD We identified studies that analysed 5-ASA in faeces or mucosa of humans using an oral 5-ASA formulation, using PubMed and Embase. RESULTS In total, 39 studies (n = 939) were included, 27 on faecal 5-ASA, 9 on mucosal concentrations, and 3 on both faecal and mucosal values. We included 33 cross-sectional studies, 3 randomised clinical trials, 2 longitudinal cohorts and 1 randomized cross-over study. Mucosal 5-ASA concentrations in healthy subjects and patients on equivalent doses of 5-ASA were not found to differ remarkably. In the sub-analysis of mucosal 5-ASA concentrations in patients with active or quiescent UC, a higher concentration was seen during remission. Faecal concentrations were associated with 5-ASA doses but not with disease activity. Differences in faecal or mucosal 5-ASA values could not be ascribed to different 5-ASA formulations. CONCLUSIONS An increase of the mucosal 5-ASA concentrations was observed during remission in patients with UC. No clear relationship between the faecal 5-ASA excretion and the therapeutic efficacy was identified.

Knowledge and attitudes of medical staff in Chinese psychiatric hospitals regarding COVID-19

Abstract On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus COVID-19 a pandemic. There are patients in psychiatric hospitals in China who have been infected with COVID-19, however, the knowledge and attitudes of psychiatric hospital staff towards infectious diseases and their willingness to work during the COVID-19 outbreak has not yet been investigated. This study was performed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of medical staff in two Chinese mental health centers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We included 141 psychiatrists and 170 psychiatric nurses in the study. We found that during the COVID-19 epidemic, 89.51% of the medical staff of the psychiatric hospitals studied had extensive knowledge of COVID-19, and 64.63% of them received the relevant training in hospitals. Furthermore, about 77.17% of participants expressed a willingness to care for psychiatric patients suffering from COVID-19 virus infection. Independent predictors of willingness to care for patients included advanced training and experience of caring for patients with COVID-19. In conclusion, this study suggests that increased attention should be paid to the knowledge and attitudes of medical staff at psychiatric hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Are chilblain‐like acral skin lesions really indicative of COVID‐19? A prospective study and literature review

Recently, young COVID‐19 patients have presented with erythematous and purpuric acral lesions similar to chilblains(1–3). Despite the scarcity of published cases, this topic has attracted significant mass media attention.(4) Dermatologists have noted that more people than would be expected at this time of year are seeking medical attention for these chilblain‐like lesions. Some have suggested that people presenting with this manifestation should be tested and isolated(2). Determining the accuracy of this association is therefore crucial. To establish the real prevalence of COVID‐19 in patients with acral skin lesions, we firstly evaluated all the cases of acral lesions presented in dermatology and paediatrics departments and family doctors’ offices in an eastern Spanish region over a three‐week period. Then we prospectively performed a SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirates taken from all available patients to determine whether their cutaneous manifestations were predictive of a positive result. To put our findings into context, we reviewed all the articles published before May 2020 concerning COVID‐19 patients with cutaneous lesions. We evaluated 58 patients, whose characteristics are summarized in Table 1. In most cases, lesions were chilblain‐like. Fifteen patients had already been tested, and only one had a positive result: an 85‐year‐old man admitted for severe Covid‐19 pneumonia. He had an ulcer on a toe that was finally determined to be vascular in nature. We performed prospective PCR testing in 24 patients. All test results were negative. In total, then, PCR was negative in 38 patients and positive in a single patient whose lesion was very unlikely to be due to COVID‐19. Our bibliography search returned 97 articles and we found 2 more through cross‐references. Nine of these articles dealt with acral lesions specifically. Their results are summarized in Table 2. Data published in the literature are heterogeneous, as are the methods employed to collect them. The first papers looked at cutaneous manifestations in patients with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.(5–8) This approach cannot reveal whether this dermatologic manifestation is a specific marker of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, since patients without COVID‐19 are not included. The other approach, which we have followed, is to analyse all patients with acral lesions. This can be done retrospectively, reporting on patients in the sample who have already been tested, or prospectively, performing the test on all available patients, regardless of whether they have symptoms. The retrospective method has a significant risk of confounding bias: due to the scarcity of COVID‐19 tests(8), they are usually reserved for patients with COVID‐19‐related symptoms, who are obviously more likely to test positive. All previous studies including only patients with cutaneous acral lesions (summarized in table 2) have been retrospective, and only a minority of patients were tested. In total, 12 out of at least 49 tested patients were positive (24.5%). Combined with our results, they total 13 positives out of 88 tests (14.8%). There are two possible explanations for the high proportion of negative results: I) A high number of false negatives. II) The lesions are not related to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The low prevalence of an infected contact in our sample, after three weeks of strict confinement in Spain, makes the possibility of being infected in our cohort less likely. The diffusion of this entity by the mass media may have caused patients who would not normally consult to do so.(9) . Other possible explanations include a concomitant parvovirus B19 outbreak(10) or trauma‐induced lesions. Our study suggests that acral skin lesions are not a specific marker of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Although larger prospective studies are needed, current evidence indicates that acral skin lesions should not be regarded as a sign of COVID‐19 in otherwise asymptomatic patients.

[COVID-19 and kidney disease].

Acute kidney injury (AKI), albuminuria and hematuria are common in Covid-19 and have been shown to increase mortality. Assessment with a urinary dipstick and creatinine at admission should be completed with a urinary sediment and quantification of albuminuria if positive. SARS-Cov-2 seems to enter and infect the endothelium and kidney cells, and contributes to damage in addition to hypercoagulability, multi organ failure and hyperinflammation. Underhydration and rhabdomyolysis can contribute to acute tubular necrosis. Anti-inflammatory treatment may be considered and discussed with a nephrologist. Treatment with ACEi/ARBs should be continued if possible.

Efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir or arbidol in adult patients with mild/moderate COVID-19: an exploratory randomized controlled trial

Abstract Background Antiviral therapies against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which has caused a global pandemic of respiratory illness called COVID-19, are still lacking. Methods Our study (NCT04252885, named ELACOI), was an exploratory randomized (2:2:1) controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or arbidol monotherapy for treating patients with mild/moderate COVID-19. Findings This study successfully enrolled 86 patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 with 34 randomly assigned to receive LPV/r, 35 to arbidol and 17 with no antiviral medication as control. Baseline characteristics of the three groups were comparable. The primary endpoint, the rate of positive-to-negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, was similar between groups (all P>0.05). There were no differences between groups in the secondary endpoints, the rates of antipyresis, cough alleviation, or improvement of chest CT at days 7 or 14 (all P>0.05). At day 7, eight (23.5%) patients in the LPV/r group, 3 (8.6%) in the arbidol group and 2(11.8%) in the control group showed a deterioration in clinical status from moderate to severe/critical (P =0.206). Overall, 12 (35.3%) patients in the LPV/r group and 5 (14.3%) in the arbidol group experienced adverse events during the follow-up period. No apparent adverse event occurred in the control group. Conclusions LPV/r or arbidol monotherapy present little benefit for improving the clinical outcome of patients hospitalized with mild/moderate COVID-19 over supportive care. Funding This study was supported by project 2018ZX10302103-002, 2017ZX10202102-003-004 and Infectious Disease Specialty of Guangzhou High-level Clinical Key Specialty (2019-2021).

The basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan is about to die out, how about the rest of the World?

The virologically confirmed cases of a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the world are rapidly increasing, leading epidemiologists and mathematicians to construct transmission models that aim to predict the future course of the current pandemic. The transmissibility of a virus is measured by the basic reproduction number ( R0 ), which measures the average number of new cases generated per typical infectious case. This review highlights the articles reporting rigorous estimates and determinants of COVID-19 R0 for the most affected areas. Moreover, the mean of all estimated R0 with median and interquartile range is calculated. According to these articles, the basic reproduction number of the virus epicentre Wuhan has now declined below the important threshold value of 1.0 since the disease emerged. Ongoing modelling will inform the transmission rates seen in the new epicentres outside of China, including Italy, Iran and South Korea.

Synthetic biology for bioengineering virus‐like particle vaccines

Vaccination is the most effective method of disease prevention and control. Many viruses and bacteria that once caused catastrophic pandemics (e.g., smallpox, poliomyelitis, measles, and diphtheria) are either eradicated or effectively controlled through routine vaccination programs. Nonetheless, vaccine manufacturing remains incredibly challenging. Viruses exhibiting high antigenic diversity and high mutation rates cannot be fairly contested using traditional vaccine production methods and complexities surrounding the manufacturing processes, which impose significant limitations. Virus‐like particles (VLPs) are recombinantly produced viral structures that exhibit immunoprotective traits of native viruses but are noninfectious. Several VLPs that compositionally match a given natural virus have been developed and licensed as vaccines. Expansively, a plethora of studies now confirms that VLPs can be designed to safely present heterologous antigens from a variety of pathogens unrelated to the chosen carrier VLPs. Owing to this design versatility, VLPs offer technological opportunities to modernize vaccine supply and disease response through rational bioengineering. These opportunities are greatly enhanced with the application of synthetic biology, the redesign and construction of novel biological entities. This review outlines how synthetic biology is currently applied to engineer VLP functions and manufacturing process. Current and developing technologies for the identification of novel target‐specific antigens and their usefulness for rational engineering of VLP functions (e.g., presentation of structurally diverse antigens, enhanced antigen immunogenicity, and improved vaccine stability) are described. When applied to manufacturing processes, synthetic biology approaches can also overcome specific challenges in VLP vaccine production. Finally, we address several challenges and benefits associated with the translation of VLP vaccine development into the industry.

Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite... Contamine? Estimating the impact of French municipal elections on COVID-19 spread in France

On March 15, about 20,000,000 voters cast their vote for the first round of the 2020 French municipal elections. We investigate the extent to which this event contributed to the COVID-19 epidemics in France. To this end, we first predict each departement's own dynamics using information up to the election to calibrate a standard logistic model. We then take advantage of electoral turnout differences between departements to distinguish the impact of the election on prediction errors in hospitalizations from that of simultaneously implemented anti-contagion policies. We report a detrimental effect of the election in locations that were at relatively advanced stages of the epidemics by the time of the election. In contrast, we show that the election did not contribute to the epidemics in departements with lower infection levels by March 15. All in all, our estimates suggest that elections accounted for about 4,000 excess hospitalizations by the end of March, which represents 15% of all hospitalizations by this time. They also suggest that holding elections in June may not be as detrimental.

Targeting deubiquitinase USP28 for cancer therapy

As one of the most important post-translational modifications, ubiquitination plays versatile roles in cancer-related pathways, and is involved in protein metabolism, cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, and transcription. Counteracting the activities of the E3 ligases, the deubiquitylating enzymes have been suggested as another important mechanism to modulate the ubiquitination process, and are implicated in cancer as well. In this article, we review the emerging roles of USP28 in cancer pathways as revealed by recent studies. We discuss the major mechanisms by which USP28 is involved in the cancer-related pathways, whereby USP28 regulates physiological homeostasis of ubiquitination process, DNA-damage response, and cell cycle during genotoxic stress. We further review the studies where USP28 was targeted for treating multiples cancers including non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, intestinal cancers, gliomas, and bladder cancer. As a result, the clinical significance of targeting USP28 for cancer therapy merits further exploration and demonstration.

Battling the COVID-19 Pandemic: Is Bangladesh Prepared?

Following detection of the first few COVID-19 cases in early March, Bangladesh has stepped up its efforts to strengthen capacity of the healthcare system to avert a crisis in the event of a surge in the number of cases. This paper sheds light on the preparedness of the healthcare system by examining the spatial distribution of isolation beds across districts and divisions, forecasting the number of ICU units that may be required in the short term and analyzing the availability of frontline healthcare workers to combat the pandemic. As of April 18, COVID-19 cases have been found in 53 of the 64 districts in Bangladesh with Dhaka District being the epicenter. Seventy-five percent of the cases have been identified in 5 neighboring districts, namely, Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur, Narsingdi and Kishoreganj, which appear to form a spatial cluster. However, if one takes into account the population at risk, the prevalence appears to be highest in Narayanganj, followed by Dhaka, Gazipur, Narsingdi and Munshiganj. These regions may therefore be flagged as the COVID-19 hotspots in Bangladesh. Among the eight divisions, prevalence is highest in Dhaka Division followed by Mymensingh and Barishal. The number of cases per million exceeds the number of available isolation beds per million in the major hotspots indicating that there is a risk of the healthcare system becoming overwhelmed should the number of cases rise. This is especially true for Dhaka Division, where the ratio of COVID-19 patients to doctors appears to be alarmingly high. Mymensingh Division also has a disproportionately small number of doctors relative to the number of COVID-19 patients. Using second order polynomial regression, the analysis predicts that even if all ICU beds are allocated to COVID-19 patients, Bangladesh may run out of ICU beds soon after May 4, 2020. We conclude that in spite of a significant increase in hospital capacity during 2005-15 and a 57% rise in the number of doctors during the same period, the healthcare system in Bangladesh and Dhaka Division in particular, may not be fully prepared to handle the COVID-19 crisis. Thus, further steps need to be taken to flatten the curve and improve healthcare capacity.

Less is More: Modern Neonatology.

Iatrogenesis is more common in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) because the infants are vulnerable and exposed to prolonged intensive care. Sixty percent of extremely low-birth-weight infants are exposed to iatrogenesis. The risk factors for iatrogenesis in NICUs include prematurity, mechanical or non-invasive ventilation, central lines, and prolonged length of stay. This led to the notion that "less is more." In the delivery room delayed cord clamping is recommended for term and preterm infants, and suction for the airways in newborns with meconium-stained fluid is not performed anymore. As a symbol for a less aggressive attitude we use the term neonatal stabilization rather than resuscitation. Lower levels of oxygen saturations are accepted as normal during the first 10 minutes of life, and if respiratory assistance is needed, we no longer use 100% oxygen but 0.21-0.3 FiO2, depending on gestational age and the level of oxygen saturation. We try to avoid endotracheal ventilation by using non-invasive respiratory support and administering continuous positive airway pressure early on, starting in the delivery room. If surfactant is needed, non-invasive methods of surfactant administration are utilized. Use of central lines is shortened, and early feeding of human milk is the routine. Permissive hypercapnia is allowed, and continuous non-invasive monitoring not only of the O2 but also of CO2 is warranted. "Kangaroo care" and Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP) together with a calm atmosphere with parental involvement are encouraged. Whether "less is more," or not enough, is to be seen in future studies.

The possible of immunotherapy for COVID-19: A systematic review

The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging pathogen that was first described in late December 2019 and causes a severe respiratory infection in humans. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, international attention has raised to develop treatment and control options such as types of immunotherapies. The immunotherapy is an effective method for fighting against similar viral infections such as SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. These methods include several types of vaccines, monoclonal antibody candidates, and etc. This systematic review article was designed to evaluate the existing evidence and experience related to immunotherapy for 2019-nCoV. Web of Science (ISI), PubMed, and Scopus databases were used to search for suitable keywords such as 2019-nCoV, novel coronavirus, Immunotherapy, interleukin, vaccine and the related words for relevant publications up to 24.3.2020. The present systematic review was performed based on PRISMA protocol. Data extraction and quality valuation of articles were performed by two reviewers. 51 articles were the results of the search and based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 7 articles were included in the final review. As a conclusion of these studies demonstratedthat although no serious research has been done on this subject at the time of writing this article, similar studies on the related viruses showed notable results. So immunotherapy for this virus can also be a suitable option.

Indian resuscitation council (IRC) suggested guidelines for comprehensive cardiopulmonary life support (CCLS) for suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patient

Management of the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) remains challenging. The challenges are not only limited to its preventive strategies, but also extend to curative treatment, and are amplified during the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Older persons with comorbidities like diabetes mellitus, cardiac diseases, hepatic impairment, renal disorders and respiratory pathologies or immune impairing conditions are more vulnerable and have a higher mortality from COVID-19. Earlier, the Indian Resuscitation Council (IRC) had proposed the Comprehensive Cardiopulmonary Life Support (CCLS) for management of cardiac arrest victims in the hospital setting. However, in patients with COVID-19, the guidelines need to be modified,due to various concerns like differing etiology of cardiac arrest, virulence of the virus, risk of its transmission to rescuers, and the need to avoid or minimize aerosolization from the patient due to various interventions. There is limited evidence in these patients, as the SARS-CoV-2 is a novel infection and not much literature is available with high-level evidence related to CPR in patients of COVID-19. These suggested guidelines are a continuum of CCLS guidelines by IRC with an emphasis on the various challenges and concerns being faced during the resuscitative management of COVID-19 patients with cardiopulmonary arrest.

Right minithoracotomy versus conventional median sternotomy for patients undergoing mitral valve surgery and Cox-maze IV ablation with entirely bipolar radiofrequency clamp.

Cox-maze IV ablation by bipolar radiofrequency clamp was considered to be only performed through median sternotomy (MS), but impossible through right minithoracotomy (RM). Now, we developed a novel technique of performing Cox-maze IV ablation entirely by bipolar clamp through RM. To compare the outcomes of RM or MS for patients undergoing mitral valve surgery and concomitant Cox-maze IV ablation with entirely bipolar clamp. All 152 patients underwent mitral valve surgery and concomitant Cox-maze IV ablation with bipolar clamp through RM (n = 69) or MS (n = 83) were analyzed for outcome differences. The etiology of mitral valve disease was rheumatic (n = 97) and degenerative (n = 55). All patients had long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Diameter of left atrium ranged from 42 to 60 mm. All patients successfully underwent Cox-maze IV ablation by bipolar clamp. RM group had longer cardiopulmonary bypass time (130.3 ± 17.7 vs 115.3 ± 14.4 min; P < 0.001) and aortic cross-clamp time (91.8 ± 12.7 vs 74.6 ± 9.3 min; P < 0.001). But mechanical ventilation time (14.2 ± 6.6 vs 21.3 ± 9.0 h; P < 0.001) and hospital length of stay (9.3 ± 2.6 vs 11.7 ± 3.0 days; P < 0.001) were shorter in RM group. At discharge, the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm (NSR) was 94.2% in RM group and 95.1% in MS group (P = 1.000). Cumulative maintenance of NSR at 2 years postoperatively was 85.1 ± 5.8% in RM group and 88.6 ± 3.6% in MS group (P = 0.767). RM can achieve similar therapeutic effect to MS for patients undergoing mitral valve surgery and concomitant Cox-maze IV ablation with entirely bipolar clamp. In addition, patients through RM had faster recovery.

HER2-LAMP vaccines effectively traffic to endolysosomal compartments and generate enhanced polyfunctional T cell responses that induce complete tumor regression

BACKGROUND: The advent of immune checkpoint blockade antibodies has demonstrated that effective mobilization of T cell responses can cause tumor regression of metastatic cancers, although these responses are heterogeneous and restricted to certain histologic types of cancer. To enhance these responses, there has been renewed emphasis in developing effective cancer-specific vaccines to stimulate and direct T cell immunity to important oncologic targets, such as the oncogene human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), expressed in ~20% of breast cancers (BCs). METHODS: In our study, we explored the use of alternative antigen trafficking through use of a lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP) domain to enhance vaccine efficacy against HER2 and other model antigens in both in vitro and in vivo studies. RESULTS: We found that inclusion of this domain in plasmid vaccines effectively trafficked antigens to endolysosomal compartments, resulting in enhanced major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II presentation. Additionally, this augmented the expansion/activation of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and also led to elevated levels of antigen-specific polyfunctional CD8+ T cells. Significantly, vaccination with HER2-LAMP produced tumor regression in ~30% of vaccinated mice with established tumors in an endogenous model of metastatic HER2+ BC, compared with 0% of HER2-WT vaccinated mice. This therapeutic benefit is associated with enhanced tumor infiltration of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the potential of using LAMP-based endolysosomal trafficking as a means to augment the generation of polyfunctional, antigen-specific T cells in order to improve antitumor therapeutic responses using cancer antigen vaccines.

Cytomegalovirus Pneumonia: Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Immunocompetent Hosts

Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) are DNA viruses and are members of the Herpesviridae family. Morphologically, CMV resembles other herpes viruses, particularly herpes simplex viruses, with important cytopathic differences. CMVs are recognized pathogens that cause community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in compromised hosts, such as, those who undergo transplants and those on immunosuppressive drugs or steroids. This article discusses the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and therapy for this viral CAP.

Unknown SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia detected by PET/CT in patients with cancer

INTRODUCTION: In January 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Italy necessitated rigorous application of more restrictive safety procedures in the management and treatment of patients with cancer to ensure patient and staff protection. Identification of respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was a challenge during the pandemic owing to a large number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients. METHODS: We report 5 patients with unknown SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) with radiopharmaceuticals targeting different tumor processes: 18F-FDG, 18F-choline (FCH), and 68Ga-PSMA. RESULTS: In all patients, PET/CT showed increased tracer uptake in the lungs corresponding to CT findings of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Quantitative assessment of tracer uptake showed more elevated values for the glucose analogue 18F-FDG (mean SUVmax 5.4) than for the other tracers (mean SUVmax 3.5). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that PET/CT is a sensitive modality to hypothesize SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in patients with cancer, even when asymptomatic. More data are needed to verify the correlation among immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical evolution, and PET results. Under the strict safety measures implemented at the PET center, the number of potentially SARS-CoV-2-positive patients undergoing PET/CT was very low (1.6%), and no staff member has been diagnosed with infection as of April 30, 2020.

The GAIT Translational Control System

The interferon (IFN)-γ-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) system directs transcript-selective translational control of functionally-related genes. In myeloid cells, IFN-γ induces formation of a multiprotein GAIT complex that binds structural GAIT elements in the 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of multiple inflammation-related mRNAs, including ceruloplasmin and VEGF-A, and represses their translation. The human GAIT complex is a heterotetramer containing glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS), NS1-associated protein 1 (NSAP1), ribosomal protein L13a (L13a), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). A network of IFN-γ-stimulated kinases regulates recruitment and assembly of GAIT complex constituents. Activation of Cdk5, mTORC1, and S6K1 kinases induces EPRS release from its parental multi-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex to join NSAP1 in a “pre-GAIT” complex. Subsequently, the DAPK-ZIPK kinase axis phosphorylates L13a, inducing release from the 60S ribosomal subunit and binding to GAPDH. The subcomplexes join to form the functional GAIT complex. Each constituent has a distinct role in the GAIT system. EPRS binds the GAIT element in target mRNAs, NSAP1 negatively regulates mRNA binding, L13a binds eIF4G to block ribosome recruitment, and GAPDH shields L13a from proteasomal degradation. The GAIT system is susceptible to genetic and condition-specific regulation. An N-terminus EPRS truncate is a dominant-negative inhibitor ensuring a “translational trickle” of target transcripts. Also, hypoxia and oxidatively-modified lipoproteins regulate GAIT activity. Mouse models exhibiting absent or genetically-modified GAIT complex constituents are beginning to elucidate the physiological role of the GAIT system, particularly in the resolution of chronic inflammation. Finally, GAIT-like systems in proto-chordates suggests an evolutionarily conserved role of the pathway in innate immunity.

Social isolation and the mitigation of coronavirus anxiety: The mediating role of meaning

This study examined core belief violation and meaning making as mechanisms mediating the relationship between adherence to social isolation policies for mitigating coronavirus transmission and reduced coronavirus anxiety (CA). Adherence to social isolation policies (social distancing, sheltering in place, and cessation of long-distance travel), use of nonsocial precautionary measures (handwashing, wearing a mask), core belief violation, meaning made of the COVID pandemic, and CA were assessed in a sample of 408 North Americans. Process analysis revealed that adhering to social isolation policies predicted lower levels of CA and that this effect was largely mediated by conservation of core beliefs (e.g., in predictability, control, and self-agency) and ability to make meaning of the pandemic. In contrast, exclusive reliance on nonsocial protections such as handwashing and mask wearing was associated with high levels of CA. These results suggest that social isolation policies support the integrity of adherents' meaning systems, thereby mitigating distress, which carries useful implications for both policy and psychological intervention.

State-of-the-art diagnosis and surgical treatment of acute peri-prosthetic joint infection following primary total hip arthroplasty.

Acute peri-prosthetic joint infection (PJI) following total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a potentially devastating and undesired complication, with a prevalence of 0.3% to 2.9%. Its suspicion begins with a meticulous physical examination and anamnesis. Diagnosis should be made on the basis of the Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria. Serum and synovial biomarkers are very useful tools when major criteria are absent.Although sometimes not possible due to medical conditions, surgery is usually the first line of treatment. Although its outcome is highly correlated with the isolated microorganism, irrigation and debridement with implant retention (DAIR) is the gold standard for treatment. Ideally, the prior approach should be proximally and distally extended to augment the field of view and remove all of the prosthetic modular components, that is, femoral head and acetabular insert.Given DAIR's unclear control of infection, with successful outcomes in the range of 30% to 95%, one- or two-stage revision protocols may play a role in certain cases of acute infections; nonetheless, further prospective, randomized studies are necessary to compare long-term outcomes between DAIR and revision surgeries.Following surgical treatment, length of antibiotherapy is in the range of six weeks to six months, without any difference in outcomes between short and long protocols. Treatment should be adjusted to the isolated bacteria and controlled further with post-operative serum biomarker levels. Cite this article: EFORT Open Rev 2018;3:434-441.

Effect of gelatin-polysuccinat on cerebral oxygenation and microcirculation in a porcine haemorrhagic shock model.

BACKGROUND During early treatment of haemorrhagic shock maintenance of cerebral and end-organ oxygen supply by fluid resuscitation is mandatory. Gelatin-polysuccinat (GP) recently regained attention despite a still unclear risk profile and widely unknown effects on cerebral and peripheral microcirculation. This study investigates the effects of GP versus balanced electrolyte solution (BEL) with focus on cerebral regional oxygen saturation and peripheral microcirculation in a porcine haemorrhagic shock model. METHODS After Animal Care Committee approval haemorrhagic shock was induced by arterial blood withdrawal in 27 anaesthetized pigs. Consequently, the animals received rapid fluid resuscitation by either GP or BEL to replace the removed amount of blood, or remained untreated (n = 3 × 9). Over two hours cerebral regional oxygen saturation by near-infrared spectroscopy and peripheral buccal microcirculation by combined white-light spectrometry and laser-Doppler flowmetry were recorded. Secondary parameters included extended haemodynamics, spirometry, haematological and blood gas parameters. RESULTS Both fluid resuscitation regimes sufficiently stabilized the macro- and microcirculation in haemorrhagic shock with a more pronounced effect following GP infusion. GP administration led to a persisting, critical impairment of cerebral regional oxygen saturation through considerable haemodilution. Survival rates were 100% in both fluid resuscitation groups, but only 33% in the untreated control. CONCLUSION Equal amounts of GP and BEL sufficiently stabilize systemic circulation and microcirculatory perfusion. Forced fluid resuscitation by GP should be applied with caution to prevent haemodilution-induced impairment of cerebral oxygen delivery.

Molecular Diagnostics in Sepsis: From Bedside to Bench

Background Based on recent in vitro data, we tested the hypothesis that microarray expression profiles can be used to diagnose sepsis, distinguishing in vivo between sterile and infectious causes of systemic inflammation. Study design Exploratory studies were conducted using spleens from septic patients and from mice with abdominal sepsis. Seven patients with sepsis after injury were identified retrospectively and compared with six injured patients. C57BL/6 male mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture, or to IP lipopolysaccharide. Control mice had sham laparotomy or injection of IP saline, respectively. A sepsis classification model was created and tested on blood samples from septic mice. Results Accuracy of sepsis prediction was obtained using cross-validation of gene expression data from 12 human spleen samples and from 16 mouse spleen samples. For blood studies, classifiers were constructed using data from a training data set of 26 microarrays. The error rate of the classifiers was estimated on seven de-identified microarrays, and then on a subsequent cross-validation for all 33 blood microarrays. Estimates of classification accuracy of sepsis in human spleen were 67.1%; in mouse spleen, 96%; and in mouse blood, 94.4% (all estimates were based on nested cross-validation). Lists of genes with substantial changes in expression between study and control groups were used to identify nine mouse common inflammatory response genes, six of which were mapped into a single pathway using contemporary pathway analysis tools. Conclusions Sepsis induces changes in mouse leukocyte gene expression that can be used to diagnose sepsis apart from systemic inflammation.

Frequency of shedding of respiratory pathogens in horses recently imported to the United States

BACKGROUND: Imported horses that have undergone recent long distance transport might represent a serious risk for spreading infectious respiratory pathogens into populations of horses. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of shedding of respiratory pathogens in recently imported horses. ANIMALS: All imported horses with signed owner consent (n = 167) entering a USDA quarantine for contagious equine metritis from October 2014 to June 2016 were enrolled in the study. METHODS: Prospective observational study. Enrolled horses had a physical examination performed and nasal secretions collected at the time of entry and subsequently if any horse developed signs of respiratory disease during quarantine. Samples were assayed for equine influenza virus (EIV), equine herpesvirus type‐1, −2, −4, and −5 (EHV‐1, −2, −4, −5), equine rhinitis virus A (ERAV), and B (ERBV) and Streptococcus equi subspecies equi (S. equi) using quantitative PCR (qPCR). RESULTS: Equine herpesviruses were detected by qPCR in 52% of the study horses including EHV‐2 (28.7%), EHV‐5 (40.7%), EHV‐1 (1.2%), and EHV‐4 (3.0%). Clinical signs were not correlated with being qPCR‐positive for EHV‐4, EHV‐2, or EHV‐5. None of the samples were qPCR‐positive for EIV, ERAV, ERBV, and S. equi. The qPCR assay failed quality control for RNA viruses in 25% (46/167) of samples. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Clinical signs of respiratory disease were poorly correlated with qPCR positive status for EHV‐2, −4, and −5. The importance of γ‐herpesviruses (EHV‐2 and 5) in respiratory disease is poorly understood. Equine herpesvirus type‐1 or 4 (EHV‐1 or EHV‐4) were detected in 4.2% of horses, which could have serious consequences if shedding animals entered a population of susceptible horses. Biosecurity measures are important when introducing recently imported horses into resident US populations of horses.

Descriptive study of severe hospitalized cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza during five epidemic seasons (2010–2015)

OBJECTIVE: The Plan of Information on Acute Respiratory Infections in Catalonia (PIDIRAC) included the surveillance of severe hospitalized cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza (SHCLCI) in 2009. The objective of this study was to determine the clinical, epidemiological and virological features of SHCLCI recorded in 12 sentinel hospitals during five influenza seasons. RESULTS: From a sample of SHCLCI recorded during the 5 influenza epidemics seasons from 2010–2011 to 2014–2015, Cases were confirmed by PCR and/or viral isolation in cell cultures from respiratory samples. A total of 1400 SHCLCI were recorded, 33% required ICU admission and 12% died. The median age of cases was 61 years (range 0–101 years); 70.5% were unvaccinated; 80.4% received antiviral treatment (in 79.6 and 24% of cases within 48 h after hospital admission and the onset of symptoms, respectively); influenza virus A [37.9% A (H1N1)pdm09, 29.3% A (H3N2)] was identified in 87.7% of cases. Surveillance of SHCLCI provides an estimate of the severity of seasonal influenza epidemics and the identification and characterization of at-risk groups in order to facilitate preventive measures such as vaccination and early antiviral treatment. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (10.1186/s13104-018-3349-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Breathing Is Enough: For the Spread of Influenza Virus and SARS-CoV-2 by Breathing Only

Background: The transmission of respiratory viruses such as influenza and corona viruses from one person to another is still not fully understood. Methods: A literature search showed that there is a strong scientific rationale and evidence that viruses are very efficiently spread through aerosols by the patient's breathing only. It is not necessary for the patient to cough or sneeze. Results: The exhaled aerosol particles are generated by normal breathing in the deep lung through reopening of collapsed small airways during inspiration. These mucus/surfactant aerosols (size range between 0.2 and 0.6 µm) can transport viruses out of the lungs of patients and be present in the room air for hours. Conclusion: These aerosol particles are difficult to filter out of the air; because of their physical properties, new strategies must be developed to protect people from these virus aerosols.

Design of Wide-Spectrum Inhibitors Targeting Coronavirus Main Proteases

The genus Coronavirus contains about 25 species of coronaviruses (CoVs), which are important pathogens causing highly prevalent diseases and often severe or fatal in humans and animals. No licensed specific drugs are available to prevent their infection. Different host receptors for cellular entry, poorly conserved structural proteins (antigens), and the high mutation and recombination rates of CoVs pose a significant problem in the development of wide-spectrum anti-CoV drugs and vaccines. CoV main proteases (M(pro)s), which are key enzymes in viral gene expression and replication, were revealed to share a highly conservative substrate-recognition pocket by comparison of four crystal structures and a homology model representing all three genetic clusters of the genus Coronavirus. This conclusion was further supported by enzyme activity assays. Mechanism-based irreversible inhibitors were designed, based on this conserved structural region, and a uniform inhibition mechanism was elucidated from the structures of M(pro)-inhibitor complexes from severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. A structure-assisted optimization program has yielded compounds with fast in vitro inactivation of multiple CoV M(pro)s, potent antiviral activity, and extremely low cellular toxicity in cell-based assays. Further modification could rapidly lead to the discovery of a single agent with clinical potential against existing and possible future emerging CoV-related diseases.

Geschichtlicher Überblick

Für die Krankheiten, die wir heute als Viruserkrankungen kennen, sah man ursprünglich „Gifte“ als Ursache an. Mit den damals üblichen Methoden ließen sich keine (krankheitserzeugenden) pathogenen Organismen wie Bakterien oder Protozoen in den „giftigen Materialien“ nachweisen. Erst gegen Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts legten Tierversuche, die von Louis Pasteur durchgeführt wurden und bei denen sich auch nach mehreren Passagen keine Ausverdünnung der giftigen Eigenschaften einstellte, nahe, dass das krankheitsauslösende Agens in der Lage war, sich im Organismus zu vermehren. Man sprach deshalb von einem in lebenden Organismen, später auch von einem in Zellen vermehrungsfähigen „Virus“ (lateinisch für „Gift“ oder „Schleim“). Im Jahre 1892 konnte Dimitri I. Iwanowski in St. Petersburg zeigen, dass die Mosaikkrankheit der Tabakpflanzen durch ein „ultrafiltrierbares“ und damit deutlich unter Bakteriengröße liegendes Agens verursacht wird: das Tabakmosaikvirus.

CT-based COVID-19 Triage: Deep Multitask Learning Improves Joint Identification and Severity Quantification

The current COVID-19 pandemic overloads healthcare systems, including radiology departments. Though several deep learning approaches were developed to assist in CT analysis, nobody considered study triage directly as a computer science problem. We describe two basic setups: Identification of COVID-19 to prioritize studies of potentially infected patients to isolate them as early as possible; Severity quantification to highlight studies of severe patients and direct them to a hospital or provide emergency medical care. We formalize these tasks as binary classification and estimation of affected lung percentage. Though similar problems were well-studied separately, we show that existing methods provide reasonable quality only for one of these setups. To consolidate both triage approaches, we employ a multitask learning and propose a convolutional neural network to combine all available labels within a single model. We train our model on approximately 2000 publicly available CT studies and test it with a carefully designed set consisting of 33 COVID patients, 32 healthy patients, and 36 patients with other lung pathologies to emulate a typical patient flow in an out-patient hospital. The developed model achieved 0.951 ROC AUC for Identification of COVID-19 and 0.98 Spearman Correlation for Severity quantification. We release all the code and create a public leaderboard, where other community members can test their models on our dataset.

Viruses associated with acute respiratory infection in a community‐based cohort of healthy New Zealand children

Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a major cause of morbidity among children. Respiratory viruses are commonly detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic periods. The rates of infection and community epidemiology of respiratory viruses in healthy children needs further definition to assist interpretation of molecular diagnostic assays in this population. Children otherwise healthy aged 1 to 8 years were prospectively enrolled in the study during two consecutive winters, when ARIs peak in New Zealand. Parents completed a daily symptom diary for 8 weeks, during which time they collected a nasal swab from the child for each clinical ARI episode. A further nasal swab was collected by research staff during a clinic visit at the conclusion of the study. All samples were tested for 15 respiratory viruses commonly causing ARI using molecular multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays. There were 575 ARIs identified from 301 children completing the study, at a rate of 1.04 per child‐month. Swabs collected during an ARI were positive for a respiratory virus in 76.8% (307 of 400), compared with 37.3% (79 of 212) of swabs collected during asymptomatic periods. The most common viruses detected were human rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza viruses, influenzavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus. All of these were significantly more likely to be detected during ARIs than asymptomatic periods. Parent‐administered surveillance is a useful mechanism for understanding infectious disease in healthy children in the community. Interpretation of molecular diagnostic assays for viruses must be informed by understanding of local rates of asymptomatic infection by such viruses.

Proteome-wide analysis of differentially-expressed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in early COVID-19 infection

Rapid and accurate tests that detect IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 proteins are essential in slowing the spread of COVID-19 by identifying patients who are infected with COVID-19. Using a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray developed in our lab, we comprehensively profiled both IgM and IgG antibodies in forty patients with early-stage COVID-19, influenza, or non-influenza who had similar symptoms. The results revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is not an ideal biomarker for COVID-19 diagnosis because of its low immunogenicity, thus tests that rely on this marker alone will have a high false negative rate. Our data further suggest that the S protein subunit 1 receptor binding domain (S1-RBD) might be the optimal antigen for IgM antibody detection, while the S protein extracellular domain (S1+S2ECD) would be the optimal antigen for both IgM and IgG antibody detection. Notably, the combination of all IgM and IgG biomarkers can identify 87% and 73.3% COVID-19 patients, respectively. Finally, the COVID-19-specific antibodies are significantly correlated with the clinical indices of viral infection and acute myocardial injury (p≤0.05).

Single intranasal immunization with chimpanzee adenovirus-based vaccine induces sustained and protective immunity against MERS-CoV infection

The recently identified Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe and fatal acute respiratory illness in humans. However, no approved prophylactic and therapeutic interventions are currently available. The MERS-CoV envelope spike protein serves as a crucial target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccine development, as it plays a critical role in mediating viral entry through interactions with the cellular receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). Here, we constructed a recombinant rare serotype of the chimpanzee adenovirus 68 (AdC68) that expresses full-length MERS-CoV S protein (AdC68-S). Single intranasal immunization with AdC68-S induced robust and sustained neutralizing antibody and T cell responses in BALB/c mice. In a human DPP4 knock-in (hDPP4-KI) mouse model, it completely protected against lethal challenge with a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERS-CoV-MA). Passive transfer of immune sera to naïve hDPP4-KI mice also provided survival advantages from lethal MERS-CoV-MA challenge. Analysis of sera absorption and isolated monoclonal antibodies from immunized mice demonstrated that the potent and broad neutralizing activity was largely attributed to antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. These results show that AdC68-S can induce protective immune responses in mice and represent a promising candidate for further development against MERS-CoV infection in both dromedaries and humans.

Knowledge Transfer in Science Education: The Case for Usability-Based Knowledge Visualization Guidelines

There is growing evidence that visualization aids knowledge transfer. However, the cases where learners have been actively involved as co-creators of knowledge visualization aids are limited. Furthermore, employing knowledge visualization for teaching and learning in high-school science have been proposed but empirical evidence of the effect on knowledge transfer is limited. The purpose of this study is to report on the knowledge transfer effect of applying usability-based knowledge visualization guidelines. A design-based research methodology guided by pragmatism was applied. The data capturing methods include a questionnaire-based survey, interviews and observations. The results suggest that the use of knowledge visualization can support knowledge transfer and the students’ learning experience in secondary school education, but more research is required to confirm this. The contribution of this paper is to add to the emerging discourse on the use of knowledge visualization for teaching and learning, and to report on how knowledge visualization guidelines can be used in practice.

Multiple testing, cumulative radiation dose, and clinical indications in patients undergoing myocardial perfusion imaging.

CONTEXT Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is the single medical test with the highest radiation burden to the US population. Although many patients undergoing MPI receive repeat MPI testing, or additional procedures involving ionizing radiation, no data are available characterizing their total longitudinal radiation burden and relating radiation burden with reasons for testing. OBJECTIVES To characterize procedure counts, cumulative estimated effective doses of radiation, and clinical indications for patients undergoing MPI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS A retrospective cohort study of 1097 consecutive patients undergoing index MPI during the first 100 days of 2006 (January 1-April 10) at Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, that evaluated all preceding medical imaging procedures involving ionizing radiation undergone beginning October 1988, and all subsequent procedures through June 2008, at the center. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Cumulative estimated effective dose of radiation, number of procedures involving radiation, and indications for testing. RESULTS Patients underwent a median of 15 (interquartile range [IQR], 6-32; mean, 23.9) procedures involving radiation exposure; of which 4 (IQR, 2-8; mean, 6.5) were high-dose procedures (≥3 mSv; ie, 1 year's background radiation), including 1 (IQR, 1-2; mean, 1.8) MPI study per patient. A total of 344 patients (31.4%) received cumulative estimated effective dose from all medical sources of more than 100 mSv. Multiple MPIs were performed in 424 patients (38.6%), for whom cumulative estimated effective dose was 121 mSv (IQR, 81-189; mean, 149 mSv). Men and white patients had higher cumulative estimated effective doses. More than 80% of initial and 90% of repeat MPI examinations were performed in patients with known cardiac disease or symptoms consistent with it. CONCLUSION In this institution, multiple testing with MPI was common and in many patients associated with high cumulative estimated doses of radiation.

Gene therapy for cystic fibrosis: an example for lung gene therapy

Gene therapy is currently being evaluated for a wide range of acute and chronic lung diseases. The requirement of gene transfer into the individual cell types of the complex lung structure will very much depend on the target disease. Over the last decade, the gene therapy community has recognized that there is not even one vector that is good for all applications, but that the gene transfer agent has to be carefully chosen. Gene therapy is particularly attractive for diseases that currently do not have satisfactory treatment options and probably easier for monogenic disorders than for complex diseases. Cystic fibrosis (CF) fulfills these criteria and is therefore a good candidate for gene therapy-based treatment. This review will focus on CF as an example for lung gene therapy and discuss the progress made in this field over the last couple of years.

Human coronavirus 229E nonstructural protein 13: characterization of duplex-unwinding, nucleoside triphosphatase, and RNA 5'-triphosphatase activities.

The human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) replicase gene-encoded nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13) contains an N-terminal zinc-binding domain and a C-terminal superfamily 1 helicase domain. A histidine-tagged form of nsp13, which was expressed in insect cells and purified, is reported to unwind efficiently both partial-duplex RNA and DNA of up to several hundred base pairs. Characterization of the nsp13-associated nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) activities revealed that all natural ribonucleotides and nucleotides are substrates of nsp13, with ATP, dATP, and GTP being hydrolyzed most efficiently. Using the NTPase active site, HCoV-229E nsp13 also mediates RNA 5'-triphosphatase activity, which may be involved in the capping of viral RNAs.

Coronavirus replicase-reporter fusions provide quantitative analysis of replication and replication complex formation.

UNLABELLED The replication of coronaviruses occurs in association with multiple virus-induced membrane structures that evolve during the course of infection; however, the dynamics of this process remain poorly understood. Previous studies of coronavirus replication complex organization and protein interactions have utilized protein overexpression studies and immunofluorescence of fixed cells. Additionally, live-imaging studies of coronavirus replicase proteins have used fluorescent reporter molecules fused to replicase proteins, but expressed from nonnative locations, mostly late-transcribed subgenomic mRNAs, in the presence or absence of the native protein. Thus, the timing and targeting of native replicase proteins expressed in real time from native locations in the genome remain unknown. In this study, we tested whether reporter molecules could be expressed from the replicase polyprotein of murine hepatitis virus as fusions with nonstructural protein 2 or 3 and whether such reporters could define the targeting and activity of replicase proteins during infection. We demonstrate that the fusion of green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase with either nonstructural protein 2 or 3 is tolerated and that these reporter-replicase fusions can be used to quantitate replication complex formation and virus replication. The results show that the replicase gene has flexibility to accommodate a foreign gene addition and can be used directly to study replicase complex formation and evolution during infection as well as to provide highly sensitive and specific markers for protein translation and genome replication. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses that are important agents of disease, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Replication is associated with multiple virus-induced membrane structures that evolve during infection; however, the dynamics of this process remain poorly understood. In this study, we tested whether reporter molecules expressed from native locations within the replicase polyprotein of murine hepatitis virus as fusions with nonstructural proteins could define the expression and targeting of replicase proteins during infection in live cells. We demonstrate that the replicase gene tolerates the introduction of green fluorescent protein or firefly luciferase as fusions with replicase proteins. These viruses allow early quantitation of virus replication as well as real-time measurement of replication complexes.

IgM, IgA, IgG1 and IgG2 specific responses in blood and gut secretion of calves fed soyabean products

Calves fed soya proteins may develop severe gastrointestinal disorders. Whether these are predominantly associated with particular Ig subclasses and (or) dietary proteins remains unclear. Therefore, antibody responses to soyabean protein were analysed by dot- and blot-immunobinding in plasma and intestinal mucous secretions. One-month-old calves were fed for 2.5 months liquid diets based on skim milk powder (SMP) or a mixture (2:3, protein basis) of whey and soyabean products including a low antigenic hydrolysed soya protein isolate (HSPI) and a highly antigenic heated soya flour (HSF). Specific antibodies (Abs) of the main isotypes (IgM, IgA, IgG1, IgG2) were characterised by immunostaining of samples which had been previously incubated with nitrocellulose sheets coated with SMP, HSPI or HSF extracts. Plasma collected before feeding experimental diets showed very little specific Abs. By contrast, 2.5 month later, a three-fold increase (P < 0.05) in IgG1 and IgA titres against HSF antigens was observed in calves fed HSF compared with those fed the control or HSPI diet. IgG1 immunoblotting revealed many protein bands from soya in the molecular range of 22–32 and 38–42 kDa. Immunorecognition of specific proteins from SMP and HSPI remained low and similar among animal groups. Specific IgM, IgA and IgG1 titres against HSF, and to a lesser extent HSPI, were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in jejunal mucous secretion of calves fed HSF compared with other groups. Secretions from calves fed HSF bound to many soyabean proteins in the range of 17–23 and 26–38 kDa, with similar patterns for IgA and IgG1. By contrast, only weak bands were found for IgM and IgG2 in all groups of calves. Thus, calves fed antigenic HSF do present specific Abs including IgG1 and IgA isotypes, both systemically and locally. Therefore, IgG1 and (or) IgA rather than IgM and IgG2 Abs may be preferred for assessing the immunogenicity of soyabean products in calves. Interestingly, soyabean immunogenicity was drastically reduced by adequate proteolysis.

Endothelial Cells Support Persistent Gammaherpesvirus 68 Infection

A variety of human diseases are associated with gammaherpesviruses, including neoplasms of lymphocytes (e.g. Burkitt's lymphoma) and endothelial cells (e.g. Kaposi's sarcoma). Gammaherpesvirus infections usually result in either a productive lytic infection, characterized by expression of all viral genes and rapid cell lysis, or latent infection, characterized by limited viral gene expression and no cell lysis. Here, we report characterization of endothelial cell infection with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (γHV68), a virus phylogenetically related and biologically similar to the human gammaherpesviruses. Endothelial cells supported γHV68 replication in vitro, but were unique in that a significant proportion of the cells escaped lysis, proliferated, and remained viable in culture for an extended time. Upon infection, endothelial cells became non-adherent and altered in size, complexity, and cell-surface protein expression. These cells were uniformly infected and expressed the lytic transcription program based on detection of abundant viral gene transcripts, GFP fluorescence from the viral genome, and viral surface protein expression. Additionally, endothelial cells continued to produce new infectious virions as late as 30 days post-infection. The outcome of this long-term infection was promoted by the γHV68 v-cyclin, because in the absence of the v-cyclin, viability was significantly reduced following infection. Importantly, infected primary endothelial cells also demonstrated increased viability relative to infected primary fibroblasts, and this increased viability was dependent on the v-cyclin. Finally, we provide evidence for infection of endothelial cells in vivo in immune-deficient mice. The extended viability and virus production of infected endothelial cells indicated that endothelial cells provided a source of prolonged virus production and identify a cell-type specific adaptation of gammaherpesvirus replication. While infected endothelial cells would likely be cleared in a healthy individual, persistently infected endothelial cells could provide a source of continued virus replication in immune-compromised individuals, a context in which gammaherpesvirus-associated pathology frequently occurs.

Immunological responses against SARS-coronavirus infection in humans.

Since the outbreak of a SARS epidemic last year, significant advances have been made on our understanding of the mechanisms of interaction between the SARS coronavirus (CoV) and the immune system. Strong humoral responses have been found in most patients following SARS-CoV infection, with high titers of neutralizing Abs present in their convalescent sera. The nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV appear to be the dominant antigens recognized by serum Abs. CD4+ T cell responses against the N protein have been observed in SARS patients and an HLA-A2-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope in the S protein has been identified. It is likely that the immune responses induced by SARS-CoV infection could also cause pathological damage to the host, especially in the case of proinflammatory cytokines. There is also evidence suggesting that SARS-CoV might be able to directly invade cells of the immune system. Our understanding on the interaction between SARS-CoV, the immune system and local tissues is essential to future diagnosis, control and treatment of this very contagious disease.

Macrophage Activation Syndrome

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), or termed macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) when associated with rheumatic disorders, is a frequently fatal complication of infections, rheumatic disorders, and hematopoietic malignancies. Clinically, HLH/MAS is a life-threatening condition that is usually diagnosed among febrile hospitalized patients (children and adults) who commonly present with unremitting fever and a shock-like multiorgan dysfunction scenario. Laboratory studies reveal pancytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, elevated markers of inflammation (ESR, CRP), hyperferritinemia, and features of coagulopathy. In about 60% of cases, excess hemophagocytosis (macrophages/histiocytes engulfing other hematopoietic cell types) is noted on biopsy specimens from the bone marrow, liver, lymph nodes, and other organs. HLH/MAS has been hypothesized to occur when a threshold level of inflammation has been achieved, and genetic and environmental risk factors are believed to contribute to the hyperinflammatory state. A broad variety of infections, from viruses to fungi to bacteria, have been identified as triggers of HLH/MAS, either in isolation or in addition to an underlying inflammatory disease state. Certain infections, particularly by members of the herpesvirus family, are the most notorious triggers of HLH/MAS. Treatment for infection-triggered MAS requires therapy for both the underlying infection and dampening of the hyperactive immune response.

Some remarks on protein attribute prediction and pseudo amino acid composition

Abstract With the accomplishment of human genome sequencing, the number of sequence-known proteins has increased explosively. In contrast, the pace is much slower in determining their biological attributes. As a consequence, the gap between sequence-known proteins and attribute-known proteins has become increasingly large. The unbalanced situation, which has critically limited our ability to timely utilize the newly discovered proteins for basic research and drug development, has called for developing computational methods or high-throughput automated tools for fast and reliably identifying various attributes of uncharacterized proteins based on their sequence information alone. Actually, during the last two decades or so, many methods in this regard have been established in hope to bridge such a gap. In the course of developing these methods, the following things were often needed to consider: (1) benchmark dataset construction, (2) protein sample formulation, (3) operating algorithm (or engine), (4) anticipated accuracy, and (5) web-server establishment. In this review, we are to discuss each of the five procedures, with a special focus on the introduction of pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), its different modes and applications as well as its recent development, particularly in how to use the general formulation of PseAAC to reflect the core and essential features that are deeply hidden in complicated protein sequences.

COVID-19 Interconnectedness: Health Inequity, the Climate Crisis, and Collective Trauma

The COVID-19 pandemic brings to the forefront the complex interconnected dilemmas of globalization, health equity, economic security, environmental justice, and collective trauma, severely impacting the marginalized and people of color in the United States. This lack of access to and the quality of healthcare, affordable housing, and lack of financial resources also continue to have a more significant impact on documented and undocumented immigrants. This paper aims at examining these critical issues and developing a framework for family therapists to address these challenges by focusing on four interrelated dimensions: cultural values, social determinants of health, collective trauma, and the ethical and moral responsibility of family therapists. Given the fact that family therapists may unwittingly function as the best ally of an economic and political system that perpetuates institutionalized racism and class discrimination, we need to utilize a set of principles, values, and practices that are not just palliative or after the fact but bring forth into the psychotherapeutic and policy work a politics of care. Therefore, a strong call to promote and advocate for the broader continuum of health and critical thinking preparing professionals to meet the challenges of health equity, as well as economic and environmental justice, are needed. The issues discussed in this paper are specific to the United States despite their relevance to family therapy as a field. We are mindful not to generalize the United States' reality to the rest of the world, recognizing that issues discussed in this paper could potentially contribute to international discourse.

Delayed Radical Prostatectomy is Not Associated with Adverse Oncological Outcomes: Implications for Men Experiencing Surgical Delay Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

PURPOSE The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has forced many healthcare organizations to divert efforts and resources to emergent patient care, delaying many elective oncological surgeries. We investigated an association between delay in radical prostatectomy (RP) and oncological outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a retrospective review of men with intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer (PC) in the National Cancer Database (NCDB) underdoing radical prostatectomy from 2010-2016. Immediate RP was defined as RP within 3-months of diagnosis, while delayed RP was analyzed in 3-month intervals up to 12-months. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to test for associations between levels of delayed RP and outcomes of interest (adverse pathology, upgrading on RP, node positive disease, and post-RP secondary treatments) compared with men undergoing immediate RP. RESULTS We identified 128,062 men with intermediate- and high-risk PC treated with RP. After adjustment, we did not appreciate a significant difference in odds of adverse pathology, upgrading, node positive disease, or post-RP secondary treatments between men treated with immediate RP and any level of delay up to 12 months. Subgroup analysis of men with Grade group 4 and 5 PC did not demonstrate an association between delayed RP and worse oncological outcomes. CONCLUSIONS In the NCDB, delayed RP was not associated with early adverse oncological outcomes at RP. These results may provide reassurance to patients and urologists balancing care in the current pandemic.

Pre-hospital trauma care in Switzerland and Germany: do they speak the same language?

PURPOSE: Swiss and German (pre-)hospital systems, distribution and organization of trauma centres differ from each other. It is unclear if outcome in trauma patients differs as well. Therefore, this study aims to determine differences in characteristics, therapy and outcome of trauma patients between both German-speaking countries. METHODS: The TraumaRegister DGU(®) (TR-DGU) was used. Patients with Injury Severity Score ≥ 9 admitted to a level 1 trauma centre between 01/2009 and 12/2017 were included if they required ICU care or died. Trauma pattern, pre-hospital procedures and outcome were compared between Swiss (CH, n = 4768) and German (DE, n = 66,908) groups. RESULTS: Swiss patients were older than German patients (53 vs. 50 years). ISS did not differ between groups (CH 23.8 vs. DE 23.0 points). There were more low falls < 3 m (34% vs. 21%) at the expense of less traffic accidents (37% vs. 52%) in the Swiss population. In Switzerland 30% of allocations were done without physician involvement, whereas this occurred in 4% of German cases. Despite a comparable number of patients with a GCS ≤ 8 (CH 29.6%; DE 26.4%), differences in pre-hospital intubation rates occurred (CH 31% vs. DE 40%). Severe traumatic brain injuries were diagnosed most frequently in Switzerland (CH 62% vs. DE 49%). Admission vital signs were similar, and standardized mortality ratios were close to one in both countries. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that patients’ age, trauma patterns and pre-hospital care differ between Germany and Switzerland. However, adjusted mortality was almost similar. Further benchmarking studies are indicated to optimize trauma care in both German-speaking countries.

Bronchial blocker versus double-lumen endobronchial tube in minimally invasive cardiac surgery.

BACKGROUND To compare the therapeutic value of a bronchial blocker (BB) with a double-lumen tube (DLT) in minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS). METHODS Sixty patients who underwent MICS were randomized to use either a DLT (Group D, n = 30) or a BB (Group B, n = 29; one failed was omitted). The following data were collected: time of intubation and tube localization; incidence of tube displacement; postoperative sore throat and hoarseness; time of cardiopulmonary bypass; maintenance time for SpO2 < 90% (PaCO2 < 60 mmHg); mean arterial pressure and heart rate; SpO2, PaO2, PaCO2, EtCO2, mean airway pressure, and airway peak pressure; surgeons' satisfaction with anesthesia; and short-term complications. RESULTS The times of intubation and tube localization were significantly longer in Group B than in Group D (P < 0.05). Patients in Group B exhibited significantly lower incidence of tube displacement, postoperative sore throat, and hoarseness when compared with patients in Group D (P < 0.05). Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were significantly lower in Group B than in Group D after tracheal intubation (P < 0.05). The mean airway pressure and airway peak pressure were significantly lower in Group B than in Group D after one-lung ventilation (P < 0.05). SpO2 and PaO2 in Group B were significantly higher than in group D after cardiopulmonary bypass (P < 0.05). No short-term postoperative complications were observed in patients of Groups B and D during 3 month follow-up. CONCLUSION BB can be a potential alternative to the conventional DLT for lung isolation in MICS. TRIAL REGISTRATION ChiCTR1900024250, July 2, 2019.

Phenotypic heterogeneity by site of infection in surgical sepsis: a prospective longitudinal study

BACKGROUND: The role of site of infection in sepsis has been poorly characterized. Additionally, sepsis epidemiology has evolved. Early mortality has decreased, but many survivors now progress into chronic critical illness (CCI). This study sought to determine if there were significant differences in the host response and current epidemiology of surgical sepsis categorized by site of infection. STUDY DESIGN: This is a longitudinal study of surgical sepsis patients characterized by baseline predisposition, insult characteristics, serial biomarkers, hospital outcomes, and long-term outcomes. Patients were categorized into five anatomic sites of infection. RESULTS: The 316 study patients were predominantly Caucasian; half were male, with a mean age of 62 years, high comorbidity burden, and low 30-day mortality (10%). The primary sites were abdominal (44%), pulmonary (19%), skin/soft tissue (S/ST, 17%), genitourinary (GU, 12%), and vascular (7%). Most abdominal infections were present on admission and required source control. Comparatively, they had more prolonged proinflammation, immunosuppression, and persistent organ dysfunction. Their long-term outcome was poor with 37% CCI (defined as > 14 in ICU with organ dysfunction), 49% poor discharge dispositions, and 30% 1-year mortality. Most pulmonary infections were hospital-acquired pneumonia. They had similar protracted proinflammation and organ dysfunction, but immunosuppression normalized. Long-term outcomes are similarly poor (54% CCI, 47% poor disposition, 32% 1-year mortality). S/ST and GU infections occurred in younger patients with fewer comorbidities, less perturbed immune responses, and faster resolution of organ dysfunction. Comparatively, S/ST had better long-term outcomes (23% CCI, 39% poor disposition, 13% 1-year mortality) and GU had the best (10% CCI, 20% poor disposition, 10% 1-year mortality). Vascular sepsis patients were older males, with more comorbidities. Proinflammation was blunted with baseline immunosuppression and organ dysfunction that persisted. They had the worst long-term outcomes (38% CCI, 67% poor disposition, 57% 1-year mortality). CONCLUSION: There are notable differences in baseline predisposition, host responses, and clinical outcomes by site of infection in surgical sepsis. While previous studies have focused on differences in hospital mortality, this study provides unique insights into the host response and long-term outcomes associated with different sites of infection.

Blood Component Transfusion in a Tertiary Care Hospital

OBJECTIVES: To study the rational use of the blood components in pediatric and neonatal wards. METHODS: It was a retrospective study conducted by department of pediatrics of a tertiary care centre in western part of India. The patients were included from the pediatric ward, pediatric surgery ward, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) over a period of three months. All the patients below 12 y of age receiving blood components, admitted in general pediatric wards, pediatric intensive care unit, neonatal intensive care unit and pediatric surgery ward were included in the study. Each transfusion episode was assessed as per predetermined guidelines. RESULTS: Of the total 336 episodes of blood component transfusions, 244 episodes were appropriate and 92 episodes were inappropriate. Among these, platelets had highest inappropriate (36.84%) episodes followed by fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (28.95%) and packed red blood cell transfusions (PRBC) (21.21%). Majority inappropriate transfusions were seen in intensive care settings. CONCLUSIONS: Almost one-third of blood component transfusions (FFP, platelets and PRBC) were given without any definitive indication. Judicious use of various blood products by following recommended guidelines may help in decreasing the inappropriate use of blood components.

Survival in adult inpatients with COVID-19

We conducted a nationwide and retrospective cohort study to assess the survival experience and determining factors in adult inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Data from 5,393 individuals were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and a multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model was fitted. The 7-day survival was 0.822 and went to 0.482, 0.280, and 0.145 on days 15, 21, and 30 of hospital stay, respectively. In the multiple analysis, factors associated with an increased risk of dying were: male gender, age, longer disease evolution before hospital entry, exposure to mechanical ventilator support, and personal history of chronic noncommunicable diseases (namely obesity, type-2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing the survival probability in a large subset of Latin-American adults with COVID-19 and our results contribute to achieving a better understanding of disease evolution.

The Ecology of Pathogen Spillover and Disease Emergence at the Human-Wildlife-Environment Interface

Novel diseases are increasingly emerging into human populations through the complex—and often, unseen—stepwise process of spillover from a combination of wildlife, livestock, vectors, and the abiotic environment. Characterizing and modeling the spillover interface are a key part of how eco-epidemiologists respond to the growing global burden of emerging infectious diseases; but the diversity of pathogen life cycles and transmission modes poses a complex challenge for ecologists and clinicians alike. We review our current understanding of the spillover process and present a framework that relates spillover rates and human-to-human transmissibility to the basic reproduction number (R (0)). Using pathogens that exemplify important transmission pathways (anthrax, Ebola, influenza, and Zika), we illustrate key aspects of the spillover interface and discuss implications to public health and management of emerging infectious disease.

Ultrastructural Localization and Molecular Associations of HCV Capsid Protein in Jurkat T Cells

Hepatitis C virus core protein is a highly basic viral protein that multimerizes with itself to form the viral capsid. When expressed in CD4(+) T lymphocytes, it can induce modifications in several essential cellular and biological networks. To shed light on the mechanisms underlying the alterations caused by the viral protein, we have analyzed HCV-core subcellular localization and its associations with host proteins in Jurkat T cells. In order to investigate the intracellular localization of Hepatitis C virus core protein, we have used a lentiviral system to transduce Jurkat T cells and subsequently localize the protein using immunoelectron microscopy techniques. We found that in Jurkat T cells, Hepatitis C virus core protein mostly localizes in the nucleus and specifically in the nucleolus. In addition, we performed pull-down assays combined with Mass Spectrometry Analysis, to identify proteins that associate with Hepatitis C virus core in Jurkat T cells. We found proteins such as NOLC1, PP1γ, ILF3, and C1QBP implicated in localization and/or traffic to the nucleolus. HCV-core associated proteins are implicated in RNA processing and RNA virus infection as well as in functions previously shown to be altered in Hepatitis C virus core expressing CD4(+) T cells, such as cell cycle delay, decreased proliferation, and induction of a regulatory phenotype. Thus, in the current work, we show the ultrastructural localization of Hepatitis C virus core and the first profile of HCV core associated proteins in T cells, and we discuss the functions and interconnections of these proteins in molecular networks where relevant biological modifications have been described upon the expression of Hepatitis C virus core protein. Thereby, the current work constitutes a necessary step toward understanding the mechanisms underlying HCV core mediated alterations that had been described in relevant biological processes in CD4(+) T cells.

COVID-19 and animals: What do we know?

Coronaviruses, which were generally considered harmless to humans before 2003, have appeared again with a pandemic threatening the world since December 2019 after the epidemics of SARS and MERS. It is known that transmission from person to person is the most important way to spread. However, due to the widespread host diversity, a detailed examination of the role of animals in this pandemic is essential to effectively fight against the outbreak. Although coronavirus infections in pets are known to be predominantly related to the gastrointestinal tract, it has been observed that there are human-to-animal transmissions in this outbreak and some animals have similar symptoms to humans. Although animal-to-animal transmission has been shown to be possible, there is no evidence of animal-to-human transmission.

Isolation of the subunits of the coronavirus envelope glycoprotein E2 by hydroxyapatite high-performance liquid chromatography

Abstract The coronavirus glycoprotein E2, which is responsible for virus attachment to cell receptors and virus-induced cell fusion, was purified by solubilization of virions with Triton X-114 and phase fractionation. Native E2 and tryptic subunits of the glycoprotein were separated by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Two distinct 90 kD E2 subunits, which had identified elecrophoretic mobilities when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were separated by hydroxyapetite HPLC in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate.

Heterogeneous contact networks in COVID-19 spreading: the role of social deprivation

We have two main aims in this paper. First we use theories of disease spreading on networks to look at the COVID-19 epidemic on the basis of individual contacts -- these give rise to predictions which are often rather different from the homogeneous mixing approaches usually used. Our second aim is to look at the role of social deprivation, again using networks as our basis, in the spread of this epidemic. We choose the city of Kolkata as a case study, but assert that the insights so obtained are applicable to a wide variety of urban environments which are densely populated and where social inequalities are rampant. Our predictions of hotspots are found to be in good agreement with those currently being identifed empirically as containment zones and provide a useful guide for identifying potential areas of concern.

Expanding the roles of hospitalist physicians to include public health.

Several years after the inception of the hospitalist movement, hospitalist roles have evolved in breadth and sophistication. Although public health is not formally recognized or previously described as an arena for hospitalists, hospitalists are often engaged in public health practice. This article attempts to alert hospitalists to the potential to make contributions to the field of public health and defines the public health skills that can positively affect the lives of their patients and the communities they serve. In a public health role, hospitalists may improve the quality of inpatient care. This article reviews how public health and hospital-based practices have already intersected and proposes further development within this discipline. In our ever-changing health care system, hospitalists play key roles in the central public health domains of assessment, assurance, and policy development. Insightful hospitalists will recognize and embrace these responsibilities in caring for patients and society.

Evaluation of hospital mass screening and infection control practices in a pandemic influenza full-scale exercise.

OBJECTIVE Nonpharmacologic interventions such as limiting nosocomial spread have been suggested for mitigation of respiratory epidemics at health care facilities. This observational study tested the efficacy of a mass screening, isolation, and triage protocol in correctly identifying and placing in a cohort exercise subjects according to case status in the emergency departments at 3 acute care hospitals in Brooklyn, New York, during a simulated pandemic influenza outbreak. METHODS During a 1-day, full-scale exercise using 354 volunteer victims, variables assessing adherence to the mass screening protocol and infection control recommendations were evaluated using standardized forms. RESULTS While all hospitals were able to apply the suggested mass screening protocol for separation based on case status, significant differences were observed in several infection control variables among participating hospitals and different hospital areas. CONCLUSIONS Implementation of mass screening and other infection control interventions during a hospital full-scale exercise was feasible and resulted in measurable outcomes. Hospital drills may be an effective way of detecting and addressing variability in following infection control recommendations.

COVID-19 in the UK and Occupational Health and Safety: Predictable not Inevitable Failures by Government, and Trade Union and Nongovernmental Organization Responses.

This commentary examines the occupational health and safety issues faced by the UK workers in the COVID-19 pandemic, against the background of government cuts in health care and in occupational health and safety budgets, and a deregulatory climate. The UK government has been obsessed, blinkered, and distracted by the desire to leave the European Union (Brexit). The state of knowledge about the virus, especially from international agencies that identified pandemic threats and strategies to combat it, is outlined. UK politicians, government bodies, medical and scientific advisors, and employers periodically ignored or abused that knowledge. Regulatory and ministerial inaction and errors on the workplace virus risks emerged. In contrast, several trade unions, health professional bodies, and nongovernmental organizations identified COVID-19 threats from poor personal protection equipment, working practices, and knowledge gaps and offered solutions for health care workers, social care workers, production workers, and service workers in "essential" occupations.

Is Energy Delivery Guided by Indirect Calorimetry Associated With Improved Clinical Outcomes in Critically Ill Patients? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

Background Indirect calorimetry (IC) is recommended to guide energy delivery over predictive equations in critical illness due to its precision. However, the impact of using IC to measure energy expenditure on clinical outcomes is uncertain. Objective To evaluate whether using IC to measure energy expenditure to inform energy delivery reduced hospital mortality and improved other important outcomes compared to using predictive equations in critically ill adults. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guideline. Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies using IC to guide energy delivery compared to a predictive equation in adult critically ill patients with the primary outcome (hospital mortality) or any of the secondary outcomes reported (including but not limited to hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) and duration mechanical ventilation (MV). Risk of bias within studies was assessed using the Cochrane "Risk of Bias" 1 tool. Random-effect meta-analyses were used when heterogeneity between studies existed (I2 > 50%). Data are reported as median (interquartile range [IQR]), binomial outcomes as odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD). Results Of 4060 articles, 4 randomized controlled trials were identified with 396 patients included in analysis. Three studies were considered low risk of bias and 1 as high risk. Two studies reported hospital mortality (n = 130 and 40 participants, respectively). When combined, no association between IC-guided energy delivery and hospital mortality was found (OR = 0.81, 95% CI = [0.25, 2.67], P = 0.73, I2 = 52). No differences were reported with ICU mortality and hospital LOS between groups, but ICU LOS and duration of MV varied across all studies. According to the meta-analysis, no differences were observed in ICU LOS (MD = 1.39, 95% CI = [-5.01, 7.79], P = 0.67, I2 = 81%), although the duration of MV was increased when energy delivery was guided by IC (MD = 2.01, 95% CI = [0.45, 3.57], P = 0.01, I2 = 26%). In all 4 studies, prescribed energy targets were more closely met when energy delivery was informed by IC compared to a predictive equation. Three studies reported the percentage delivered versus the prescribed energy target, with the median (IQR) delta between the IC and predictive equation arms 19% (10%-32%). Conclusion Limited data exist to assess the impact of using IC to inform energy delivery in comparison to predictive equations on hospital mortality. The association of IC use with other important outcomes, including duration of MV, needs to be further explored before definitive conclusions can be made.

Canine morbillivirus (canine distemper virus) with concomitant canine adenovirus, canine parvovirus-2, and Neospora caninum in puppies: a retrospective immunohistochemical study

A retrospective immunohistochemical study was designed to investigate the frequency of concomitant traditional infectious disease pathogens in puppies that died suddenly and review the aspects of associated pathogenesis. Fifteen puppies were evaluated; the pathology reports and histopathologic slides of these animals were reviewed to determine the pattern of histopathologic lesions. The intralesional identification of antigens of canine (distemper) morbillivirus (CDV), canine adenovirus-1 and -2 (CAdV-1 and -2), canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2), Toxoplasma gondii, and Neospora caninum was evaluated by IHC within the histopathologic patterns observed. All puppies contained CDV nucleic acid by molecular testing. The most frequent histopathologic patterns were intestinal crypt necrosis (n = 8), white matter cerebellar demyelination (n = 7), necrohaemorrhagic hepatitis (n = 7), interstitial pneumonia (n = 7), and gallbladder oedema (n = 5). All puppies contained intralesional antigens of CDV in multiple tissues resulting in singular (n = 3), and concomitant dual (n = 3), triple (n = 5) and quadruple (n = 4) infections by CAdV-1, and -2, CPV-2, and N. caninum; T. gondii was not identified. Concomitant infections by CDV was observed with N. caninum (100%; 1/1), CPV-2 (100%; 8/8), CAdV-1 (100%; 8/8), and CAdV-2 (100%; 8/8). Intralesional antigens of CDV and not CAdV-1 were identified in cases of gallbladder oedema. The “blue eye” phenomenon was histologically characterized by corneal oedema and degenerative lesions to the corneal epithelium, without inflammatory reactions.

Treatments for COVID-19: emerging drugs against the coronavirus

The Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak has been recognized as a global threat to public health. It is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and no effective therapies currently exist against this novel viral agent. Along with extensive public health measures, an unprecedented global effort in identifying effective drugs for the treatment is being implemented. Potential drug targets are emerging as the result of a fast-evolving understanding of SARS-CoV-2 virology, host response to the infection, and clinical course of the disease. This brief review focuses on the latest and most promising pharmacological treatments against COVID-19 currently under investigation and discuss their potential use based on either documented efficacy in similar viral infections, or their activity against inflammatory syndromes. Ongoing clinical trials are also emphasized.

Early experience with barbed sutures for abdominal closure in deep inferior epigastric perforator flap breast reconstruction.

OBJECTIVE Barbed sutures have recently been introduced for closure of surgical incisions. These self-anchoring sutures incorporate evenly spaced barbs in a circumferential distribution along their length, facilitating knotless wound closure and even distribution of tension along the suture line. In this study, we evaluated postoperative complications associated with the use of unidirectional barbed sutures compared with standard sutures for closure of the abdominal incision in deep inferior epigastric perforator flap breast reconstruction. METHODS A consecutive series of 142 patients undergoing deep inferior epigastric perforator flap breast reconstruction were identified at a single institution. The abdominal closure in the first 71 patients was performed using standard suture materials. In the subsequent 71 patients, closure was performed using unidirectional barbed sutures. Patient demographics, complications, procedure time, and costs were compared between standard and barbed suture groups. RESULTS Demographic characteristics and comorbidity profiles were similar between the 2 groups. Overall, there was a significantly higher incidence of complications in the standard suture group (17 vs 7 complications,P = .0423). Similar rates of wound infection (P = .4412), wound dehiscence (P = .4934), and seroma (P = .1157) were recorded in both groups. Barbed sutures were $ 15.58 more expensive than standard sutures. No significant difference in total length of operation was observed. CONCLUSION In this study, the utility of unidirectional barbed sutures in deep inferior epigastric perforator flap breast reconstruction has been demonstrated. Barbed sutures may be useful in a broad range of plastic surgery procedures, not only because of their convenience but also based on favorable clinical outcomes.

Tracking the engraftment and regenerative capabilities of transplanted lung stem cells using fluorescent nanodiamonds

Lung stem/progenitor cells are potentially useful for regenerative therapy, for example in repairing damaged or lost lung tissue in patients. Several optical imaging methods and probes have been used to track how stem cells incorporate and regenerate themselves in vivo over time. However, these approaches are limited by photobleaching, toxicity and interference from background tissue autofluorescence. Here we show that fluorescent nanodiamonds, in combination with fluorescence-activated cell sorting, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and immunostaining, can identify transplanted CD45(–)CD54(+)CD157(+) lung stem/progenitor cells in vivo, and track their engraftment and regenerative capabilities with single-cell resolution. Fluorescent nanodiamond labelling did not eliminate the cells’ properties of self-renewal and differentiation into type I and type II pneumocytes. Time-gated fluorescence imaging of tissue sections of naphthalene-injured mice indicates that the fluorescent nanodiamond-labelled lung stem/progenitor cells preferentially reside at terminal bronchioles of the lungs for 7 days after intravenous transplantation.

Hospital-Associated Infections in Small Animal Practice

Hospital-associated infections (HAIs) occur in veterinary hospitals of all types and sizes, and their frequency is likely to increase. Urinary tract infections, pneumonia, bloodstream infections, surgical site infections, and infectious diarrhea are the HAIs most frequently identified in veterinary medicine. A hospital infection control program, consisting of an infectious disease control officer, written protocols, and staff training, is critical to reducing HAIs and promoting patient, staff, and client health. Infection control protocols (plans) should include discussion of hand hygiene and use of personal protective equipment, cleaning and disinfection, patient management, with-in hospital surveillance, and antimicrobial stewardship.

COVID-19 Utilization and Resource Visualization Engine (CURVE) to Forecast In-Hospital Resources

Background: The emergence of COVID-19 has created an urgent threat to public health worldwide. With rapidly evolving demands on healthcare resources, it is imperative that healthcare systems have the ability to access real-time local data to predict, plan, and effectively manage resources. Objective: To develop an interactive COVID-19 Utilization and Resource Visualization Engine (CURVE) as a data visualization tool to inform decision making and guide a large health system's proactive pandemic response. Methods: We designed and implemented CURVE using R Shiny to display real-time parameters of healthcare utilization at Atrium Health with projections based upon locally derived models for the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the CURVE app to compare predictions from two of our models: one created before and one after the statewide stay-at-home and social distancing orders (denoted before- and after-SAH-order model). We established parameter settings for best-, moderate-, and worst-case scenarios for pandemic spread and resource use, leveraging two locally developed forecasting models to determine peak date trajectory, resource use, and root mean square error (RMSE) between observed and predicted results. Results: CURVE predicts and monitors utilization of hospital beds, ICU beds, and number of ventilators in the context of up-to-date local resources and provides Atrium Health leadership with timely, actionable insights to guide decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. The after-SAH-order model demonstrated the lowest RMSE in total bed, ICU bed, and patients on ventilators. Conclusions: CURVE provides a powerful, interactive interface that provides locally relevant, dynamic, timely information to guide health system decision making and pandemic preparedness.

Crystal structure of the natural anion-conducting channelrhodopsin GtACR1

The naturally occurring channelrhodopsin variant anion channelrhodopsin-1 (ACR1), discovered in the cryptophyte algae Guillardia theta, exhibits large light-gated anion conductance and high anion selectivity when expressed in heterologous settings, properties that support its use as an optogenetic tool to inhibit neuronal firing with light. However, molecular insight into ACR1 is lacking owing to the absence of structural information underlying light-gated anion conductance. Here we present the crystal structure of G. theta ACR1 at 2.9 Å resolution. The structure reveals unusual architectural features that span the extracellular domain, retinal-binding pocket, Schiff-base region, and anion-conduction pathway. Together with electrophysiological and spectroscopic analyses, these findings reveal the fundamental molecular basis of naturally occurring light-gated anion conductance, and provide a framework for designing the next generation of optogenetic tools.

Epigenetic Effect of Environmental Factors on Autism Spectrum Disorders

Both environmental factors and genetic factors are involved in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Epigenetics, an essential mechanism for gene regulation based on chemical modifications of DNA and histone proteins, is also involved in congenital ASDs. It was recently demonstrated that environmental factors, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals and mental stress in early life, can change epigenetic status and gene expression, and can cause ASDs. Moreover, environmentally induced epigenetic changes are not erased during gametogenesis and are transmitted to subsequent generations, leading to changes in behavior phenotypes. However, epigenetics has a reversible nature since it is based on the addition or removal of chemical residues, and thus the original epigenetic status may be restored. Indeed, several antidepressants and anticonvulsants used for mental disorders including ASDs restore the epigenetic state and gene expression. Therefore, further epigenetic understanding of ASDs is important for the development of new drugs that take advantages of epigenetic reversibility.

A Conceptual Framework for Human–AI Hybrid Adaptivity in Education

Educational AI (AIEd) systems are increasingly designed and evaluated with an awareness of the hybrid nature of adaptivity in real-world educational settings. In practice, beyond being a property of AIEd systems alone, adaptivity is often jointly enacted by AI systems and human facilitators (e.g., teachers or peers). Despite much recent research activity, theoretical and conceptual guidance for the design of such human–AI systems remains limited. In this paper we explore how adaptivity may be shared across AIEd systems and the various human stakeholders who work with them. Based on a comparison of prior frameworks, which tend to examine adaptivity in AIEd systems or human coaches separately, we first synthesize a set of dimensions general enough to capture human–AI hybrid adaptivity. Using these dimensions, we then present a conceptual framework to map distinct ways in which humans and AIEd systems can augment each other’s abilities. Through examples, we illustrate how this framework can be used to characterize prior work and envision new possibilities for human–AI hybrid approaches in education.

Mortality and pulmonary complications in patients undergoing surgery with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection: an international cohort study

BACKGROUND: The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on postoperative recovery needs to be understood to inform clinical decision making during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. This study reports 30-day mortality and pulmonary complication rates in patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This international, multicentre, cohort study at 235 hospitals in 24 countries included all patients undergoing surgery who had SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed within 7 days before or 30 days after surgery. The primary outcome measure was 30-day postoperative mortality and was assessed in all enrolled patients. The main secondary outcome measure was pulmonary complications, defined as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or unexpected postoperative ventilation. FINDINGS: This analysis includes 1128 patients who had surgery between Jan 1 and March 31, 2020, of whom 835 (74·0%) had emergency surgery and 280 (24·8%) had elective surgery. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed preoperatively in 294 (26·1%) patients. 30-day mortality was 23·8% (268 of 1128). Pulmonary complications occurred in 577 (51·2%) of 1128 patients; 30-day mortality in these patients was 38·0% (219 of 577), accounting for 82·6% (219 of 265) of all deaths. In adjusted analyses, 30-day mortality was associated with male sex (odds ratio 1·75 [95% CI 1·28–2·40], p<0·0001), age 70 years or older versus younger than 70 years (2·30 [1·65–3·22], p<0·0001), American Society of Anesthesiologists grades 3–5 versus grades 1–2 (2·35 [1·57–3·53], p<0·0001), malignant versus benign or obstetric diagnosis (1·55 [1·01–2·39], p=0·046), emergency versus elective surgery (1·67 [1·06–2·63], p=0·026), and major versus minor surgery (1·52 [1·01–2·31], p=0·047). INTERPRETATION: Postoperative pulmonary complications occur in half of patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection and are associated with high mortality. Thresholds for surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic should be higher than during normal practice, particularly in men aged 70 years and older. Consideration should be given for postponing non-urgent procedures and promoting non-operative treatment to delay or avoid the need for surgery.

Local delivery of siRNA-loaded calcium phosphate nanoparticles abates pulmonary inflammation

Abstract The local interference of cytokine signaling mediated by siRNA-loaded nanoparticles might be a promising new therapeutic approach to dampen inflammation during pulmonary diseases. For the local therapeutic treatment of pulmonary inflammation, we produced multi-shell nanoparticles consisting of a calcium phosphate core, coated with siRNAs directed against pro-inflammatory mediators, encapsulated into poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), and coated with a final outer layer of polyethylenimine. Nasal instillation of nanoparticles loaded with a mixture of siRNAs directed against different cytokines to mice suffering from TH1 cell-mediated lung inflammation, or of siRNA directed against NS-1 in an influenza infection model led to a significant reduction of target gene expression which was accompanied by distinct amelioration of lung inflammation in both models. Thus, this study provides strong evidence that the specific and local modulation of the inflammatory response by CaP/PLGA nanoparticle-mediated siRNA delivery could be a promising approach for the treatment of inflammatory disorders of the lung.

Recombinant protein subunit vaccine synthesis in microbes: a role for yeast?

OBJECTIVES Recombinant protein subunit vaccines are formulated using protein antigens that have been synthesized in heterologous host cells. Several host cells are available for this purpose, ranging from Escherichia coli to mammalian cell lines. This article highlights the benefits of using yeast as the recombinant host. KEY FINDINGS The yeast species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris, have been used to optimize the functional yields of potential antigens for the development of subunit vaccines against a wide range of diseases caused by bacteria and viruses. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has also been used in the manufacture of 11 approved vaccines against hepatitis B virus and one against human papillomavirus; in both cases, the recombinant protein forms highly immunogenic virus-like particles. SUMMARY Advances in our understanding of how a yeast cell responds to the metabolic load of producing recombinant proteins will allow us to identify host strains that have improved yield properties and enable the synthesis of more challenging antigens that cannot be produced in other systems. Yeasts therefore have the potential to become important host organisms for the production of recombinant antigens that can be used in the manufacture of subunit vaccines or in new vaccine development.

The Difficult Airway and Aerosol-Generating Procedures in COVID-19: Timeless Principles for Uncertain Times

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on otolaryngology practice is nowhere more evident than in acute airway management. Considerations of preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, conserving personal protective equipment, and prioritizing care delivery based on acuity have dictated clinical decision making in the acute phase of the pandemic. With transition to a more chronic state of pandemic, heightened vigilance is necessary to recognize how deferral of care in patients with tenuous airways and COVID-19 infection may lead to acute airway compromise. Furthermore, it is critical to respect the continuing importance of flexible laryngoscopy in diagnosis. Safely managing airways during the pandemic requires thoughtful multidisciplinary planning. Teams should consider trade-offs among aerosol-generating procedures involving direct laryngoscopy, supraglottic airway use, fiberoptic intubation, and tracheostomy. We share clinical cases that illustrate enduring principles of acute airway management. As algorithms evolve, time-honored approaches for diagnosis and management of acute airway pathology remain essential in ensuring patient safety.

Risk-Based AED Placement - Singapore Case

This paper presents a novel risk-based method for Automated External Defibrillator (AED) placement. In sudden cardiac events, availability of a nearby AED is crucial for the surviving of cardiac arrest patients. The common method uses historical Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) data for AED placement optimization. But historical data often do not cover the entire area of investigation. The goal of this work is to develop an approach to improve the method based on historical data for AED placement. To this end, we have developed a risk-based method which generates artificial OHCAs based on a risk model. We compare our risk-based method with the one based on historical data using real Singapore OHCA occurrences from Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcome Study (PAROS). Results show that to deploy a large number of AEDs the risk-based method outperforms the method purely using historical data on the testing dataset. This paper describes our risk-based AED placement method, discusses experimental results, and outlines future work.

Incidence and prognosis of early hepatic dysfunction in critically ill patients--a prospective multicenter study.

OBJECTIVE In critically ill patients, hepatic dysfunction is regarded as a late organ failure associated with poor prognosis. We investigated the incidence and prognostic implications of early hepatic dysfunction (serum bilirubin >2 mg/dL within 48 hrs of admission). DESIGN Prospective, multicenter cohort study. SETTING Thirty-two medical, surgical, and mixed intensive care units. PATIENTS A total of 38,036 adult patients admitted consecutively over a period of 4 yrs. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Excluding patients with preexisting cirrhosis (n = 691; 1.8%) and acute or acute-on-chronic hepatic failure (n = 108, 0.3%), we identified 4,146 patients (10.9%) with early hepatic dysfunction. These patients had different baseline characteristics, longer median intensive care unit stays (5 vs. 3 days; p < .001) and increased hospital mortality (30.4% vs. 16.4%; p < .001). Hepatic dysfunction was also associated with higher observed-to-expected mortality ratios (1.02 vs. 0.91; p < .001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed an independent mortality risk of hepatic dysfunction (odds ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.71-2.03; p < .001), which exceeded the impact of all other organ dysfunctions. A case-control study further confirmed these results: Patients with early hepatic dysfunction exhibited significantly increased raw and risk-adjusted mortality compared with control subjects. CONCLUSIONS Our results provide strong evidence that early hepatic dysfunction, occurring in 11% of critically ill patients, presents a specific and independent risk factor for poor prognosis.

Importance of the evaluation of systemic microvascular flow and reactivity in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 - COVID-19

Amidst the pandemic that has mesmerized the entire world, as it has not spared anyone according to any specific characteristic, some conditions have, in fact, emerged as risk factors for a complicated evolution of COVID-19. Older age, cardiovascular disease including hypertension, diabetes and pulmonary disease, have been associated with more severe presentations and/or adverse prognosis. In this letter to the editor, we propose that the link between cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and the higher incidence and worse prognosis of COVID-19 patients is the (micro) vascular endothelium.

Cyclophilin A Associates with Enterovirus-71 Virus Capsid and Plays an Essential Role in Viral Infection as an Uncoating Regulator

Viruses utilize host factors for their efficient proliferation. By evaluating the inhibitory effects of compounds in our library, we identified inhibitors of cyclophilin A (CypA), a known immunosuppressor with peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity, can significantly attenuate EV71 proliferation. We demonstrated that CypA played an essential role in EV71 entry and that the RNA interference-mediated reduction of endogenous CypA expression led to decreased EV71 multiplication. We further revealed that CypA directly interacted with and modified the conformation of H-I loop of the VP1 protein in EV71 capsid, and thus regulated the uncoating process of EV71 entry step in a pH-dependent manner.

SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution exposes early human adaptations

The set of mutations observed at the outset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may illuminate how the virus will adapt to humans as it continues to spread. Viruses are expected to quickly acquire beneficial mutations upon jumping to a new host species. Advantageous nucleotide substitutions can be identified by their parallel occurrence in multiple independent lineages and are likely to result in changes to protein sequences. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is acquiring mutations more slowly than expected for neutral evolution, suggesting purifying selection is the dominant mode of evolution during the initial phase of the pandemic. However, several parallel mutations arose in multiple independent lineages and may provide a fitness advantage over the ancestral genome. We propose plausible reasons for several of the most frequent mutations. The absence of mutations in other genome regions suggests essential components of SARS-CoV-2 that could be the target of drug development. Overall this study provides genomic insights into how SARS-CoV-2 has adapted and will continue to adapt to humans. SUMMARY In this study we sought signals of evolution to identify how the SARS-CoV-2 genome has adapted at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that the genome is largely undergoing purifying selection that maintains its ancestral sequence. However, we identified multiple positions on the genome that appear to confer an adaptive advantage based on their repeated evolution in independent lineages. This information indicates how SARS-CoV-2 will evolve as it diversifies in an increasing number of hosts.

Hyperpolarization following activation of K(+) channels by excitatory postsynaptic potentials

We have postulated that an excitatory postsynaptic potential (e.p.s.p.) may open voltage-sensitive K(+) (‘M’) channels(1), in an appropriate depolarizing range, and that this could alter the e.p.s.p. waveform. Consequently, the fast e.p.s.p. in neurones of sympathetic ganglia, elicited by a nicotinic action of acetylcholine (ACh)(2), could be followed by a hyperpolarization, produced by the opening of M channels during the depolarizing e.p.s.p. and their subsequent slow closure (time constant∼150 ms)(1). This introduces the concept that transmitter-induced p.s.ps may trigger voltage-sensitive conductances other than those initiating action potentials, and that in the present case this could produce a true post-e.p.s.p. hyperpolarization. (Some hyperpolarizations other than inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (i.p.s.ps) have been reported to follow e.p.s.ps(3,4).) We show here that this is so.

Acquired thrombasthenia due to inhibitory effect of glycoprotein IIbIIIa autoantibodies.

BACKGROUND A 75 year old patient presenting with mucocutaneous bleeding was diagnosed with acquired thrombasthenia. The diagnosis was based on lack of platelet aggregation with adenosine diphosphate (ADP), arachidonic acid and collagen, and normal aggregation induced by ristocetin. OBJECTIVE To study the mechanism of platelet function inhibition in a patient with acquired thrombasthenia. METHODS Aggregation assays of platelets from the patient and healthy controls were performed. In addition, anti-glycoprotein (GP) IIbIIIa antibodies bindingto normal in the presence or absence of the patient's serum was by flow cytometry. RESULTS Aggregation of normal platelets in the presence of patient's plasma was inhibited four- and 2.5-fold in the presence of ADP and arachidonic acid respectively, while collagen-induced aggregation was completely abolished. Ristocetin-induced aggregation was normal. The patient's serum inhibited binding of commercial anti-glycoprotein IIbIIIa antibodies to normal platelets twofold by flow cytometry. Treatment with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) normalized the patient's platelet aggregation. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that the patient developed inhibitory anti-GPIIbIIIa autoantibodies that caused acquired thrombasthenia.

Treatment of Argentine hemorrhagic fever

Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) is a rodent-borne illness caused by the arenavirus Junin that is endemic to the humid pampas of Argentina. AHF has had significant morbidity since its emergence in the 1950s, with a case-fatality rate of the illness without treatment between 15% and 30%. The use of a live attenuated vaccine has markedly reduced the incidence of AHF. Present specific therapy involves the transfusion of immune plasma in defined doses of neutralizing antibodies during the prodromal phase of illness. However, alternative forms of treatment are called for due to current difficulties in early detection of AHF, related to its decrease in incidence, troubles in maintaining adequate stocks of immune plasma, and the absence of effective therapies for severely ill patients that progress to a neurologic–hemorrhagic phase. Ribavirin might be a substitute for immune plasma, provided that the supply is guaranteed. Immune immunoglobulin or monoclonal antibodies should also be considered. New therapeutic options such as those being developed for systemic inflammatory syndromes should also be valuated in severe forms of AHF.

Symptom Severity Patterns in Experimental Common Colds and Their Usefulness in Timing Onset of Illness in Natural Colds

Mean total symptom severity scores for subjects with experimental rhinovirus colds peak 48 h after viral inoculation. Also, total symptom scores for natural rhinovirus and nonrhinovirus colds peaked on day 2 of illness in a long-term, noncompensated epidemiology study. In contrast, the mean total symptom scores for compensated patients receiving placebo in natural cold treatment trials peaked on day 1. Comparisons by day indicated that scores for symptoms reported as occurring on day 1 in the natural cold treatment trials corresponded with experimental cold scores for symptoms reported 48 h after viral inoculation. Comparisons of frequency and cumulative distribution scores for the 2 groups indicated that natural colds in the treatment trials were of longer duration than reported. A mean total symptom severity score of ⩽7 would capture 95% of experimental colds 24 h after inoculation while excluding 30.5% of natural colds on day 1 of illness. Histories given by compensated patients in natural cold treatment trials are inaccurate.

Bereavement in the Time of Coronavirus: Unprecedented Challenges Demand Novel Interventions.

COVID-19 fatalities exemplify "bad deaths" and are distinguished by physical discomfort, difficulty breathing, social isolation, psychological distress, and care that may be discordant with the patient's preferences. Each of these death attributes is a well-documented correlate of bereaved survivors' symptoms of depression, anxiety, and anger. Yet the grief experienced by survivors of COVID-related deaths is compounded by the erosion of coping resources like social support, contemporaneous stressors including social isolation, financial precarity, uncertainty about the future, lack of routine, and the loss of face-to-face mourning rituals that provide a sense of community and uplift. National efforts to enhance advance care planning may help dying patients to receive care that is concordant with the preferences of them and their families. Virtual funeral services, pairing bereaved elders with a telephone companion, remote counseling, and encouraging "continuing bonds" may help older adults adapt to loss in the time of pandemic.

What works and what does not work in response to COVID-19 prevention and control in Africa

Abstract Since the emergence of the pandemic in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, as of 10:00 CEST, June 6, 2020, there have been nearly 6,663,304 confirmed cases of COVID-19 including 392,802 deaths worldwide. In Africa, as of June 2, 2020, a total of 152,442 COVID-19 cases and 4334 deaths have been reported. The five countries with the highest commutative number of cases in Africa are South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Algeria, and Ghana. Africa, together with the rest of world have had to swiftly undertake measures necessary to protect the continent from irreversible effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that is claiming lives and destroying livelihoods. The lower number of COVID-19 cases in most African countries is attributed to inadequate health systems, low-to-absent testing capacity, poor reporting system and insufficient number of medical staff. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a great threat to most African countries from cities to rural areas and has created a strong demand on already scarce resources and requires an intense mobilization of additional resources to implement established emergency contingency measures. Closure of borders and movements of people restrictions within the country as measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19; this has resulted in the sector being adversely affected by the loss of income. Cooperative prevention and control measures are one of the promising solutions to deplete the spread of COVID-19 on the continent.

Patterns of mortality during pandemic: An example of Spanish flu pandemic of 1918

Now the attention of the whole world is focused on the developing pandemic of the coronavirus infection COVID-19. This article discusses mortality patterns of the deadliest epidemic in the last 120 years – the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. Statistical sources from Italy and the USA, published shortly after the pandemic, were analyzed. The analysis was carried out for mortality from all causes, since in this case inaccuracies associated with establishing the causes of death are minimized. Despite the fact that the first cases of the Spanish flu appeared in the United States as early as March 1918, this first wave of epidemic practically did not affect the total mortality rate. The main peak of mortality in 1918 occurred in October 1918 both in the USA and Italy, with a gradual decrease in mortality over several months. Analysis of age-specific mortality demonstrates a significant increase in mortality at middle ages (20–50 years) in 1918 compared with 1917. Analysis of mortality trends using the method of latent variables shows a significant increase in the background mortality factor in 1918, which turned out to be higher for Italy than the mortality losses during the Second World War. The Spanish flu pandemic differs from the current coronavirus pandemic, because of significant increase in mortality of middle-aged people, while the COVID-19 pandemic causes a more marked increase in mortality among the elderly. With this, the COVID-19 pandemic is more like the recent flu epidemics than the earlier Spanish flu pandemic.

Ebola Policies That Hinder Epidemic Response by Limiting Scientific Discourse

There is an unprecedented epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in west Africa. There has been a strong response from dedicated health professionals. However, there have also been irrational and fear-based responses that have contributed to misallocation of resources, stigma, and deincentivizing volunteers to combat Ebola at its source. Recently, the State of Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals issued a ban on those coming from affected countries wishing to attend the annual meetings of American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene and the American Public Health Association, both of which were held in New Orleans. We argue against such policies, question evidence and motivations, and discuss their practical and ethical implications in hampering effective responses to EVD by the scientific community. We aim to shed light on this issue and its implications for the future of public health interventions, reflect on the responsibility of health providers and professional societies as advocates for patients and the public health, and call for health professionals and societies to work to challenge inappropriate political responses to public health crises.

Standardized adult-gerontology acute care nurse practitioner point-of-care ultrasound training: A new perspective in the age of a pandemic.

Our health care landscape is rapidly changing. With the aging population and seemingly increasing outbreak of communicable diseases, it is expected that there will be a continued demand for inpatient/critical care providers. The current COVID-19 pandemic provides a glimpse of a health care system in severe provider shortage. Adult-gerontology acute nurse practitioners (GACNPs) can play a vital part in relieving that shortage. But with the increased role, there is an increased responsibility and need for expansion of AGACNP skill set. This includes the training and utilization of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). The case reports and data available from countries that have already combated COVID-19 outbreak show POCUS can play a key part in managing critically ill patients on isolation precautions. This article provides my perspective on POCUS training and competency achievement for AGACNPPs.

Financial spillover and global risk in a multi-region model of the world economy()

This paper estimates a three-region DSGE model (EA, US, RoW) with international financial linkages in the form of cross-border equity holding and allowing for region-specific as well as global financial shocks, which match empirical measures of financial tightness and global stock market valuation. Spillover from financial shocks increases with international financial integration and is practically zero under full home bias in normal times. The global risk captures international synchronisation of financial cycles. Spillover of financial shocks is amplified at the zero lower bound, at which investment risk takes on the characteristics of a general uncertainty shock. The model results suggest that integrated financial markets should provide a powerful motivation for international policy coordination to prevent financial turmoil.

Efficacy and safety of intravascular lithotripsy for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease: An individual patient-level pooled data analysis.

BACKGROUND Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is one of the most common manifestations of atherosclerotic disease worldwide. Peripheral arterial calcification reduces acute success and long-term patency of endovascular therapy for PAD. Several calcium modification devices are available for use in peripheral interventions. Outcomes after peripheral intravascular lithotripsy (IVL), a novel approach using pulsatile sonic waves to treat luminal and medial calcium in patients with PAD, have not been extensively characterized. Therefore, we sought to perform an individual patient-level data (IPD) pooled analysis of available studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IVL in the treatment of PAD. METHODS AND RESULTS We pooled IPD, including baseline and procedural variables, from five prospective studies which assessed IVL in the treatment of patients with extensive peripheral artery calcification. Final postprocedural percent diameter stenosis (%DS) and procedural angiographic complications were assessed by independent core laboratory. Efficacy endpoints were analyzed using linear mixed effects models and safety endpoints were tabulated overall and by vascular bed. Among 336 patients who underwent endovascular revascularization with use of IVL, there was a significant reduction between pre-procedural and final %DS of 55.1% (95% confidence interval 53.3-57.0%, p < .0001). Core-laboratory assessed lesion-level complications, including flow-limiting dissections (Types D-F), vessel perforation, distal embolization, thrombus, abrupt closure, and no reflow, occurred in 4/328 (1.22%) of treated lesions. CONCLUSIONS The present IPD of five prospective studies, marking the largest analysis to date evaluating the use of IVL in significantly calcified PAD lesions, demonstrates this treatment strategy to be both effective and safe.

Organizational collaborative capacity in fighting pandemic crises: a literature review from the public management perspective.

Collaborative capacity serves for organizations as the capacity to collaborate with other network players. Organizational capacity matters as collaboration outcomes usually go beyond single-shot implementation efforts or a single-minded focus on either the vertical dimension of program or the horizontal component. This review article explores organizational collaborative capacities from the perspective of public management, in particular, network theory. By applying the 5 attributes of network theory-interdependence, membership, resources, information, and learning-to the explanation of collaborative capacity in fighting pandemic crises, I argue in some ways organizational collaborative capacity is very much like an organization in its own right. Studying collaborative capacity in the battle against pandemics facilitate our understanding of multisectoral collaboration in technical, political, and institutional dimensions, and greatly advances the richness of capacity vocabulary in pandemic response and preparedness.

Is sleep apnoea a risk factor for Covid-19? Findings from a retrospective cohort study

Background: In the early phase of the coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19) pandemic, Southwest Finland remained relatively spared. By the 3rd of May 2020, a total of 28 patients have been admitted to the Turku University Hospital. In this paper, we explore baseline characteristics in order to identify risk for severe Covid-19 disease and critical care admission. Methods For this retrospective cohort study, data were derived from hospital records. Basic descriptive statistics were used to characterise patients, including medians, percentiles and frequencies. Differences were tested with Mann Whitney U-test and Pearson's chi-square test. Results Pre-existent obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) was present in 29% of patients admitted in the hospital for Covid-19, none of them having severe OSA. Overall, other findings on admission were comparable with those reported elsewhere. C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were higher in patients who were eventually transferred to critical care in comparison to in those who were not (median CRP 187 mg/L versus 52 mg/L, p<0.005 and median PCT 0.46 versus 0.12, p=0.047). Moreover, there was a trend towards lower oxygen saturation on admission in ICU-patients (87% versus 93%, p=0.09). Discussion OSA was pre-existent in a disproportional large group of patients, which suggests that it is an important risk factor for severe Covid-19. Furthermore, we identified high CRP, PCT and possibly oxygen saturation as useful clinical measures to identify patients at risk for critical care.

Yeast Proteomics and Protein Microarrays

Our understanding of biological processes as well as human diseases has improved greatly thanks to studies on model organisms such as yeast. The power of scientific approaches with yeast lies in its relatively simple genome, its facile classical and molecular genetics, as well as the evolutionary conservation of many basic biological mechanisms. However, even in this simple model organism, systems biology studies, especially proteomic studies had been an intimidating task. During the past decade, powerful high-throughput technologies in proteomic research have been developed for yeast including protein microarray technology. The protein microarray technology allows the interrogation of protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-small molecule interaction networks as well as post-translational modification networks in a large-scale, high-throughput manner. With this technology, many groundbreaking findings have been established in studies with the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, most of which could have been unachievable with traditional approaches. Discovery of these networks has profound impact on explicating biological processes with a proteomic point of view, which may lead to a better understanding of normal biological phenomena as well as various human diseases.

Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Protein (IFITM3) Is Upregulated Explicitly in SARS-CoV-2 Infected Lung Epithelial Cells

Current guidelines for COVID-19 management recommend the utilization of various repurposed drugs. Despite ongoing research toward the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, such a vaccine will not be available in time to contribute to the containment of the ongoing pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a framework for the rapid identification of novel targets for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. We analyzed publicly available transcriptomic datasets of SARS-CoV infected humans and mammals to identify consistent differentially expressed genes then validated in SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cells transcriptomic datasets. Comprehensive toxicogenomic analysis of the identified genes to identify possible interactions with clinically proven drugs was carried out. We identified IFITM3 as an early upregulated gene, and valproic acid was found to enhance its mRNA expression as well as induce its antiviral action. These findings indicate that analysis of publicly available transcriptomic and toxicogenomic data represents a rapid approach for the identification of novel targets and molecules that can modify the action of such targets during the early phases of emerging infections like COVID-19.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using commercial assays and seroconversion patterns in hospitalized patients

OBJECTIVES: SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays are needed for serological surveys and as a complement to molecular tests to confirm COVID-19. However, the kinetics of the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 remains poorly described and relies on the performance of the different serological tests. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the performance of six CE-marked point-of-care tests (POC) and three ELISA assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19 by exploring seroconversions in hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Both the ELISA and POC tests were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at least half of the samples collected seven days or more after the onset of symptoms. After 15 days, the rate of detection rose to over 80% but without reaching 100%, irrespective of the test used. More than 90% of the samples collected after 15 days tested positive using the iSIA and Accu-Tell® POC tests and the ID.Vet IgG ELISA assay. Seroconversion was observed 5 to 12 days after the onset of symptoms. Three assays suffer from a specificity below 90% (EUROIMMUN IgG and IgA, UNscience, Zhuhai Livzon). CONCLUSIONS: The second week of COVID-19 seems to be the best period for assessing the sensitivity of commercial serological assays. To achieve an early diagnosis of COVID-19 based on antibody detection, a dual challenge must be met: the immunodiagnostic window period must be shortened and an optimal specificity must be conserved.

Genetic stability of Schmallenberg virus in vivo during an epidemic, and in vitro, when passaged in the highly susceptible porcine SK-6 cell line

Abstract Schmallenberg virus (SBV), an arthropod-borne orthobunyavirus was first detected in 2011 in cattle suffering from diarrhea and fever. The most severe impact of an SBV infection is the induction of malformations in newborns and abortions. Between 2011 and 2013 SBV spread throughout Europe in an unprecedented epidemic wave. SBV contains a tripartite genome consisting of the three negative-sense RNA segments L, M, and S. The virus is usually isolated from clinical samples by inoculation of KC (insect) or BHK-21 (mammalian) cells. Several virus passages are required to allow adaptation of SBV to cells in vitro. In the present study, the porcine SK-6 cell line was used for isolation and passaging of SBV. SK-6 cells proved to be more sensitive to SBV infection and allowed to produce higher titers more rapidly as in BHK-21 cells after just one passage. No adaptation was required. In order to determine the in vivo genetic stability of SBV during an epidemic spread of the virus the nucleotide sequence of the genome from seven SBV field isolates collected in summer 2012 in Switzerland was determined and compared to other SBV sequences available in GenBank. A total of 101 mutations, mostly transitions randomly dispersed along the L and M segment were found when the Swiss isolates were compared to the first SBV isolated late 2011 in Germany. However, when these mutations were studied in detail, a previously described hypervariable region in the M segment was identified. The S segment was completely conserved among all sequenced SBV isolates. To assess the in vitro genetic stability of SBV, three isolates were passage 10 times in SK-6 cells and sequenced before and after passaging. Between two and five nt exchanges per genome were found. This low in vitro mutation rate further demonstrates the suitability of SK-6 cells for SBV propagation.

Identification of 9-O acetyl sialoglycoconjugates (9-OAcSGs) as biomarkers in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia using a lectin, Achatinin(H), as a probe

Neoplastic transformation causes changes in cell surface architecture, most notably, aberrant sialylation. Exploiting the restricted specificity of a 9-O acetyl sialic acid (9-OAcSA) binding lectin, Achatinin(H) (ATN(H)), we have identified two 9-O acetyl sialoglyconjugates (9-OAcSGs) on lymphoblasts of 87 children suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The preferential binding of ATN(H) to lymphoblasts induces their 11-fold increased agglutination (81 ± 7.8%) compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of normal donors (8 ± 4.3%) which corroborates with flow cytometry studies. Agglutination of MOLT-4 (87 ± 4.8%), a lymphoblastoid cell line and MDCK (91.25 ± 0.01%), a cell line expressing surface 9-OAcSA, confirms the preferential binding of ATN(H) to lymphoblasts through their surface 9-OAcSGs. Furthermore, fluorometric quantitation reveals a 4.6-fold increase in % of 9-OAcSA on lymphoblasts of ALL patients (42.1 ± 4.1%) compared to normal donors (9.2. ± 3.4%). Western blotting confirms that ATN(H) recognizes two membrane sialoglycoconjugates, of MW 120 kDa and 90 kDa, both having 9-OAcSA α2 → 6 GalNAc terminal sugar moiety as their lectinogenic epitope. We propose that these 9-OAcSGs may serve as biomarkers for detection and monitoring of lymphoblasts in ALL and accordingly merit therapeutic considerations.

Epidemiology and horizontal transmission of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2).

Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is a small, non-enveloped, circular, single-stranded DNA virus of economic importance in the swine industry worldwide. Based on the sequence analyses of PCV2 strains, isolates can be divided into five subtypes (PCV2a-e). PCV2 is an ubiquitous virus based on serological and viremia data from countries worldwide. In addition, PCV2 DNA was discovered in archived samples prior to the first recognition of clinical disease. Recently, a worldwide shift in PCV2 subtype from PCV2a to PCV2b occurred. PCV2 DNA can be detected in fecal, nasal, oral and tonsillar swabs as well as in urine and feces from both naturally and experimentally infected pigs. PCV2 DNA can be detected early in the infectious process and persists for extended periods of time. The effectiveness of disinfectants for reducing PCV2 in vitro is variable and PCV2 is very stable in the pig environment. Limited data exist on the horizontal transmission of PCV2. Direct transmission of PCV2 between experimentally or naturally infected animals and naïve animals has been documented and the incorporation of clinical or subclinically infected animals into a population represents a risk to the herd. Indirect transmission through the oral, aerosol or vaccine routes is likely a lesser risk for the transmission of PCV2 in most swine populations but may be worth evaluating in high heath herds. The objective of this review was to discuss data on the epidemiology and horizontal transmission of PCV2.

What We Are Watching—Top Global Infectious Disease Threats, 2013-2016: An Update from CDC's Global Disease Detection Operations Center

To better track public health events in areas where the public health system is unable or unwilling to report the event to appropriate public health authorities, agencies can conduct event-based surveillance, which is defined as the organized collection, monitoring, assessment, and interpretation of unstructured information regarding public health events that may represent an acute risk to public health. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Global Disease Detection Operations Center (GDDOC) was created in 2007 to serve as CDC's platform dedicated to conducting worldwide event-based surveillance, which is now highlighted as part of the “detect” element of the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA). The GHSA works toward making the world more safe and secure from disease threats through building capacity to better “Prevent, Detect, and Respond” to those threats. The GDDOC monitors approximately 30 to 40 public health events each day. In this article, we describe the top threats to public health monitored during 2012 to 2016: avian influenza, cholera, Ebola virus disease, and the vector-borne diseases yellow fever, chikungunya virus, and Zika virus, with updates to the previously described threats from Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and poliomyelitis.

Collaborative Intervention of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: Rapid Response Team

On May 20th 2015, a 68 year old man was the first to be diagnosed with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) in Korea. He travelled to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar for 16 days. On May 4th 2015, the patient entered Korea, with febrile sense and respiratory symptoms that appeared on May 11th. The MERS-CoV Outbreak became worse and several patients had to be admitted throughout various hospitals starting at the beginning of June. This situation led to a nationwide chaos. The Rapid Response Team (RRT) was organized after the Korean government's calling for specialists that were composed of 15 Infectious disease Doctors and 2 Infection Control professionals on the 8th of June 2015. The main purpose of the RRT were: 1) consultation to the Government controlling MERS-CoV outbreak. 2) Visit hospitals that were exposed to MERS-CoV infected patients, and to provide advice regarding infection control strategy for rehabilitating of the exposed hospitals. Since June 8th, the RRT visited more than 10 hospitals and an effective consultation was carried out. Most of the hospitals were recovering from the MERS outbreak since early July. Cooperation between the government and private sector experts was very effective. The efforts of government and private sector experts overcame the initial chaos situation. It could prevent further deterioration of the MERS outbreak.

Testing devices for the prevention and treatment of stroke and its complications.

We are entering a challenging but exciting period when many new interventions may appear for stroke based on the use of devices. Hopefully these will lead to improved outcomes at a cost that can be afforded in most parts of the world. Nevertheless, it is vital that lessons are learnt from failures in the development of pharmacological interventions (and from some early device studies), including inadequate preclinical testing, suboptimal trial design and analysis, and underpowered studies. The device industry is far more disparate than that seen for pharmaceuticals; companies are very variable in size and experience in stroke, and are developing interventions across a wide range of stroke treatment and prevention. It is vital that companies work together where sales and marketing are not involved, including in understanding basic stroke mechanisms, prospective systematic reviews, and education of physicians. Where possible, industry and academics should also work closely together to ensure trials are designed to be relevant to patient care and outcomes. Additionally, regulation of the device industry lags behind that for pharmaceuticals, and it is critical that new interventions are shown to be safe and effective rather than just feasible. Phase IV postmarketing surveillance studies will also be needed to ensure that devices are safe when used in the 'real-world' and to pick up uncommon adverse events.

Covid-19, Mental Health and Psychological First Aid

Crises such as the global pandemic of Covid-19 (coronavirus) elicit a range of responses from individuals and societies adversely affecting physical and emotional well-being. This article provides an overview of factors elicited in response to Covid-19 and their impact on immunity, physical health, mental health and wellbeing. Certain groups, such as individuals with mental illness, are especially vulnerable, so it is important to maximise the supports available to this population and their families during the pandemic. More broadly, the World Health Organization recommends "Psychological First Aid" as a useful technique that can help many people in a time of crisis.

Purification and characterization of HIV–human protein complexes

Abstract To fully understand how pathogens infect their host and hijack key biological processes, systematic mapping of intra-pathogenic and pathogen–host protein–protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial. Due to the relatively small size of viral genomes (usually around 10–100 proteins), generation of comprehensive host–virus PPI maps using different experimental platforms, including affinity tag purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) approaches, can be achieved. Global maps such as these provide unbiased insight into the molecular mechanisms of viral entry, replication and assembly. However, to date, only two-hybrid methodology has been used in a systematic fashion to characterize viral–host protein–protein interactions, although a deluge of data exists in databases that manually curate from the literature individual host–pathogen PPIs. We will summarize this work and also describe an AP-MS platform that can be used to characterize viral-human protein complexes and discuss its application for the HIV genome.

Human mastadenovirus-B (HAdV-B)-specific E3-CR1β and E3-CR1γ glycoproteins interact with each other and localize at the plasma membrane of non-polarized airway epithelial cells

Abstract The E3 region of all simian and human types classified within species Human mastadenovirus B (HAdV-B) encodes two unique highly conserved ORFs of unknown function designated E3-CR1β and E3-CR1γ. We generated a HAdV-3 mutant encoding small epitope tags at the N-termini of both E3-CR1β and E3-CR1γ (HAdV-3 N-tag wt) and a double knock out (HAdV-3 N-tag DKO) mutant virus that does not express either protein. Our studies show that HAdV-3 E3-CR1β and E3-CR1γ are type I transmembrane proteins that are produced predominantly at late times post infection, are glycosylated, co-localize at the plasma membrane of non-polarized epithelial cells, and interact with each other. At their extreme C-termini HAdV-B E3-CR1β and E3-CR1γ possess a conserved di-leucine motif followed by a class II PDZ domain binding motif (PBM). HAdV-3 E3-CR1β and E3-CR1γ are dispensable for virus growth, progeny release, spread, and plaque formation in A549 cells.

An Effective Platform for Exploring Rotavirus Receptors by Bacterial Surface Display System

Rotavirus (RV) is a major foodborne pathogen. For RV prevention and control, it is a key to uncover the interaction mechanism between virus and its receptors. However, it is hard to specially purify the viral receptors, including histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). Previously, the protruding domain protein (P protein) of human norovirus (genotype II.4) was displayed on the surface of Escherichia coli, and it specifically recognized and captured the viral ligands. In order to further verify the feasibility of the system, P protein was replaced by VP8* of RV (G9P[8]) in this study. In the system, VP8* could be correctly released by thrombin treatment with antigenicity retaining, which was confirmed by Western blot and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays. Type A HBGAs from porcine gastric mucin (PGM) were recognized and captured by this system. From saliva mixture, the captured viral receptor bound with displayed VP8* was confirmed positive with monoclonal antibody against type A HBGAs. It indicated that the target ligands could be easily separated from the complex matrix. These results demonstrate that the bacterial surface display system will be an effective platform to explore viral receptors/ligands from cell lines or food matrix.

Advice on Standardized Diagnosis and Treatment for Spinal Diseases during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in December 2019 that caused difficulties for clinical work. Practical work experience in our spinal outpatient and emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic is summarized in this article, with combined evidence-based medical evidence to explore a standardized process of diagnosis and treatment for spinal diseases. Outpatient reservation, continuous screening, triage, and isolation, first consultation accountability system, pandemic reporting system, and online revisit were strictly followed. We hope that our experience in prevention and control of COVID-19 can help spine surgeons globally in stopping the spread of COVID-19. Spine surgeons should collaborate with infection control specialists to avoid cross-infection in hospitals and optimize treatment.

COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 16 (Reporting week to 23:59 AEST 17 May 2020).

Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 17 May 2020: notifications = 7,075; deaths = 100. The incidence of new cases of COVID-19 has reduced dramatically since a peak in mid-March. Social distancing measures, public health action and the reduction in international travel have likely been effective in slowing the spread of the disease, in the Australian community. Testing rates over the past week have increased markedly, with a continued very low proportion of people testing positive. These low rates of detection are indicative of low levels of COVID-19 transmission. It is important that testing rates and community adherence to public health measures remain high to support the continued suppression of the virus, particularly in vulnerable high-risk groups and settings. New cases of COVID-19 are currently being reported by by only some jurisdictions, albeit at relatively low rates. Although case numbers are low, new cases tend to still be a mix of overseas-acquired and locally-acquired infections. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a known case or cluster. Although the proportion of locally-acquired cases has increased, the overall rate of new cases, regardless of place of acquisition, continues to decrease. The crude case fatality rate in Australia remains low (1.4%), compared with the WHO reported global rate (6.9%). The low case fatality rate is likely reflective of high case detection and high quality of health care services in Australia. Deaths from COVID-19 in Australia have occurred predominantly among the elderly and those with comorbidities, with no deaths occurring in those under 40 years. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 60-79 years. One third of all cases in this age group have been associated with several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in young children, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, while the number of new cases each day remains relatively stable at the global level, some areas such as Brazil and India are showing a dramatic rise in reported cases. Although some low-income countries have so far reported few cases, it is possible that this is due to limited diagnostic and public health capacity, and may not be reflective of true disease incidence.

Effect of heliox on end-tidal CO2 measurement in healthy adults.

BACKGROUND Therapeutic gases and other modalities delivered by inhalation may affect the accuracy of capnographic measurements in 2 ways. First is the specificity of the measurement of CO2 within the device, and second is the dilution effect of supplemental gases in the ambient air during CO2 sampling by the device. Our goal was to determine if variables such as inhaled gas composition, gas flows delivered via non-rebreather mask, and mouth open or closed affect measurements of end-tidal CO2 pressure (PETCO2) measured with the Capnostream 20 capnograph. METHODS We measured PETCO2 and breathing frequency by capnography in 20 adult normal subjects, with coaching to maintain respiratory frequency between 10 and 20 breaths/min. SpO2 was monitored to detect hypoxemia. A 6 min wash-out period occurred between each 6 min level of testing. RESULTS A mixed models analysis revealed that the mean ± SD PETCO2 for all subjects and flows while breathing heliox (37 ± 5 mm Hg) was not different (P = .50) from the value while breathing room air (36 ± 5 mm Hg). Repeated measurements with given subjects over 6 min periods of breathing spontaneously 0 L/min, with 10 L/min, and with 15 L/min of either air or heliox showed no difference in PETCO2 related to flow: P = .97 for 0 L/min vs 10 L/min, P = .87 for 0 L/min vs. 15 L/min. CONCLUSIONS In normal subjects, PETCO2 measurements with the Capnostream 20 were not affected by heliox or gas flow at 10 or 15 L/min through a non-rebreathing mask.

Semi-prone video-assisted thoracoscopy for the treatment of large infracarinal traction diverticula.

BACKGROUND Large middle-third esophageal diverticula are rare. Thoracotomy has been proposed as mainstay of treatment; however, minimally invasive resection through lateral or prone position thoracoscopy has been described. METHODS The technical aspects of the novel semi-prone minimally invasive thoracoscopy (spVATS) in the management of large (> 5 cm) infracarinal traction diverticula are described. Operative outcomes, pre- and postoperative symptoms (Eckardt score) and quality of life (Short-Form 36) are analyzed. RESULTS Four symptomatic patients underwent spVATS for traction midesophageal diverticula. The median age was 59 years and 75% were males. The median diverticulum size was 7.0 cm (range 5.5-8). The median preoperative Eckardt score was 8.4 (range 5-10), and the overall incidence of respiratory symptoms was 50%. Esophageal manometry was performed in three patients with no evidence of underlying motility disorders. The median operative time was 149 min (range 125-175). No intraoperative complications or open conversions occurred. Postoperative morbidity and mortality were 25% and 0%, respectively. The median hospital length of stay was 7.5 days (range 6-10). The median postoperative follow-up was 22 months (range 5-35). At the last follow-up, there was a significant improvement of patients' symptoms (p = 0.024) and quality of life (p < 0.05) with complete resolution of respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION In summary, spVATS seems a valuable approach to treat large midesophageal traction diverticula in centers experienced with minimally invasive esophageal surgery. Further studies are needed to validate the advantages and promising outcomes of the spVATS providing more robust evidence on the treatment of this rare clinical entity.

Determining the Replication Kinetics and Cellular Tropism of Influenza D Virus on Primary Well-Differentiated Human Airway Epithelial Cells

Influenza viruses are notorious pathogens that frequently cross the species barrier with often severe consequences for both animal and human health. In 2011, a novel member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, Influenza D virus (IDV), was identified in the respiratory tract of swine. Epidemiological surveys revealed that IDV is distributed worldwide among livestock and that IDV-directed antibodies are detected in humans with occupational exposure to livestock. To identify the transmission capability of IDV to humans, we determined the viral replication kinetics and cell tropism using an in vitro respiratory epithelium model of humans. The inoculation of IDV revealed efficient replication kinetics and apical progeny virus release at different body temperatures. Intriguingly, the replication characteristics of IDV revealed higher replication kinetics compared to Influenza C virus, despite sharing the cell tropism preference for ciliated cells. Collectively, these results might indicate why IDV-directed antibodies are detected among humans with occupational exposure to livestock.

Rapid viral diagnosis for acute febrile respiratory illness in children in the Emergency Department.

BACKGROUND Pediatric acute respiratory infections (ARIs) represent a significant burden on pediatric Emergency Departments (EDs) and families. Most of these illnesses are due to viruses. However, investigations (radiography, blood, and urine testing) to rule out bacterial infections and antibiotics are often ordered because of diagnostic uncertainties. This results in prolonged ED visits and unnecessary antibiotic use. The risk of concurrent bacterial infection has been reported to be negligible in children over three months of age with a confirmed viral infection. Rapid viral testing in the ED may alleviate the need for precautionary testing and antibiotic use. OBJECTIVES To determine the effect of rapid viral testing in the ED on the rate of precautionary testing, antibiotic use, and length of ED visit. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4); EMBASE (1988 to December 2011); MEDLINE Ovid (1950 to November week 4, 2011); MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (8 December 2011); HealthStar (1966 to 2009); BIOSIS Previews (1969 to December 2011); CAB Abstracts (1973 to December 2011); CBCA Reference (1970 to 2007); and Proquest Dissertations and Theses (1861 to 2009). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of rapid viral testing for children with ARIs in the ED. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors used the inclusion criteria to select trials, evaluate their quality and extract data. We obtained missing data from trial authors. We expressed differences in rate of investigations and antibiotic use as risk ratios (RRs), and expressed difference in ED length of visits as mean differences (MDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS We included four trials (three RCTs and one quazi-RCT), with 759 children in the rapid viral testing group and 829 in the control group. Three out of the four studies were comparable in terms of young age of participants, with one study increasing the age of inclusion up to five years of age. All studies included either fever or respiratory symptoms as inclusion criteria (two required both, one required fever or respiratory symptoms, and one required only fever). All studies were comparable in terms of exclusion criteria, intervention, and outcome data. In terms of risk of bias, one study failed to utilize a random sequence generator, one study did not comment on completeness of outcome data, and only one of four studies included allocation concealment as part of the study design. None of the studies definitively blinded participants.Rapid viral testing did not reduce antibiotic use in the ED significantly, neither clinically nor statistically. We found lower rates of chest radiography (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.91) in the rapid viral testing group, but no effect on length of ED visits, or blood or urine testing in the ED. No study made mention of any adverse effects related to viral testing. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Current evidence is insufficient to support routine rapid viral testing as a means to reduce antibiotic use in pediatric EDs. Results suggest that rapid viral testing may be beneficial in terms of reducing rates of antibiotic usage, urine investigations and blood investigations, but are not statistically significant due to lack of power. Rapid viral testing does reduce the rate of chest X-rays in the ED. A large trial addressing the effect on antibiotic usage is needed.

Isoprinosine: Lack of Antiviral Activity in Experimental Model Infections

This report is a condensation of data from a collaborative study proposed and sponsored by the Antiviral Substances Program of NIAID. The individual reports were prepared by the following persons: S. Baron and M. Worthington, NIAID, NIH; A. Friedman-Kien, New York University College of Medicine; J. C. Duenwald, Washington State University, L. A. Glasgow, M. Harmon, B. Janis, E. Kern, J. C. Overall, Jr., C. B. Smith, D. A. Stringfellow, and S. Westerberg, University of Utah College of Medicine; B. C. Easterday and E. H. Weinberg, University of Wisconsin.* Recently there has been much interest in isoprinosine as a broad-spectrum antiviral compound. The activity of this substance was evaluated in a coordinated study at five institutions. Experimental models in five species of animals were established using 11 viruses. Criteria for selection were: (l) representation of most major groups of viruses, (2) reproduction of natural routes of infection, and (3) simulation of potentially treatable viral infections of man. No therapeutic effect could be demonstrated in infections with encephalomyocarditis virus, type 2 Herpesvirus hominis, influenza, and rabies viruses in mice; vaccinia virus in rabbits; rhinotracheitis and panleukopenia viruses in cats; distemper virus in ferrets; and influenza and transmissible gastroenteritis viruses in swine. The only antiviral activity observed in this extensive series of experiments was suppression of fibroma virus lesions in rabbits given 600 mg/ kg per day of isoprinosine. Although antiviral activity is not precluded in other viral infections in animals or in man, these results clearly fail to substantiate the potential of isoprinosine as a potent, broad-spectrum antiviral substance.

The threat and prospects for control of an influenza pandemic.

Influenza constitutes the most widespread and significant respiratory infectious disease in the world, resulting in increased morbidity, mortality and economic loss each epidemic year. Pandemic influenza is a worldwide epidemic usually caused by a new virus variant to which the majority of the population has no immunity. As demonstrated in the devastating pandemic of 1918 to 1919, a pandemic virus may infect 30 to 50% of the worlds population and kill 1 to 2% of those infected. Pandemic control must be a concerted and co-ordinated world strategy and under the auspices of the World Health Organization, pandemic preparedness plans have been formulated, including: intensified surveillance for more rapid identification of new reassortant viruses with potential human virulence and infectivity, laboratory characterization of the new viruses so that vaccine may be prepared, development of techniques for more rapid vaccine production and the manufacture and stock piling of antiviral drugs. The H5N1 outbreak of virulent chicken influenza in 1997 in Hong Kong which resulted in the deaths of six of 18 infected persons serves as a wake-up call. Should such a virus attain high transmissibility in humans, a pandemic of tragic proportions might ensue. Even though the timing of onset of the next pandemic cannot be precisely predicted, world governments must understand the urgency of the problem and increase funding for influenza pandemic control.

Stabilization of a steerable sheath during retrograde access to antegrade-oriented branches in complex endovascular aortic aneurysm repair.

During branched endovascular aneurysm repair, cannulation of the visceral target vessels through antegrade branches and insertion of bridging stents are frequently done from an upper extremity access. A retrograde femoral approach is a challenging alternative when an antegrade approach is not preferred. Herein, we describe a technique to increase stability of a steerable sheath, using a single suture, for bridging antegrade-facing branches from a retrograde access. This technique secures the sheath's deflected tip and provides more pushability to the steerable sheath.

Probabilistic Model of Narratives Over Topical Trends in Social Media: A Discrete Time Model

Online social media platforms are turning into the prime source of news and narratives about worldwide events. However,a systematic summarization-based narrative extraction that can facilitate communicating the main underlying events is lacking. To address this issue, we propose a novel event-based narrative summary extraction framework. Our proposed framework is designed as a probabilistic topic model, with categorical time distribution, followed by extractive text summarization. Our topic model identifies topics' recurrence over time with a varying time resolution. This framework not only captures the topic distributions from the data, but also approximates the user activity fluctuations over time. Furthermore, we define significance-dispersity trade-off (SDT) as a comparison measure to identify the topic with the highest lifetime attractiveness in a timestamped corpus. We evaluate our model on a large corpus of Twitter data, including more than one million tweets in the domain of the disinformation campaigns conducted against the White Helmets of Syria. Our results indicate that the proposed framework is effective in identifying topical trends, as well as extracting narrative summaries from text corpus with timestamped data.

Forecasting Covid-19 dynamics in Brazil: a data driven approach

This paper has a twofold contribution. The first is a data driven approach for predicting the Covid-19 pandemic dynamics, based on data from more advanced countries. The second is to report and discuss the results obtained with this approach for Brazilian states, as of May 4th, 2020. We start by presenting preliminary results obtained by training an LSTM-SAE network, which are somewhat disappointing. Then, our main approach consists in an initial clustering of the world regions for which data is available and where the pandemic is at an advanced stage, based on a set of manually engineered features representing a country's response to the early spread of the pandemic. A Modified Auto-Encoder network is then trained from these clusters and learns to predict future data for Brazilian states. These predictions are used to estimate important statistics about the disease, such as peaks. Finally, curve fitting is carried out on the predictions in order to find the distribution that best fits the outputs of the MAE, and to refine the estimates of the peaks of the pandemic. Results indicate that the pandemic is still growing in Brazil, with most states peaks of infection estimated between the 25th of April and the 19th of May 2020. Predicted numbers reach a total of 240 thousand infected Brazilians, distributed among the different states, with Sao Paulo leading with almost 65 thousand estimated, confirmed cases. The estimated end of the pandemics (with 97 % of cases reaching an outcome) starts as of May 28th for some states and rests through August 14th, 2020.

COVID-19 and associations with frailty and multimorbidity: a prospective analysis of UK Biobank participants

Background Frailty and multimorbidity have been suggested as risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. Aims We investigated whether frailty and multimorbidity were associated with risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 in the UK Biobank. Methods 502,640 participants aged 40-69 years at baseline (54-79 years at COVID-19 testing) were recruited across UK 2006-10. A modified assessment of frailty using Fried's classification was generated from baseline data. COVID-19 test results (England) were available 16/03/2020-01/06/2020, mostly taken in hospital settings. Logistic regression was used to discern associations between frailty, multimorbidity and COVID-19 diagnoses, adjusting for sex, age, BMI, ethnicity, education, smoking and number of comorbidity groupings, comparing COVID-19 positive, COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. Results 4,510 participants were tested for COVID-19 (positive=1,326, negative=3,184). 497,996 participants were not tested. Compared to the non-tested group, after adjustment, COVID-19 positive participants were more likely to be frail (OR=1.3 [95% CI=1.1, 1.7]), report slow walking speed (OR=1.3 [1.1, 1.6]), report two or more falls in the past year (OR=1.3 [1.0, 1.5]) and be multimorbid ([≥]4 comorbidity groupings vs 0-1: OR=1.9 [1.5, 2.3]). However, similar strength of associations were apparent when comparing COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. Furthermore, frailty and multimorbidity were not associated with COVID-19 diagnoses, when comparing COIVD-19 positive and COVID-19 negative participants. Discussion and conclusions Frailty and multimorbidity do not appear to aid risk stratification, in terms of a positive versus negative results of COVID-19 testing. Investigation of the prognostic value of these markers for adverse clinical sequelae following COVID-19 disease is urgently needed.

Worldwide differences in COVID-19-related mortality

Mortality statistics due to COVID-19 worldwide are compared, by adjusting for the size of the population and the stage of the pandemic. Data from the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, and Our World in Data websites were used. Analyses are based on number of deaths per one million inhabitants. In order to account for the stage of the pandemic, the baseline date was defined as the day in which the 10th death was reported. The analyses included 78 countries and territories which reported 10 or more deaths by April 9. On day 10, India had 0.06 deaths per million, Belgium had 30.46 and San Marino 618.78. On day 20, India had 0.27 deaths per million, China had 0.71 and Spain 139.62. On day 30, four Asian countries had the lowest mortality figures, whereas eight European countries had the highest ones. In Italy and Spain, mortality on day 40 was greater than 250 per million, whereas in China and South Korea, mortality was below 4 per million. Mortality on day 10 was moderately correlated with life expectancy, but not with population density. Asian countries presented much lower mortality figures as compared to European ones. Life expectancy was found to be correlated with mortality.

Identification of a peptide derived from the heptad repeat 2 region of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) spike glycoprotein that is capable of suppressing PEDV entry and inducing neutralizing antibodies

Abstract Heptad repeat (HR) regions are highly conserved motifs located in the glycoproteins of enveloped viruses that form a six-helix bundle structure and is important in the process of virus fusion. Peptides derived from the HR regions of some viruses have also been shown to inhibit viral entry. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was predicted to have HR regions (HR1 and HR2) in the spike glycoprotein S2 subunit. Based on this analysis, six peptides derived from HR1 and HR2 were selected, expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. Three peptides (HR2M, HR2L and HR2P) were identified as potential competitive inhibitors in PEDV in vitro infection assays, with the HR2P peptide representing the most potent inhibitor. Further study indicated that immunization of HR2P in mice elicited antibodies capable of neutralizing PEDV infection in vitro. These results demonstrate that the HR2P peptide and anti-HR2P antibody can serve as a tool for dissecting the fusion mechanism of PEDV, guiding the search for potent inhibitors with therapeutic value against PEDV infection.

Epidemiological characteristics of the first 100 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, a city with a stringent containment policy

BACKGROUND: Hong Kong (HK) is a densely populated city near the epicentre of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Stringent border control together with aggressive case finding, contact tracing, social distancing and quarantine measures were implemented to halt the importation and spread of the virus. METHODS: We performed an epidemiological study using government information covering the first 100 confirmed cases to examine the epidemic curve, incidence, clusters, reproduction number (Rt), incubation period and time to containment. RESULTS: A total of 93 of the 100 cases were HK residents (6 infected in Mainland China, 10 on the Diamond Princess Cruise). Seven were visitors infected in Mainland China before entering HK. The majority (76%) were aged &#8805;45 years, and the incidence increased with age (P < 0.001). Escalation of border control measures correlated with a decrease in the proportion (62.5% to 0%) of cases imported from Mainland China, and a reduction in Rt (1.07 to 0.75). The median incubation period was 4.2 days [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.0-4.5; 5th and 95th percentiles: 1.3 and 14.0). Most clusters with identifiable epidemiological links were households involving 2-4 people. Three medium-spreading events were identified: two from New Year gatherings (6-11 people), and another from environmental contamination of a worship hall (12 people). Despite intensified contact tracing, containment was delayed in 78.9% of cases (mean = 5.96 days, range = 0-24 days). An unusual transmission in a multi-storey building via faulty toilet plumbing was suspected with >100 residents evacuated overnight. Our analysis indicated that faulty plumbing was unlikely to be the source of this transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Timely stringent containment policies minimized the importation and transmission of COVID-19 in HK.

Potential drug-drug interactions associated with drugs currently proposed for COVID-19 treatment in patients receiving other treatments

Patients with COVID-19 are sometimes already being treated for one or more other chronic conditions, especially if they are elderly. Introducing a treatment against COVID-19, either on an outpatient basis or during hospitalization for more severe cases, raises the question of potential drug-drug interactions. Here, we analyzed the potential or proven risk of the co-administration of drugs used for the most common chronic diseases and those currently offered as treatment or undergoing therapeutic trials for COVID-19. Practical recommendations are offered, where possible.

Natural Killer Cells Promote Early CD8 T Cell Responses against Cytomegalovirus

Understanding the mechanisms that help promote protective immune responses to pathogens is a major challenge in biomedical research and an important goal for the design of innovative therapeutic or vaccination strategies. While natural killer (NK) cells can directly contribute to the control of viral replication, whether, and how, they may help orchestrate global antiviral defense is largely unknown. To address this question, we took advantage of the well-defined molecular interactions involved in the recognition of mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) by NK cells. By using congenic or mutant mice and wild-type versus genetically engineered viruses, we examined the consequences on antiviral CD8 T cell responses of specific defects in the ability of the NK cells to control MCMV. This system allowed us to demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, that NK cells accelerate CD8 T cell responses against a viral infection in vivo. Moreover, we identify the underlying mechanism as the ability of NK cells to limit IFN-α/β production to levels not immunosuppressive to the host. This is achieved through the early control of cytomegalovirus, which dramatically reduces the activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) for cytokine production, preserves the conventional dendritic cell (cDC) compartment, and accelerates antiviral CD8 T cell responses. Conversely, exogenous IFN-α administration in resistant animals ablates cDCs and delays CD8 T cell activation in the face of NK cell control of viral replication. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the ability of NK cells to respond very early to cytomegalovirus infection critically contributes to balance the intensity of other innate immune responses, which dampens early immunopathology and promotes optimal initiation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses. Thus, the extent to which NK cell responses benefit the host goes beyond their direct antiviral effects and extends to the prevention of innate cytokine shock and to the promotion of adaptive immunity.

Perineural hematoma may result in nerve inflammation and myelin damage.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Perineural hematoma may occur during performance of peripheral nerve blocks. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that an iatrogenic hematoma in the immediate vicinity of a peripheral nerve may cause histologic evidence of nerve injury. METHODS Fifty milliliters of autologous blood was injected adjacent to the right sciatic nerve in 20 anesthetized female pigs. In order to discern between blood-related volume and immune effects, 50 mL of albumin was injected at the same location in an additional 22 pigs. Either blood or albumin was injected in random order. The left sciatic nerve served as a negative control in all animals, that is, either no needle placement or needle placement without injection. After 48 hours, the nerves were resected. The grade of nerve injury was scored from 0 (no injury) to 3 (severe injury) by histologic analysis of myelin tissue and inflammatory cells. RESULTS Eighty-two nerve specimens were examined. Injury scores were significantly (P < 0.01) higher in the blood injection (n = 20; median [interquartile range] 2 [2-2]) and albumin injection (n = 22, 1 [1-2]) conditions compared with the no needle placement (n = 22, 0 [0-1]) and "dry needle placement" (n = 20, 1 [0-1]) conditions. Widespread inflammatory changes were seen in the blood injection group, in which 15% of nerve specimens showed damage to myelin. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that hematoma adjacent to nerve tissue may result in structural nerve injury and inflammatory changes.

Comparison of two methods to clear the airways of critically ill children and adults with COVID-19 infection: a structured summary of a study protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial

OBJECTIVES: As there is no treatment for COVID-19 with a proven mortality benefit at this moment in the pandemic, supportive management including mechanical ventilation is the core management in an intensive care unit (ICU). It is a challenge to provide consistent care in this situation, highly demanding and leading to potential staff shortages in ICU. We need to reduce unnecessary exposure of healthcare workers to the virus. This study aims to examine the impact of care using a non-invasive oscillating device (NIOD) for chest physiotherapy in the care of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. In particular, we aim to explore if a NIOD performed by non-specialized personnel is not inferior to the standard chest physiotherapy (CPT) undertaken by physiotherapists caring for patients with COVID-19. TRIAL DESIGN: A pilot multicenter prospective crossover noninferiority randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: All mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 admitted to one of the two ICUs, and CPT ordered by the responsible physician. The participants will be recruited from two intensive care units in Canadian Academic Hospitals (one pediatric and one adult ICU). INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: We will implement NIOD and CPT alternatingly for 3 h apart over 3 h. We will apply a pragmatic design, so that other procedures including hypertonic saline nebulization, intermittent positive pressure ventilation, suctioning (e.g., oral or nasal), or changing the ventilator settings or modality (i.e., increasing positive end-expiratory pressure or changing the nasal mask to total face continuous positive airway pressure) can be provided at the direction of bedside intensivists in charge. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome measurement is the oxygenation level before and after the procedure (SpO(2)/FiO(2) ratio). For cases with invasive ventilation (i.e., the use of an endotracheal tube to deliver positive pressure) and non-invasive ventilation, we will also document expiratory tidal volume, vital signs, and any related complications such as vomiting, hypoxemia, or unexpected extubation. We will collect the data before, 10 min after, and 30 min after the procedure. RANDOMIZATION: The order of the procedures (i.e., NIOD or CPT) will be randomly allocated using manual generated random numbers for each case. Randomization will be carried out by the independent research assistant in the study coordinating center by using opaque sealed envelopes, assigning an equal number of cases to each intervention arm. Stratification will be applied for age (> 18 years or ≤ 18 years of age) and the study sites. BLINDING (MASKING): No blinding will be performed. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): We estimate the necessary sample size as 25 for each arm (total 50 cases), with a power of 0.90 and an alpha of 0.05, with a non-inferiority design. TRIAL STATUS: The protocol version number 1 was approved on 27 March 2020. Currently, recruitment has not yet started, with the start scheduled by the mid-June 2020 and the end anticipated by December 2020. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04361435. Registered on 28 April 2020 FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional File 1). In the interest in expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol.

Characterize health and economic vulnerabilities of workers to control the emergence of COVID-19 in an industrial zone in Vietnam

The detection of first COVID-19 infected industrial worker in Vietnam on 13 April 2020 prompted timely effort to examine the health problems, behaviors, and health services access of industrial workers to inform effective and appropriate COVID-19 control measures, minimizing the risk of industrial sites becoming the next disease cluster. A search strategy involving search terms corresponding to 'health', 'industrial worker', and 'Vietnam' was applied to search for related papers published in English on Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Duplicates were removed, and relevant data were extracted from the full text of remaining publications. Results showed that underlying health problems, including respiratory system problems, were common among industrial workers. Many suffered occupational diseases and/or work-related injuries. Self-treatment (without medication) was the most used method when having health problems (by 28.2% to 51% of participants), followed by visiting commune health centers (24%) and self-medication (20.3%). Findings suggest a high risk of disease spreading among industrial workers and of them suffering more severe conditions when infected. Economic vulnerabilities may be the reason for workers' reluctance to taking time off work to attend hospital/clinic. These imply a need for involving local pharmacies, commune health centers, traditional health providers or village health collaborators as local health gatekeepers who are the first point of detecting and reporting of suspected COVID-19 cases, as well as a channel where accurate information regarding COVID-19, protective equipment, and intervention packages can be delivered. Having COVID-19 testing centers at or near industrial sites are also recommended.

Assessing activity and inhibition of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus papain-like and 3C-like proteases using luciferase-based biosensors.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is associated with an outbreak of more than 90 cases of severe pneumonia with high mortality (greater than 50%). To date, there are no antiviral drugs or specific therapies to treat MERS-CoV. To rapidly identify potential inhibitors of MERS-CoV replication, we expressed the papain-like protease (PLpro) and the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) from MERS-CoV and developed luciferase-based biosensors to monitor protease activity in cells. We show that the expressed MERS-CoV PLpro recognizes and processes the canonical CoV-PLpro cleavage site RLKGG in the biosensor. However, existing CoV PLpro inhibitors were unable to block MERS-CoV PLpro activity, likely due to the divergence of the amino acid sequence in the drug binding site. To investigate MERS-CoV 3CLpro activity, we expressed the protease in context with flanking nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4) and the amino-terminal portion of nsp6 and detected processing of the luciferase-based biosensors containing the canonical 3CLpro cleavage site VRLQS. Importantly, we found that a small-molecule inhibitor that blocks replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV and murine CoV also inhibits the activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. Overall, the protease expression and biosensor assays developed here allow for rapid evaluation of viral protease activity and the identification of protease inhibitors. These biosensor assays can now be used to screen for MERS-CoV-specific or broad-spectrum coronavirus PLpro and 3CLpro inhibitors.

Efficient sample pooling strategies for COVID-19 data gathering

Sample pooling of CoViD-19 PCR tests has been recently proposed as a low cost alternative to individual tests. We show that sample pooling is efficient as long as the fraction of the population infected is relatively small. Fisher information theory suggests a rule of thumb that for low infection rates p, pooling 2/p samples is close to optimal. We present a simple strategy for survey design when not even a ballpark estimate of the infection rate is available.

Application of Molecular Beacons in Real-Time PCR

Real-time PCR or quantitative PCR (QPCR) is a powerful technique that allows measurement of PCR product while the amplification reaction proceeds. It incorporates the fluorescent element into conventional PCR as the calculation standard to provide a quantitative result. In this sense, fluorescent chemistry is the key component in QPCR. Till now, two types of fluorescent chemistries have been adopted in the QPCR systems: one is nonspecific probe and the other is specific. As a brilliant invention by Kramer et al. in 1996, molecular beacon is naturally suited as the reporting element in real-time PCR and has been adapted for many molecular biology applications. In this chapter, we briefly introduce the working principle of QPCR and overview different fluorescent chemistries, and then we focus on the applications of molecular beacons-like gene expression study, single-nucleotide polymorphisms and mutation detection, and pathogenic detection.

Screening and druggability analysis of some plant metabolites against SARS-CoV-2: An integrative computational approach

The sudden outbreak of novel coronavirus has caused a global concern due to its infection rate and mortality. Despite extensive research, there are still no specific drugs or vaccines to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence, this study was designed to evaluate some plant-based active compounds for drug candidacy against SARS-CoV-2 by using virtual screening methods and various computational analyses. A total of 27 plant metabolites were screened against SARS-CoV-2 main protease proteins (MPP), Nsp9 RNA binding protein, spike receptor binding domain, spike ecto-domain and HR2 domain using a molecular docking approach. Four metabolites, i.e., asiatic acid, avicularin, guajaverin, and withaferin showed maximum binding affinity with all key proteins in terms of lowest global binding energy. The crucial binding sites and drug surface hotspots were unravelled for each viral protein. The top candidates were further employed for ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) analysis to investigate their drug profiles. Results suggest that none of the compounds render any undesirable consequences that could reduce their drug likeness properties. The analysis of toxicity pattern revealed no significant tumorigenic, mutagenic, irritating, or reproductive effects by the compounds. However, withaferin was comparatively toxic among the top four candidates with considerable cytotoxicity and immunotoxicity. Most of the target class by top drug candidates belonged to enzyme groups (e.g. oxidoreductases hydrolases, phosphatases). Moreover, results of drug similarity prediction revealed two approved structural analogs of Asiatic acid i.e. Hydrocortisone (DB00741) (previously used for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS) and Dinoprost-tromethamine (DB01160) from DrugBank. In addition, two other biologically active compounds, Mupirocin (DB00410) and Simvastatin (DB00641) could be an option for the treatment of viral infections. The study may pave the way to develop effective medications and preventive measure against SARS-CoV-2. Due to the encouraging results, we highly recommend further in vivo trials for the experimental validation of our findings.

The Pivotal Roles of US3 Protein in Cell-to-Cell Spread and Virion Nuclear Egress of Duck Plague Virus.

The duck plague virus (DPV) US3 protein, a homolog of the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) US3 protein that is reported to be critical for viral replication, has been minimally studied. Therefore, to investigate the function of the DPV US3 protein, we used scarless Red recombination technology based on an infectious bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the DPV Chinese virulent strain (CHv) genome and successfully constructed and rescued a US3-deleted mutant and the corresponding revertant virus (BAC-CHv-ΔUS3 and BAC-CHv-ΔUS3R, respectively). For viral growth characteristics, compared to the parental and revertant viruses, the US3-deleted mutant showed an approximately 100-fold reduction in viral titers but no significant reduction in genome copies, indicating that the US3-deleted mutant exhibited decreased viral replication but not decreased viral DNA generation. In addition, the US3-deleted mutant formed viral plaques that were 33% smaller on average than those formed by the parental and revertant viruses, demonstrating that US3 protein affected the viral cell-to-cell spread of DPV. Finally, the results of electron microscopy showed that the deletion of US3 resulted in a large number of virions accumulating in the nucleus and perinuclear space, thus blocking virion nuclear egress. In this study, we found that the DPV US3 protein played pivotal roles in viral replication by promoting viral cell-to-cell spread and virion nuclear egress, which may provide some references for research on the function of the DPV US3 protein.

The dominance of human coronavirus OC43 and NL63 infections in infants

Abstract Background It is unknown to what extent the human coronaviruses (HCoVs) OC43, HKU1, 229E and NL63 infect healthy children. Frequencies of infections are only known for hospitalized children. Objectives Comparing infection frequencies in children who have mild infections with frequencies in children needing hospital uptake will determine whether infection by one of the four HCoVs leads to more severe disease. In addition, the sequence of seroconversions can reveal whether infection by one HCoV protects from infection by other HCoVs. Study design Two distinct study groups were monitored: healthy children and children hospitalized due to respiratory infection. HCoV natural infection rates in healthy children were obtained by serology in 25 newborns (followed 0–20months). The frequencies of severe HCoVs infection was determined by real time RT-PCR among 1471 hospitalized infants (<2-years old) with acute respiratory tract disease. Results The majority of healthy children seroconverted for HCoV-OC43 (n =19) and HCoV-NL63 (n =17), less for HCoV-HKU1 (n =9) and HCoV-229E (n =5). Notably, HCoV-HKU1 seroconversion was absent after HCoV-OC43 infection. Also HCoV-229E infection was rarely observed after HCoV-NL63 infection (1 out of 5). In the hospital 207 (14%) out of 1471 children were HCoV positive. Again we observed most infection by HCoV-OC43 (n =85) and HCoV-NL63 (n =60), followed by HCoV-HKU1 (n =47) and HCoV-229E (n =15). Conclusions HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 infections occur frequently in early childhood, more often than HCoV-HKU1 or HCoV-229E infections. HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 may elicit immunity that protects from subsequent HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-229E infection, respectively, which would explain why HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 are the most frequently infecting HCoVs. There are no indications that infection by one of the HCoVs is more pathogenic than others.

Adverse reactions to targeted and non-targeted chemotherapeutic drugs with emphasis on hypersensitivity responses and the invasive metastatic switch

More than 100 drugs are used to treat the many different cancers. They can be divided into agents with relatively broad, non-targeted specificity and targeted drugs developed on the basis of a more refined understanding of individual cancers and directed at specific molecular targets on different cancer cells. Individual drugs in both groups have been classified on the basis of their mechanism of action in killing cancer cells. The targeted drugs include proteasome inhibitors, toxic chimeric proteins and signal transduction inhibitors such as tyrosine kinase (non-receptor and receptor), serine/threonine kinase, histone deacetylase and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. Increasingly used targeted vascular (VEGF) and platelet-derived endothelial growth factor blockade can provoke a range of pathological consequences. Many of the non-targeted drugs are cytotoxic, suppressing haematopoiesis as well as provoking cutaneous eruptions and vascular, lung and liver injury. Cytotoxic side effects of the targeted drugs occur less often and usually with less severity, but they show their own unusual adverse effects including, for example, a lengthened QT interval, a characteristic papulopustular rash, nail disorders and a hand–foot skin reaction variant. The term hypersensitivity is widely used across a number of disciplines but not always with the same definition in mind, and the terminology needs to be standardised. This is particularly apparent in cancer chemotherapy where anti-neoplastic drug-induced thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anaemia, vascular disorders, liver injury and lung disease as well as many dermatological manifestations sometimes have an immune basis. The most insidious of all adverse consequences of targeted therapies, however, are tumour adaptation, increased malignancy and the invasive metastatic switch seen with anti-angiogenic drugs that inhibit the VEGF-A pathway. Adverse reactions to 44 non-targeted and 33 targeted, frequently used, chemotherapeutic drugs are presented together with discussions of diagnosis, premedications, desensitizations and importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying the various drug-induced reactions. There is need for wide-ranging acceptance of what constitutes a hypersensitivity reaction and for allergists to be more involved in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of chemotherapeutic drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions.

The effects of metallic implants on electroporation therapies: feasibility of irreversible electroporation for brachytherapy salvage.

PURPOSE Electroporation-based therapies deliver brief electric pulses into a targeted volume to destabilize cellular membranes. Nonthermal irreversible electroporation (IRE) provides focal ablation with effects dependent on the electric field distribution, which changes in heterogeneous environments. It should be determined if highly conductive metallic implants in targeted regions, such as radiotherapy brachytherapy seeds in prostate tissue, will alter treatment outcomes. Theoretical and experimental models determine the impact of prostate brachytherapy seeds on IRE treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study delivered IRE pulses in nonanimal, as well as in ex vivo and in vivo tissue, with and in the absence of expired radiotherapy seeds. Electrical current was measured and lesion dimensions were examined macroscopically and with magnetic resonance imaging. Finite-element treatment simulations predicted the effects of brachytherapy seeds in the targeted region on electrical current, electric field, and temperature distributions. RESULTS There was no significant difference in electrical behavior in tissue containing a grid of expired radiotherapy seeds relative to those without seeds for nonanimal, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments (all p > 0.1). Numerical simulations predict no significant alteration of electric field or thermal effects (all p > 0.1). Histology showed cellular necrosis in the region near the electrodes and seeds within the ablation region; however, there were no seeds beyond the ablation margins. CONCLUSION This study suggests that electroporation therapies can be implemented in regions containing small metallic implants without significant changes to electrical and thermal effects relative to use in tissue without the implants. This supports the ability to use IRE as a salvage therapy option for brachytherapy.

Features of anosmia in COVID-19

Abstract Background: Medical publications about anosmia with COVID-19 are scarce. We aimed to describe the prevalence and features of anosmia in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We retrospectively included COVID-19 patients with anosmia between March 1 and March 17, 2020. We used SARS-CoV-2 real time PCR in respiratory samples to confirm the cases. Results: Fifty-four of 114 patients (47%) with confirmed COVID-19 reported anosmia. Mean age of the 54 patients was 47 (±16) years; 67% were females and 37% were hospitalized. The median Charlson comorbidity index was 0.70 (±1.6 [0-7]). Forty-six patients (85%) had dysgeusia and 28% presented with pneumonia. Anosmia began 4.4 (±1.9 [1-8]) days after infection onset. The mean duration of anosmia was 8.9 (±6.3 [1-21]) days and 98% of patients recovered within 28 days. Conclusions: Anosmia was present in half of our European COVID-19 patients and was often associated with dysgeusia.

A two-patch epidemic model with nonlinear reinfection

The propagation of infectious diseases and its impact on individuals play a major role in disease dynamics, and it is important to incorporate population heterogeneity into efforts to study diseases. As a simplistic but illustrative example, we examine interactions between urban and rural populations in the dynamics of disease spreading. Using a compartmental framework of susceptible--infected--susceptible ($\mathrm{SI\widetilde{S}}$) dynamics with some level of immunity, we formulate a model that allows nonlinear reinfection. We investigate the effects of population movement in the simplest scenario: a case with two patches, which allows us to model movement between urban and rural areas. To study the dynamics of the system, we compute a basic reproduction number for each population (urban and rural). We also compute steady states, determine the local stability of the disease-free steady state, and identify conditions for the existence of endemic steady states. From our analysis and computational experiments, we illustrate that population movement plays an important role in disease dynamics. In some cases, it can be rather beneficial, as it can enlarge the region of stability of a disease-free steady state.

Changes in body weight, physical activity and lifestyle during the semi-lockdown period after the outbreak of COVID-19 in China: an online survey.

Background: The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) provided an opportunity to undertake an online survey to study the relationships between body weight changes with changes in physical activity and lifestyle during an unusual event of forced isolation or quarantine.Methods: We distributed an electronic questionnaire using the popular social application WeChat to adults from any province of China except Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak. The questionnaire asked for demographic information, body weight, physical activity and lifestyle factors before, during the quarantine.Results: Of 376 questionnaires returned, 339 were valid (90.2%). During the period of semi-lockdown, both females and males with BMI < 24 gained weight, while males with BMI ≥ 24 lost weight while females with BMI≥24 gained weight. The average steps per day and the average moderate or vigorous-intensity exercise declined significantly for both males and females during the semi-lockdown. Changes in body weight inversely correlated with changes in steps per day and moderate or vigorous-intensity exercise during the quarantine.Conclusions: Normal weight individuals, who are not normally troubled by overweight or obesity had less awareness of weight gain than people with a BMI≥24. Under the conditions of the semi-lockdown, they tended to gain weight.

Routine upper gastrointestinal imaging is superior to clinical signs for detecting gastrojejunal leak after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

BACKGROUND There are myriad symptoms and signs of gastrojejunal leak; prompt recognition is essential. Many surgeons use clinical predictors to guide selective use of upper gastrointestinal imaging (UGI). The appropriate practice remains undefined. STUDY DESIGN A review of patients who underwent primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between January 2002 and December 2008 was conducted. All underwent routine UGI studies on postoperative day 1. Actual gastrojejunal leak within 7 days of surgery (actual leak [AL], radiologic leaks), operative reports, patient charts, and postoperative vital signs were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS There were 2,099 operations. Eight ALs (0.43%) occurred without associated mortality. UGI was positive in 7 AL patients and falsely positive in 6 patients. The AL patients underwent laparoscopy on postoperative days 1 and 3 (n = 5 and n = 1, respectively), laparotomy on postoperative day 3 (n = 1), and peritoneal drainage (n = 1). False-positive UGIs prompted laparoscopy (n = 3) and close observation (n = 3). Pulse was 100 to 120 beats per minute in 2 patients and fever (>38.5°C) was present in 0 AL patients. AL patients had osteogenesis imperfecta (n = 1), macronodular cirrhosis (n = 1), positive bubble test (n = 3), and concomitant splenectomy (n = 1). No jejunojejunostomy leaks were identified. CONCLUSIONS Routine UGI after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass has greater sensitivity than clinical signs for detecting gastrojejunal leak. Delay in the diagnosis of leakage can impact mortality, and this suggests that indications for routine UGI might still exist. Tachycardia is not a reliable early marker of leak. There might be risk factors for leak in addition to vital signs, including patient medical history or intraoperative events, which should prompt routine UGI on postoperative day 1.

Flexible employment relationships and careers in times of the COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic represents a crisis that affects several aspects of people's lives around the globe. Most of the affected countries took several measures, like lockdowns, business shutdowns, hygiene regulations, social distancing, school and university closings, or mobility tracking as a means of slowing down the distribution of COVID-19. These measures are expected to show short-term and long-term effects on people's working lives. However, most media reports focused on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on changes in work arrangements (e.g., short-time work, flexible location and hours) for workers in a regular employment relationship. We here focus on workers in flexible employment relationships (e.g. temporary agency work and other forms of subcontracted labor, as well as new forms of working, such as in the gig economy). Specifically, we will discuss (a) how the work and careers of individuals in flexible employment relationships might get affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) outline ideas how to examine period effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the work and careers of those individuals, and (c) outline how the pandemic can contribute to the ramification of flexible employment relationships.

Infeccion Por Sars-Cov-2 En La Paciente Obstetrica: Una Perspectiva Desde El Cuidado Critico

ABSTRACT The new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is currently the leading public health problem in the world. Between 5% and 30% of patients affected by this disease require management in an intensive care unit. Different documents have been published with recommendations for the general population. However, in the obstetric patient, the scientific evidence is limited, and even more so when it comes to COVID-19 infection in obstetric intensive care settings. For this reason, an unsystematic narrative review of the literature was performed using MEDLINE, scientific societies, as well as the repositories of the World Health Organisation and the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Colombia as sources of information, in order to describe the management of a pregnant patient with COVID-19 in an intensive care unit. It is emphasised that care must be carried out by a multidisciplinary team, using maternal and fetal monitoring when appropriate. It is also suggested that there must be monitoring of oxygen saturation and maternal haemodynamics in order to minimise fetal hypoxaemia. A description is also presented of some recommendations on relevant topics in the critical scenario that include, among others, timely intubation, the adequate use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), the management of circulatory failure, as well as fluid and vasopressor restriction strategies.

Cutaneous manifestations in hospitalized patients diagnosed as COVID‐19

BACKGROUND: Cutaneous manifestations of COVID‐19 disease have not yet been fully described. OBJECTIVES: To describe cutaneous manifestations of COVID‐19 disease in hospitalized patients. METHODS: We examined the cutaneous manifestations of 210 hospitalized patients. RESULTS: Cutaneous findings were observed during COVID‐19 infection in 52 of the patients. Lesions may be classified as erythematous scaly rash (32.7%), maculopapular rash (23%), urticarial lesions (13.5%), petechial purpuric rash (7.7%), necrosis (7.7%), enanthema and apthous stomatitis (5.8%), vesicular rash (5.8%), pernio (1.9%) and pruritus (1.9%). Cutaneous manifestations were observed statistically significantly more in certain age groups: patients of 55 to 64 and 65 to 74 years of age complained of more cutaneous manifestations than the other age groups. As for gender, there was no significant difference between male and female patients in terms of cutaneus findings. The relationship between comorbidity and dermatological finding status was statistically significant. The relationship increases linearly according to the comorbidities. According the statistical results the patients who were hospitalized in the intensive care unit had a higher risk of having cutaneous findings due to COVID‐19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: With this study we may highlight the importance of overlooked dermatological findings in patients that are hospitalized. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Overview of Current Therapeutics and Novel Candidates Against Influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infections

Emergence and re-emergence of respiratory virus infections represent a significant threat to global public health, as they occur seasonally and less frequently (such as in the case of influenza virus) as pandemic infections. Some of these viruses have been in the human population for centuries and others had recently emerged as a public health problem. Influenza viruses have been affecting the human population for a long time now; however, their ability to rapidly evolve through antigenic drift and antigenic shift causes the emergence of new strains. A recent example of these events is the avian-origin H7N9 influenza virus outbreak currently undergoing in China. Human H7N9 influenza viruses are resistant to amantadines and some strains are also resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors greatly limiting the options for treatment. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) may cause a lower respiratory tract infection characterized by bronchiolitis and pneumonia mainly in children and the elderly. Infection with RSV can cause severe disease and even death, imposing a severe burden for pediatric and geriatric health systems worldwide. Treatment for RSV is mainly supportive since the only approved therapy, a monoclonal antibody, is recommended for prophylactic use in high-risk patients. The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly emerging respiratory virus. The virus was first recognized in 2012 and it is associated with a lower respiratory tract disease that is more severe in patients with comorbidities. No licensed vaccines or antivirals have been yet approved for the treatment of MERS-CoV in humans. It is clear that the discovery and development of novel antivirals that can be used alone or in combination with existing therapies to treat these important respiratory viral infections are critical. In this review, we will describe some of the novel therapeutics currently under development for the treatment of these infections.

Equid herpesvirus type 4 uses a restricted set of equine major histocompatibility complex class I proteins as entry receptors.

Equid herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) was shown to use an unusual receptor for cellular entry - MHC-I molecules. Here, we demonstrated that the closely related EHV, EHV-4, also uses this strategy for cellular invasion, both in equine cells in culture and in the heterologous, non-permissive murine mastocytoma cell line (P815) after stable transfection with horse MHC-I genes. Using a panel of P815 cell lines transfected with individual horse MHC-I genes, we provided support for the hypothesis that EHV-1 and EHV-4 target classical polymorphic MHC-I molecules as viral entry receptors. All known equine MHC-I molecules from the two principal classical polymorphic loci specify alanine at position 173 (A173), whilst other MHC-I loci encoded different amino acids at this position and did not permit viral entry. Site-directed mutagenesis of position 173 diminished or enhanced viral entry, depending upon the initial amino acid. However, there were other, as yet undefined, constraints to this process: MHC-I genes from two non-classical loci carried A173 but did not enable viral entry in P815 transfectants. Our study suggested that the capacity to bind MHC-I molecules arose in the common ancestor of EHV-1 and EHV-4. The widespread occurrence of A173 in classical polymorphic horse MHC-I molecules indicated that horses of most MHC haplotypes should be susceptible to infection via this entry portal.

COVID-19 Information Seeking on Digital Media and Preventive Behaviors: The Mediation Role of Worry.

The high prevalence of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and inefficient preventive measures taken to curb the disease are significant public health concerns. Rapid and innovative advances in digital media offer opportunities for health education, which could result in increased preventive behaviors. This study assessed preventive behaviors against contracting COVID-19 and tested mediation pathways linking four types of digital media consumption (social media, mobile social networking apps [MSNs], online news media, and social live steaming services [SLSSs]) to preventive behaviors, mediated by worry. Results from an online survey (N = 511) revealed that the vast majority (>90 percent) of respondents had very often or always practiced preventive behaviors against contracting COVID-19 such as washing their hands more regularly with soap and water, staying away from crowded places, and wearing face masks out in public. In addition, COVID-19 information seeking through the four types of digital media was a salient parameter that encouraged people to practice preventive behaviors either directly or indirectly. Specifically, seeking COVID-19-related information on MSNs, SLSSs, and online news media was directly associated with preventive behaviors. Whereas COVID-19 information consumption on social media, MSNs, and SLSSs during the infectious disease outbreak could elicit intense worry and, in turn, increase preventive behaviors. The reasons for and implications of the results are discussed.

Rapid inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 with LED irradiation of visible spectrum wavelenghts

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis. The difficulty to control the viral spread due to the absence of vaccines and prophylactics measures has raised concerns about prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it becomes more and more crucial the reduction of environmental risk factors through viral inactivation of aerosols and fomites. Photodynamic inactivation of microorganisms by light energy emitted in the visible spectrum region (VIS), not harmful for mammalian cells and safe for humans, has recently been described. A LED-device emitting a special combination of frequencies in the visible light spectrum was tested on SARS-CoV-2 infected cell surnatant dilutions in order to evaluate the antiviral efficacy. This preliminary in vitro study showed for the first time the ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 through LED irradiation of visible spectrum wavelengths. If further and more extensive studies will confirm these data, the usage of this LED could potentially have a big impact on the sanitization of virtually all human environments.

How long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces? A systematic review

BACKGROUND: Inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections. The aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. METHODS: The literature was systematically reviewed in MedLine without language restrictions. In addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard textbooks on the topic were reviewed. All reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were included. RESULTS: Most gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. (including VRE), Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), or Streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. Many gram-negative species, such as Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, or Shigella spp., can also survive for months. A few others, such as Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus vulgaris, or Vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. Mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including Clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. Candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. Persistence of other yeasts, such as Torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (Candida parapsilosis, 14 days). Most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, SARS or rhino virus, can persist on surfaces for a few days. Viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, HAV, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. Blood-borne viruses, such as HBV or HIV, can persist for more than one week. Herpes viruses, such as CMV or HSV type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from only a few hours up to 7 days. CONCLUSION: The most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.

Chapter Eight Molecular Basis of Coronavirus Virulence and Vaccine Development

Abstract Virus vaccines have to be immunogenic, sufficiently stable, safe, and suitable to induce long-lasting immunity. To meet these requirements, vaccine studies need to provide a comprehensive understanding of (i) the protective roles of antiviral B and T-cell-mediated immune responses, (ii) the complexity and plasticity of major viral antigens, and (iii) virus molecular biology and pathogenesis. There are many types of vaccines including subunit vaccines, whole-inactivated virus, vectored, and live-attenuated virus vaccines, each of which featuring specific advantages and limitations. While nonliving virus vaccines have clear advantages in being safe and stable, they may cause side effects and be less efficacious compared to live-attenuated virus vaccines. In most cases, the latter induce long-lasting immunity but they may require special safety measures to prevent reversion to highly virulent viruses following vaccination. The chapter summarizes the recent progress in the development of coronavirus (CoV) vaccines, focusing on two zoonotic CoVs, the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), and the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV, both of which cause deadly disease and epidemics in humans. The development of attenuated virus vaccines to combat infections caused by highly pathogenic CoVs was largely based on the identification and characterization of viral virulence proteins that, for example, interfere with the innate and adaptive immune response or are involved in interactions with specific cell types, such as macrophages, dendritic and epithelial cells, and T lymphocytes, thereby modulating antiviral host responses and viral pathogenesis and potentially resulting in deleterious side effects following vaccination.

[Early experience in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy using the laparoscopic device for umbilical access SILS Port].

Since 2007, various urological procedures have been performed with laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS surgery), including nephrectomy, pyeloplasty, simple prostatectomy and, with the refinement of laparoscopic instrumentation, radical prostatectomy. This paper reports our initial experience in radical prostatectomy using the SILS Port from Covidiem and two lateral 5-mm trocars for triangulation. The SILS Port allows for accurate, simple insertion through a Hadson incision. The flexible port accommodates three 5-mm cannulas or two 5-mm cannulas and a 12-mm port for easier instrument exchange through a single incision. This approach decreases morbidity from bleeding, hernia and/or internal organ damage and improves cosmetic. One-port single-incision laparoscopy is part of the natural development of minimally invasive surgery. Future research is required to assess the intraoperative and postoperative benefits of LESS surgery as compared to standard laparoscopy.

[Advanced organ support and life-sustaining therapies in critically ill COVID-19 infected patients].

In critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection, the cardiorespiratory system may collapse by the following mechanisms: (1) cytokine storm, haemophagocytosis - septic shock, (2) uncontrollable hypoxaemia, (3) specific organ failure or multiple organ failure. In this summary, we review the currently available therapeutic options for the treatment and prevention of the above conditions. Removal of cytokines by CytoSorb haemoperfusion has been used more and more frequently and with encouraging success in recent years to treat septic shock. In the case of hypoxaemia, which can no longer be treated with conventional mechanical ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), inhaled epoprostenol and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) are considered. A common component of mostly late-stage organ failure is acute renal failure, which requires the initiation of one of the available continuous renal replacement therapies.

2-Cys peroxiredoxin function in intracellular signal transduction: therapeutic implications

H2O2 is a reactive oxygen species that has drawn much interest because of its role as a second messenger in receptor-mediated signaling. Mammalian 2-Cys peroxiredoxins have been shown to eliminate efficiently the H2O2 generated in response to receptor stimulation. 2-Cys peroxiredoxins are members of a novel peroxidase family that catalyze the H2O2 reduction reaction in the presence of thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase and NADPH. Several lines of evidence suggest that 2-Cys peroxiredoxins have dual roles as regulators of the H2O2 signal and as defenders of oxidative stress. In particular, 2-Cys peroxiredoxin appears to provide selective, specific and localized control of receptor-mediated signal transduction. Thus, the therapeutic potential of 2-Cys peroxiredoxins is clear for diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases, that involve reactive oxygen species.

Association between increased antenatal vaginal pH and preterm birth rate: a systematic review.

Background Worldwide, 14.9 million infants (11%) are born preterm each year. Up to 40% of preterm births (PTBs) are associated with genital tract infections. The vaginal pH can reflect changes in the vaginal milieu and, if elevated, indicates an abnormal flora or infection. Objective The aim of the study was to investigate whether an increased antenatal vaginal pH >4.5 in pre-labour pregnant women is associated with an increased PTB rate <37 completed weeks gestation. Search strategy Key databases included SCOPUS, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycInfo and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, complemented by hand search, up to January 2017. Selection criteria Primary research reporting vaginal pH assessment in pre-labour pregnant women and PTB rate. Data collection and analysis Data extraction and appraisal were carried out in a pre-defined standardised manner, applying the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) and Cochrane risk of bias tool. Analysis included calculation of risk difference (RD) and narrative synthesis. It was decided to abstain from pooling of the studies due to missing information in important moderators. Main results Of 986 identified records, 30 were included in the systematic review. The risk of bias was considered mostly high (40%) or moderate (37%). Fifteen studies permitted a calculation of RD. Of these, 14 (93%) indicated a positive association between increased antenatal vaginal pH and PTB (RD range: 0.02-0.75). Conclusion An increased antenatal vaginal pH >4.5 may be associated with a higher risk for PTB. It is recommended to conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the effectiveness of antenatal pH screening to prevent PTB. Tweetable abstract Pregnant women with an increased vaginal pH >4.5 may be at higher risk to experience preterm birth.

Enhancing ergosterol production in Pichia pastoris GS115 by overexpressing squalene synthase gene from Glycyrrhiza uralensis

Abstract The present study was designed to determine the effects of copy number variations (CNVs) of squalene synthase 1(SQS1) gene on the mevalonate (MVA) pathway. SQS1 gene from G. uralensis (GuSQS1) was cloned and over-expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. Six recombinant P. pastoris strains containing different copy number of GuSQS1 were constructed. HPLC was used to assay the level of ergosterol in all transgenic P. pastoris strains containing GuSQS1. HPLC analysis showed that the contents of ergosterol in all of the transgenic P. pastoris containing GuSQS1 were higher than that in the negative control. And with the increase of copy number of GuSQS1, the content of ergosterol showed an increasing-decreasing-increasing pattern. The contents of ergosterol in 10-copy-GuSQS1 P. pastoris and 47-copy-GuSQS1 P. pastoris were significantly higher than that in the rest recombinant P. pastoris strains. In conclusion, the CNVs of GuSQS1 influence the content of secondary metabolites in the MVA pathway. The present study provides a basis for over-expressing GuSQS1 and increasing the content of glycyrrhizin in G. uralensis cultivars.

Cardiological Society of India: Document on acute MI care during COVID-19

The unprecedented and rapidly spreading Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged public health care systems globally. Based on worldwide experience, India has initiated a nationwide lockdown to prevent the exponential surge of cases. During COVID-19, management of cardiovascular emergencies like acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) may be compromised. Cardiological Society of India (CSI) has ventured in this moment of crisis to evolve a consensus document for care of acute MI. However, this care should be individualized, based on local expertise and governmental advisories.

The smart city as time-space cartographer in COVID-19 control: the South Korean strategy and democratic control of surveillance technology

While the US, UK, France, Italy, and many other countries ended up implementing complete lockdown after tens of thousands of deaths from COVID-19, South Korea kept factories and offices running, flattened the curve, and maintained a low mortality rate. Extensive media coverage has focused on South Korea’s testing capacity as the primary reason, but there has been little discussion of the vital role of the smart city. In this paper, we describe how smart city technologies form a crucial part of disease control in South Korea, explain the social conditions for the extensive use of smart city technology, and offer critical insights into contemporary discussions on the issue of smart cities and surveillance.

Type C Virus Expression in Lymphoma-Paralysis-Prone Wild Mice

Wild mice trapped near Lake Casitas (LC) in southern California showed a high prevalence of infectious type C virus in the liver, spleen, and thymus within the first few weeks of life. By young adulthood about 80% of LC mice (including their genital tissues) were infected. Virus isolates from these mice cause lymphoma and lower limb paralysis under both natural and experimental conditions. Mice destined to develop paralysis showed higher levels of serum gs antigen early in life, whereas mice destined to develop lymphoma or remain free of these diseases could not be distinguished by this test. The individual variation in virus expression suggested that differences in virus type or in the immune or other host defense mechanisms greatly influenced susceptibility or resistance to indigenous type C virus-caused disease in LC wild mice.

Alphavirus minus-strand synthesis and persistence in mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from mice lacking RNase L and protein kinase R.

We report our studies to probe the possible role of the host response to double-stranded RNA in cessation of alphavirus minus-strand synthesis. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) from Mx1-deficient mice that also lack either the protein kinase R (PKR) or the latent RNase L or both PKR and RNase L were screened. In RNase L-deficient but not wild-type or PKR-deficient MEF, there was continuous synthesis of minus-strand templates and the formation of new replication complexes producing viral plus strands. Inhibiting translation caused minus-strand synthesis to stop and a loss of transcription activity of the mature replication complexes. This turnover of replication complexes that were stable in cells containing RNase L suggested that RNase L plays some role, albeit possibly indirect, in the formation of stable replication complexes during alphavirus infection. In addition, confluent monolayers of RNase L-deficient murine cells readily established persistent infections and were not killed. This phenotype is contrary to what has been observed for infection in vertebrate cells with a presumably functional RNase L gene and more resembled alphavirus replication in Aedes mosquito cells, in which the activity of replication complexes making plus stands was also found to decay with inhibition of translation.

Xenotransplantation: an ethical dilemma.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW Xenotransplantation is an attractive alternative to allogeneic transplantation because of the intractable shortage of donor organs. The latest published developments in this area are discussed as well as recent publications regarding the continuing debates on the ethics of xenotransplantation and the safeguards that should be imposed to assure the minimization of risk to the patient and to human societies. RECENT FINDINGS Several laboratories are concentrating on the development of genetically manipulated donor pigs in order to bypass the immunological barriers against transplantation of porcine organs and cells into humans. Preliminary experiments with these new pig strains suggest that this strategy has a high likelihood of success with respect to hyperacute rejection. Ethical considerations have been extended to the establishment of regulatory, legal, and ethical frameworks that will be necessary to minimize the risk of xenotransplantation to the recipients, their families, and to the worldwide community. SUMMARY Xenotransplantation, because of the complexity of the medical, ethical and legal issues, will likely remain a controversial issue. If the scientific problems are solved, the decision to proceed with clinical application of this technique will depend on a collective decision guided by ethical, regulatory, and legal frameworks established by consensus.

Initial experience of coiling cerebral aneurysms using the new Comaneci device.

We present our initial patient experience with an innovative temporary bridging device, the Comaneci (Rapid Medical, Israel), to assist in the coiling of cerebral aneurysms. The Comaneci device confers the same benefits as balloon remodeling but without the risks of parent artery occlusion. This alleviates time pressure on the clinician, and could reduce the risk of parent artery thrombosis. Three patients were treated with the Comaneci device. Two patients had acute ruptured posterior communicating aneurysms and one patient was treated electively for a carotico-ophthalmic aneurysm. Excellent occlusion of all three aneurysms was obtained. One patient developed a distal middle cerebral artery clot, that was treated with intravenous aspirin, with minor neurological consequences. These early results show that the Comaneci device can be used to achieve good cerebral aneurysm occlusion. Vessel patency is maintained throughout the procedure with potential advantages over conventional balloon assisted coiling.

[Clinical features of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection: an analysis of 13 cases from Changsha, China]

OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical features of children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 13 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection who hospitalized in a Changsha hospital. RESULTS: All 13 children had the disease onset due to family aggregation. Of the 13 children, 2 had no symptoms, and the other 11 children had the clinical manifestations of fever, cough, pharyngeal discomfort, abdominal pain, diarrhea, convulsions, or vomiting. As for clinical typing, 7 had mild type, 5 had common type, and 1 had severe type. The median duration of fever was 2 days in 6 children. All 13 children had normal levels of peripheral blood lymphocyte counts, immunoglobulins, CD4, CD8, and interleukin-6. The median time to clearance of SARS-CoV-2 was 13 days in the nasopharyngeal swabs of the 13 children. Three children presented false negatives for RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable in stools for 12 days after the nasopharyngeal swab test yielded a negative result. Abnormal CT findings were observed in 6 children. All 13 children were cured and discharged and they were normal at 2 weeks after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-family contact is the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, and there is also a possibility of fecal-oral transmission. Mild and common types are the major clinical types in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cytokine storm is not observed. Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection tend to have a good short-term prognosis, and follow-up is needed to observe their long-term prognosis. Multiple nucleic acid tests should be performed for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their close contacts by multiple site sampling.

The Molecular Biology of Frog Virus 3 and other Iridoviruses Infecting Cold-Blooded Vertebrates

Frog virus 3 (FV3) is the best characterized member of the family Iridoviridae. FV3 study has provided insights into the replication of other family members, and has served as a model of viral transcription, genome replication, and virus-mediated host-shutoff. Although the broad outlines of FV3 replication have been elucidated, the precise roles of most viral proteins remain unknown. Current studies using knock down (KD) mediated by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (asMO) and small, interfering RNAs (siRNA), knock out (KO) following replacement of the targeted gene with a selectable marker by homologous recombination, ectopic viral gene expression, and recombinant viral proteins have enabled researchers to systematically ascertain replicative- and virulence-related gene functions. In addition, the application of molecular tools to ecological studies is providing novel ways for field biologists to identify potential pathogens, quantify infections, and trace the evolution of ecologically important viral species. In this review, we summarize current studies using not only FV3, but also other iridoviruses infecting ectotherms. As described below, general principles ascertained using FV3 served as a model for the family, and studies utilizing other ranaviruses and megalocytiviruses have confirmed and extended our understanding of iridovirus replication. Collectively, these and future efforts will elucidate molecular events in viral replication, intrinsic and extrinsic factors that contribute to disease outbreaks, and the role of the host immune system in protection from disease.

Nifedipine GITS/Candesartan Combination Therapy Lowers Blood Pressure Across Different Baseline Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure Categories: DISTINCT Study Subanalyses.

DISTINCT was an 8-week, double-blind, randomized study to investigate the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of various nifedipine gastrointestinal treatment system (GITS)/candesartan cilexetil (N/C) dose combinations, vs respective monotherapies or placebo, in patients with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥95 to <110 mm Hg. The current prespecified analysis compared BP reduction in participants with mild vs moderate baseline hypertension (ie, systolic [S]BP <160 mm Hg vs ≥160 mm Hg and DBP <100 mm Hg vs ≥100 mm Hg). A total of 1362 patients were analyzed by descriptive statistics. In all patient subgroups investigated, the NC combinations (ie, N: 20, 30, or 60 mg; C: 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg daily) provided greater SBP and DBP lowering and higher rates of BP control (defined as BP <140/90 mm Hg) than respective monotherapies or placebo, with greatest absolute BP reductions observed in the moderately elevated SBP or DBP subgroups. A trend to dose-response relationship was observed in each subgroup. In each SBP and DBP subgroup, treatment-related vasodilatory events (flushing, headache, or edema) were less frequent for patients receiving NC combination therapy than N monotherapy. These analyses support the use of calcium antagonist and angiotensin receptor blocker combination therapy in patients with both mild and moderate hypertension, for whom effective BP normalization and good drug tolerance would greatly reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.

Immunology of COVID‐19: mechanisms, clinical outcome, diagnostics and perspectives – a report of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI)

With the worldwide spread of the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) resulting in declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, the SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced Coronavirus disease‐19 (COVID‐19) has become one of the main challenges of our times. The high infection rate and the severe disease course led to major safety and social restriction measures worldwide. There is an urgent need of unbiased expert knowledge guiding the development of efficient treatment and prevention strategies. This report summarizes current immunological data on mechanisms associated with the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 development and progression to the most severe forms. We characterize the differences between adequate innate and adaptive immune response in mild disease and the deep immune dysfunction in the severe multi‐organ disease. The similarities of the human immune response to SARS‐CoV‐2 and the SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV are underlined. We also summarize known and potential SARS‐CoV‐2 receptors on epithelial barriers, immune cells, endothelium and clinically involved organs such as lung, gut, kidney, cardiovascular and neuronal system. Finally, we discuss the known and potential mechanisms underlying the involvement of comorbidities, gender and age in development of COVID‐19. Consequently, we highlight the knowledge gaps and urgent research requirements to provide a quick roadmap for ongoing and needed COVID‐19 studies.

Epidemiological investigations in regard to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in Quebec, Canada. Part 1: biosecurity practices and their geographical distribution in two areas of different swine density.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a considerable threat to the swine industry and implementing biosecurity measures is essential for the control of its transmission. The aims of this study were: (1) to describe biosecurity practices in production sites located in a moderate density (MD) and a high density (HD) pig area according to production type; (2) to group sites in different patterns according to their biosecurity practices; and (3) to determine the geographical distribution of sites according to biosecurity patterns. Biosecurity practices were selected based on PRRS epidemiology. A questionnaire was completed on 125 breeding sites (MD=54; HD=71) and 120 growing (HD) sites, between 2005 and 2008. Depending on area and production type, the frequency of biosecurity practices used ranged from 0 to 2% for barrier at site entrance, 0 to 19% for use of shower, 25 to 35% for washing truck between loads of pigs, 51 to 57% for absence of rendering or rendering without access to the site, and 26 to 51% for absence of gilt purchase or purchase with quarantine. Better practices pertaining to entrance protocol (i.e. "no-entry" sign, shower, ≥24 h downtime) were reported more frequently on breeding sites in the MD than the HD area (P<0.05). In the HD area, growing sites had in general a lower level of biosecurity than breeding sites. Using a two-step clustering procedure performed separately for breeding and growing sites, two different patterns were obtained for each production type, which corresponded to a high and low level of biosecurity. For breeding sites, a higher biosecurity level was observed at sites located away from other pig sites, set at more than 300 m from the public road, having higher sow inventory, or being part of an integrated production (P<0.05). Spatial clusters of sites for each biosecurity pattern were detected. This study identified some shortcomings regarding biosecurity that should be addressed before implementing any PRRSV regional control. Vicinity of sites with different biosecurity levels also suggests difficulties in planning priorities of intervention based on geographical distribution of sites.

Two known therapies could be useful as adjuvant therapy in critical patients infected by COVID-19

Abstract Pneumonia caused by coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, has been spread around the world already becoming a pandemic. Unfortunately, there is not yet a specific vaccine or effective antiviral drug for treating COVID-19. Many of these patients deteriorate rapidly and require intubation and are mechanically ventilated, which is causing the collapse of the health system in many countries due to lack of ventilators and intensive care beds. In this document we review two simple adjuvant therapies to administer, without side effects, and low cost that could be useful for the treatment of acute severe coronavirus infection associated with acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). VitaminC, a potent antioxidant, has emerged as a relevant therapy due to its potential benefits when administered intravenous. The potential effect of vitaminC in reducing inflammation in the lungs could play a key role in lung injury caused by coronavirus infection. Another potential effective therapy is ozone: it has been extensively studied and used for many years and its effectiveness has been demonstrated so far in multiples studies. Nevertheless, our goal is not to make an exhaustive review of these therapies but spread the beneficial effects themselves. Obviously clinical trials are necessaries, but due to the potential benefit of these two therapies we highly recommended to add to the therapeutic arsenal.

Patellar fractures in adults.

Patellar fracture is a common injury caused by excessive tension through the extensor mechanism or a direct blow. The intact patella increases the leverage and efficiency of the extensor mechanism and articulates with the femoral trochlea. Patellar fractures can lead to stiffness, extension weakness, and patellofemoral arthritis. Nonsurgical management is indicated for nondisplaced fractures with an intact extensor mechanism. Surgical fixation is recommended for fractures that either disrupt the extensor mechanism or demonstrate >2 to 3 mm step-off and >1 to 4 mm of displacement. Anatomic reduction and fixation with a tension-band technique is associated with the best outcomes; however, symptomatic hardware is a frequent complication. Open fractures are associated with more complications than closed fractures. These complications can be mitigated with timely débridement, irrigation, and internal fixation.

Immunoinformatics and Structural Analysis for Identification of Immunodominant Epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 as Potential Vaccine Targets.

A new coronavirus infection, COVID-19, has recently emerged, and has caused a global pandemic along with an international public health emergency. Currently, no licensed vaccines are available for COVID-19. The identification of immunodominant epitopes for both B- and T-cells that induce protective responses in the host is crucial for effective vaccine design. Computational prediction of potential epitopes might significantly reduce the time required to screen peptide libraries as part of emergent vaccine design. In our present study, we used an extensive immunoinformatics-based approach to predict conserved immunodominant epitopes from the proteome of SARS-CoV-2. Regions from SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences were defined as immunodominant, based on the following three criteria regarding B- and T-cell epitopes: (i) they were both mapped, (ii) they predicted protective antigens, and (iii) they were completely identical to experimentally validated epitopes of SARS-CoV. Further, structural and molecular docking analyses were performed in order to understand the binding interactions of the identified immunodominant epitopes with human major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Our study provides a set of potential immunodominant epitopes that could enable the generation of both antibody- and cell-mediated immunity. This could contribute to developing peptide vaccine-based adaptive immunotherapy against SARS-CoV-2 infections and prevent future pandemic outbreaks.

Molecular Phylogeny of Hantaviruses Harbored by Insectivorous Bats in Côte d’Ivoire and Vietnam

The recent discovery of genetically distinct hantaviruses in multiple species of shrews and moles prompted a further exploration of their host diversification by analyzing frozen, ethanol-fixed and RNAlater(®)-preserved archival tissues and fecal samples from 533 bats (representing seven families, 28 genera and 53 species in the order Chiroptera), captured in Asia, Africa and the Americas in 1981–2012, using RT-PCR. Hantavirus RNA was detected in Pomona roundleaf bats (Hipposideros pomona) (family Hipposideridae), captured in Vietnam in 1997 and 1999, and in banana pipistrelles (Neoromicia nanus) (family Vespertilionidae), captured in Côte d’Ivoire in 2011. Phylogenetic analysis, based on the full-length S- and partial M- and L-segment sequences using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, demonstrated that the newfound hantaviruses formed highly divergent lineages, comprising other recently recognized bat-borne hantaviruses in Sierra Leone and China. The detection of bat-associated hantaviruses opens a new era in hantavirology and provides insights into their evolutionary origins.

Surgical Swine Model of Chronic Cardiac Ischemia Treated by Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery.

Chronic cardiac ischemia that impairs cardiac function, but does not result in infarct, is termed hibernating myocardium (HM). A large clinical subset of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients have HM, which in addition to causing impaired function, puts them at higher risk for arrhythmia and future cardiac events. The standard treatment for this condition is revascularization, but this has been shown to be an imperfect therapy. The majority of pre-clinical cardiac research focuses on infarct models of cardiac ischemia, leaving this subset of chronic ischemia patients largely underserved. To address this gap in research, we have developed a well-characterized and highly reproducible model of hibernating myocardium in swine, as swine are ideal translational models for human heart disease. In addition to creating this unique disease model, we have optimized a clinically relevant treatment model of coronary artery bypass surgery in swine. This allows us to accurately study the effects of bypass surgery on heart disease, as well as investigate additional or alternate therapies. This model surgically induces single vessel stenosis by implanting a constrictor on the left anterior descending (LAD) artery in a young pig. As the pig grows, the constrictor creates a gradual stenosis, resulting in chronic ischemia with impaired regional function, but preserving tissue viability. Following the establishment of the hibernating myocardium phenotype, we perform off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery to revascularize the ischemic region, mimicking the gold-standard treatment for patients in the clinic.

Clinical utility of the Covidien Closure Fast™ Endovenous Radiofrequency Ablation Catheter.

The Closure Fast™ Endovenous Radiofrequency Ablation Catheter is the latest version of a minimally invasive system for the treatment of patients with superficial venous disease. The Closure Fast™ catheter heats the vein wall to 120°C, causing denaturation of the collagen of the vein wall and contraction of the vessel such that no blood can flow through it. Nearly one million systems have been sold since the product was launched. Many, if not all, patients can be treated under local anesthesia with the Closure Fast™ catheter. Duplex ultrasound reports occlusion rates for the treated vein of 94%-98% at 1 year and 85%-93% at 3 years. The system produces average postoperative pain scores of less than 2 out of 10 on a visual analog score. In the first postoperative week, 76% of patients do not require analgesia. Some 45% of patients return to normal activity on the first postoperative day. Serious complications appear to be rare following the Closure Fast™ procedure. Transient paresthesia occurs in 0.2% of cases, thrombophlebitis in 1%-10%, and thromboembolic events in up to 1.4%, mainly heat-induced thrombosis. Closure Fast™ adds significant costs to treating superficial venous disease but studies have shown it to be cost-effective when used in an office setting.

Involvement of miR-15a in G0/G1 Phase Cell Cycle Arrest Induced by Porcine Circovirus Type 2 Replication

Many viruses exploit the host cell division cycle to favour their own growth. Here we demonstrated that porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), which is a major causative agent of an emerging and important swine disease complex, PCV2-associated diseases, caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest through degradation of cyclin D1 and E followed by reduction of retinoblastoma phosphorylation in synchronized PCV2-infected cells dependent upon virus replication. This induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest promoted PCV2 replication as evidenced by increased viral protein expression and progeny virus production in the synchronized PCV2-infected cells. To delineate a mechanism of miRNAs in regulating PCV2-induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, we determined expression levels of some relevant miRNAs and found that only miR-15a but not miR-16, miR-21, and miR-34a was significantly changed in the PCV2-infected cells. We further demonstrated that upregulation of miR-15a promoted PCV2-induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest via mediating cyclins D1 and E degradation, in which involves PCV2 growth. These results reveal that G0/G1 cell cycle arrest induced by PCV2 may provide favourable conditions for viral protein expression and progeny production and that miR-15a is implicated in PCV2-induced cell cycle control, thereby contributing to efficient viral replication.

Genomic medicine and developing countries: creating a room of their own

The notion that developing countries must wait for the developed world to make advances in science and technology that they later import at great cost is being challenged. We have previously argued that developing countries can harness human genetic variation to benefit their populations and economies. Based on our empirical studies of large-scale population genotyping projects in Mexico, India and Thailand, we describe how these resources are being adopted to improve public health and create knowledge-based economies. A significant additional benefit is building the capacity for scientific research and internalizing advances in technology, whatever their source.

Visual Sensor for Sterilization of Polymer Fixtures Using Embedded Mesoporous Silicon Photonic Crystals.

A porous photonic crystal is integrated with a plastic medical fixture (IV connector hub) to provide a visual colorimetric sensor to indicate the presence or absence of alcohol used to sterilize the fixture. The photonic crystal is prepared in porous silicon (pSi) by electrochemical anodization of single crystal silicon, and the porosity and the stop band of the material is engineered such that the integrated device visibly changes color (green to red or blue to green) when infiltrated with alcohol. Two types of self-reporting devices are prepared and their performance compared: the first type involves heat-assisted fusion of a freestanding pSi photonic crystal to the connector end of a preformed polycarbonate hub, forming a composite where the unfilled portion of the pSi film acts as the sensor; the second involves generation of an all-polymer replica of the pSi photonic crystal by complete thermal infiltration of the pSi film and subsequent chemical dissolution of the pSi portion. Both types of sensors visibly change color when wetted with alcohol, and the color reverts to the original upon evaporation of the liquid. The sensor performance is verified using E. coli-infected samples.

Knowledge, Perceptions and Practices of Community Pharmacists Towards Antimicrobial Stewardship: A Systematic Scoping Review.

The scope of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) surveys on community pharmacists (CPs) is uncertain. This study examines the breadth and quality of AMS survey tools measuring the stewardship knowledge, perceptions and practices (KPP) of CPs and analyse survey outcomes. Following PRISMA-ScR checklist and Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework seven medical databases were searched. Two reviewers independently screened the literatures, assessed quality of surveys and KPP outcomes were analysed and described. Ten surveys were identified that assessed CPs' AMS perceptions (n = 7) and practices (n = 8) but none that assessed AMS knowledge. Three survey tools had been formally validated. Most CPs perceived that AMS improved patient care (median 86.0%, IQR, 83.3-93.5%, n = 6), and reduced inappropriate antibiotic use (84.0%, IQR, 83-85%, n = 2). CPs collaborated with prescribers for infection control (54.7%, IQR 34.8-63.2%, n = 4) and for uncertain antibiotic treatment (77.0%, IQR 55.2-77.8%, n = 5). CPs educated patients (53.0%, IQR, 43.2-67.4%, n = 5) and screened guideline-compliance of antimicrobial prescriptions (47.5%, IQR, 25.2-58.3%, n = 3). Guidelines, training, interactions with prescribers, and reimbursement models were major barriers to CP-led AMS implementation. A limited number of validated survey tools are available to assess AMS perceptions and practices of CPs. AMS survey tools require further development to assess stewardship knowledge, stewardship targets, and implementation by CPs.

Nasal epithelial repair and remodeling in physical injury, infection, and inflammatory diseases.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW To summarize the current knowledge of cellular and molecular mechanisms of nasal epithelial repair and remodeling during physical and pathophysiological conditions. RECENT FINDINGS Nasal epithelial repair and remodeling is a highly organized and well coordinated process, involving inflammation, proliferation, differentiation, matrix deposition, and remodeling, and is regulated by a wide variety of growth factors and cytokines. From the in-vivo and in-vitro studies conducted in both human and animal models, undifferentiated basal cells (progenitors) are able to migrate from adjacent epithelium, spread over the denuded basement membrane, and proliferate in injured regions (self-renewal) in necessary (homeostasis) or excessive (hyperplasia) degree. Progenitor cells reorient to an apical-basal polarity, and progressively differentiate into ciliated and nonciliated columnar cells and goblet cells, reconstituting a functional respiratory epithelium after several weeks. This recovery process can be observed during various types and severity of injury, and also in common nasal diseases, including acute viral, allergic, and nonallergic rhinitis, as well as chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps. SUMMARY Although nearly 10 000 articles about nasal epithelium have been published in the last decade, the mechanisms underlying the nasal epithelial repair are still understood at only a superficial descriptive level. In order to advance rhinology to the next level of a comprehensive knowledge of the orchestrated genetic and molecular processes acting during epithelial repair, combined clinical and experimental studies using sophisticated investigational plans to elucidate the functions of both the protein-coding and regulatory portions of the human genome are required.
