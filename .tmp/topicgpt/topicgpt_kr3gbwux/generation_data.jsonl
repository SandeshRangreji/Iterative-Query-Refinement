I too was a patient of Dr. Pickards who was transferred over to Dr. Drain.    The attitude of the clinic is completely uncaring and irresponsible.  They should have some responsibility for the patients under the clinic's care.  They point you in the direction of 'find a doctor' and show you the door.  There is no concern for those patients who need a doctor and are not going to replace Dr. Drain in a few weeks.  Connected care does not work well and all you can do it wait."}

To make matters worse after finding a new doctor they said it would be two weeks for me to pick up my records. She was not concerned with withdrawals from the medication she prescribed for 7 years. Who does that"}

{"id": "2478043", "text": "Beware of doctors with a medical degree from a foreign country, especially Iran! This particular office is understaffed with a long wait time for an appointment. The majority of patients in the office were from Iran and most likely preferred a a doctor fluent in Farci. Most doctors have an adequate nursing staff to conduct blood tests, lab work, etc., yet Nasrin has very few if any support staff, and hence had to conduct all lab work by herself increasing the wait time even further. More importantly, her office never contacted me after the tests to let me know the results, not surprising at all. The item that garners the most attention is Nasrin's thirty year old medical diploma from a university in Iran. I can trust the merit of a medical degree from a third world, oppressive country about as much as a used car salesman on PCP. Don't choose this doctor!!"}
{"id": "607838", "text": "I was happy with my care with Dr. Thomas. Unfortunately she moved to a \"concierge \" service with a monthly fee no matter whether you see her or not so I can no longer afford to have her as my doctor. I might only go to a doctor once a year so a monthly fee is not worth it for me. Hard enough to pay for insurance let alone paying another monthly fee. It is work to find a doctor you trust, I am sad Dr. Thomas decided to push good patients out by moving to a concierge monthly fee service."}

{"id": "2763671", "text": "Patience and Patients!  Dr. Crescitelli's Office has both!  He does not rush through a visit to get to the next person.  Likewise, he will devote as much time to you as you need.  I don't mind waiting for this service! I receive the very best care, referrals and get all my questions asked and answered in laymen terminology.  Dr. C is intelligent, humorous as needed, a fantastic diagnostician and an all around good guy.\nSometimes he will not accept new patients as his case load exceeds the amount of people his office and staff can handle while giving his current patients quality service.\nAdditionally, insurance companies change from year to year.  Often times patients don't have a PPO or HMO that is accepted by every Doctor.\nUnless he leaves his practice or I leave this earth, he will be my doctor!  His office staff is first rate also! 10 stars awarded\n?? ??????????????????"}

I am not a nurse, or a doctor of any kind, & although I understand the concerns of physically seeing a high-risk elderly patient, during this pandemic; however, in over 4 months, Dr. Pfeffer has been the only one even offering us a choice, let alone, physically seeing my mom. We are very pleased with his willingness to allow us to choose, & to take the time out to secure her safety & well-being throughout our entire visit. Our follow-up with him, will be through TeleHealth; however, the choice & the attention given to her, during her visit, has given me some confidence that we can go another 3 months without, physically, seeing a Doctor. We are very grateful for the peace of mind, & courteousness that Dr. Pfeffer have to my Mom."}
