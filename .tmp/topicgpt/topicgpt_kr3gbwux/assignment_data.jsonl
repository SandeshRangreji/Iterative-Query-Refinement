I too was a patient of Dr. Pickards who was transferred over to Dr. Drain.    The attitude of the clinic is completely uncaring and irresponsible.  They should have some responsibility for the patients under the clinic's care.  They point you in the direction of 'find a doctor' and show you the door.  There is no concern for those patients who need a doctor and are not going to replace Dr. Drain in a few weeks.  Connected care does not work well and all you can do it wait."}

He diagnosed my back pain just as every other doctor I have seen and prescribed me medication that didn't really seem to work.  I explained this and was referred onto another doctor.  When explaining that I needed stronger/different medication, I was denied.  The most recent office visit I had amounted to the an expensive co-pay and no relief from my pain.  I kept getting referred back and forth between the doctor and the specialist as to who would prescribe me something that actually worked, but while waiting for them to communicate with one another I just sat in pain.  Having lost two jobs now due to chronic back pain causing me to miss days of work, it has gotten to the point to where I must seek a new primary physician; someone who will actually listen to me and prescribe a treatment that will actually provide some relief.  In closing, I highly suggest anyone looking for a new primary physician to look elsewhere."}

Dr Darcy has been a huge help to me.  She listens and works with me to find a plan we can both agree on.  Her confidence in me and support when times are tough is a huge relief.  She steps up and takes control when other doctors have treated me like I'm just another run of the mill patient.  If you need a doctor that will work with you in a partnership, she will help you.  And she's worth the wait because she takes her time with her patients."}
